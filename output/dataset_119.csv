2762434,R v Cornell [2013] NSWDC 246,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: On 19 August 2013 Ms Hiba Cornell was found guilty by a jury on one charge of dishonestly damaging property. The maximum penalty for that offence is seven years imprisonment. The charge related to some damage that was occasioned to Ms Cornell's own car. It was scratched all over, one of the headlights was smashed and later the windscreen was smashed as well. The damage was so extensive that the car was written off by Ms Cornell's insurer, Allianz Insurance Limited. She received a payout of the agreed value of the car.

2The only issue at trial was why the car was damaged. There was no dispute as to who had damaged it. The Crown said that it was damaged pursuant to an agreement between Ms Cornell and her son-in-law, Mr Radwan Barbour so that the insurance claim could be made. But the defence case was that Mr Barbour arranged for the vehicle to be damaged, and then damaged it himself as well, because he was angry with Ms Cornell. Clearly, the jury accepted the Crown version. 

3The Crown case was largely based on intercepted telephone calls. Police were investigating another matter, or even matters, when they overheard incriminating calls relating to the damage of Ms Cornell's car and the subsequent insurance claim. Although Ms Cornell was careful when she spoke on the phone and was clearly aware of at least the possibility that her calls were being monitored, her husband being a detective in the New South Wales police force at the time, nevertheless on the calls at times there were highly incriminating things said, if not by Ms Cornell, then by others involved in the scheme, less disciplined about saying incriminating things on the telephone. 

4The Crown case ultimately, as a result of those telephone calls, was a strong one but without those calls it is unlikely that the offence would have been detected in the first place. That is a factor common to all offences of this type. They are difficult to detect. 

5I am to sentence Ms Cornell on the basis that she dishonestly arranged for her car to be damaged intending to receive the agreed value as a payment from the insurance company once the car was written off. The loss suffered by the insurer company was not, as offences of this type go, terribly large and if compensation payments are made will be quite small. The car was insured for something around $26,000. That was the agreed value. After it was damaged and written off it was sold at auction for about $11,500 with some smaller part of that being paid to Allianz. 

6Mr Barbour, the man who agreed to damage the car and subcontracted out part of that job has been ordered to pay half of the remaining loss to Allianz and it is conceded by Mr Breeze, who appears for Ms Cornell, that it would be appropriate to order her to pay the remainder. And so the direct costs to Allianz will, if those orders are paid, be quite low. The only loss to Allianz will be a loss of personnel time, people such as insurance assessors and investigators. 

7Certainly this was not a major piece of fraud. Indeed, this was one of the matters raised by Mr Breeze as part of the defence at the trial. It is difficult to understand ultimately what motivated Ms Cornell to do what she did. But commit this crime she most certainly did. 

8Ms Cornell is a person who has achieved a great deal in her life. There is much that she is entitled to be proud of. She pursued a career, and it was a successful one, in banking and finance and indeed she was employed at the Bank of Queensland at the time of this offence. As well as pursuing a career, she brought up her two children largely on her own. The father of the two children had not a great deal of a part to play in their upbringing and Ms Cornell's second husband, Mr Cornell, for his own reasons, has also played much less of a role in raising Ms Cornell's children than she has. 

9Of course, as a result of her conviction, her career in banking and finance is over. I was told that she has not worked since being arrested for this matter many years ago, whether in banking and finance or any other area. Although loss of a career in the finance industry is only to be expected if a person is convicted of an offence of dishonesty like this one, it is part of the punishment that Ms Cornell will undergo, that she will have to give up a career which clearly she enjoyed and was successful at. 

10I turn now to really one of the most important factors in assessing the appropriate sentence to impose upon Ms Cornell and I want to say quite clearly and plainly were it not for this factor Ms Cornell would go to gaol full-time. Her offence was serious and, ordinarily, in the absence of the factor I am about to mention, nothing less than full-time custody would be appropriate. Ms Cornell's daughter, Saara, was born with a significant injury. She suffers from sickle cell disease. Regular blood transfusions are required but one of the consequences of the disease has been, in Saara's case, the development of further problems. As a young child she suffered a stroke and is now affected by frontal lobe injury. And in more recent times she has begun to experience seizures, any one of which may be fatal. It is something of an understatement to say that Ms Cornell is Saara's primary carer, indeed in many respects, she is her only carer. Saara's problems are both physical and mental. I do not feel the need, in these public remarks on sentence, to go into the sort of behaviour that Saara exhibits but I will note that it is the sort of behaviour that requires careful and close attention by someone who is willing to look after her. The person who best fulfils that role is of course her mother, Ms Cornell. 

11One of the reports I received was from Professor Ho. I want to quote a single sentence from that report,

""I can confirm that Saara's sickle cell disease is a serious illness for which sickling crises can precipitate death, hence it is extremely important that she be optimally managed."" 

12In those circumstances I have no hesitation at all in finding that the consequences to Saara were her mother to be sent to gaol full-time are exceptional. 

13I cannot however let this matter pass without making this observation. There is always something distasteful about an offender relying on hardship to a family member as a reason for mitigation of punishment. At the time Ms Cornell committed this offence she knew full well that Saara needed her and that Saara would suffer significantly in the event that she went to gaol. Despite that knowledge, Ms Cornell committed this offence. She, herself, risked her own daughter's wellbeing. Despite that, I will take into account Saara's position in a significant way, so significant that, as I have said, it is the one feature which has stopped me sending Ms Cornell to gaol today. 

14This offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court. That is a matter I am obliged to take into account. It came to this Court as part of a larger indictment which included matters which were beyond the jurisdiction of the Local Court. It was then separated off and so the result is that this offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court. 

15I must also take into account the principles of parity. Mr Barbour was dealt with in the Local Court on a different charge. He received a s 9 bond. Ms Cornell should not a justifiable sense of grievance when she compares the sentence I impose upon her with the sentence imposed upon Mr Barbour. But there are some differences, not only as regards the charge but also as regards their role in this offence. The evidence would suggest that Ms Cornell was the moving party and it was she who recruited Mr Barbour who then recruited others. 

16This is Ms Cornell's first offence. She has a substantial bank of good character on which she is entitled to rely. She has good prospects for rehabilitation. There are some suggestions that this offence occurred during a lengthy period in which Ms Cornell was suffering from depression, anxiety and stress. It has to be said that the material before me today reveals things in her life about which she was entitled to be depressed, anxious and stressed. She is continuing to deal with those aspects of her personality, which makes it of course much less likely that any further offence will be committed. Indeed, part of the reason that I am satisfied Ms Cornell has good prospects of rehabilitation is the sentence that I will ultimately impose upon her. It will act as a deterrent to her against committing further offences in the future. 

17Mr Breeze suggested that a s 9 bond would be appropriate. Ms Cornell is not suitable for community service because of her need to care for her daughter so Mr Breeze's fallback position was a suspended sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act it being implicit in that submission that if I did impose a period of imprisonment it would be two years or less. Neither a bond under s 9 or a bond under s 12 are appropriate. As I said earlier, these offences are difficult to detect and the principle of general deterrence looms large in sentencing for offences of this kind. And on top of that, it cannot be denied that Ms Cornell must be punished for what she has done. 

18Her conduct was seriously dishonest and a bond, whether under s 9 or s 12, would be insufficient to reflect the objective gravity of what she did. A sentence of imprisonment should only be imposed as a last resort. But the circumstances of this case are such that that is the only penalty I consider appropriate. I am satisfied that the period of imprisonment should be two years and I turn now to considerations as to how that sentence should be served. 

19I note that the Crown does not suggest that the only available sentencing option to me is an immediate term of imprisonment. In my view, it is appropriate that in the event Ms Cornell is suitable, she be ordered to serve that sentence of imprisonment by way of an intensive corrections order. I will therefore grant bail to Ms Cornell pending ultimate determination of this matter in order that she can be assessed as to her suitability to serve the sentence of imprisonment in the manner I have foreshadowed.

20 This matter will be listed at 2 o'clock on 19 December 2013. Bail is granted to Ms Cornell until that day. And Ms Cornell, it's up to you to make sure that you are assessed by that day so you should not just rely on other people to contact you. If you are not assessed given that lengthy period that I've allowed, then I may have some things to say about your bail. You understand?

21I order that compensation be paid by Ms Cornell to Allianz Insurance Limited.

2762453,Eckersley v R [2013] NSWCCA 219,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J.

2LATHAM J : The applicant, Shannon Eckersley, applies for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him on 22 March 2011 by Sides QC DCJ, following pleas of guilty to the following offences :-

(1)Knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of MDMA (count one)
(2)Knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (count two)
(3)Supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of methyl amphetamine. (count three)

3Each of those offences carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

4When sentencing the applicant in respect of count one, four further offences were taken into account on a Form 1. Those further offences were knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, supplying a prohibited drug, namely 11 tablets of MDMA, supplying a prohibited drug, namely 5.8 g of cocaine, and supplying a prohibited drug, namely 2.78 g of MDMA.

5On count one, the sentencing judge imposed a term of imprisonment of 18 years, commencing 30 October 2011, with a non-parole period of 11 years. On each of counts two and three, the sentencing judge imposed term of imprisonment of 12 years, commencing 30 October 2008, with a non-parole period of eight years.

6The sentences for counts two and three (which were entirely concurrent) were accumulated upon the sentence imposed on count 1 to the extent of three years. The overall sentence was one of 21 years with an aggregate non-parole period of 14 years.

7The grounds of the appeal are :- 

(i)His Honour erred in finding that it was an aggravating feature that some of the drugs the subject of count one could be consumed by vulnerable persons, including children.
(ii)His Honour erred in the extent of the accumulation of the sentences for counts two and three upon the sentence for count one 
(iii)The overall sentence was manifestly excessive.

8Before proceeding to deal with these grounds, it is noted that there is no complaint with respect to the individual sentences. Nor is there any feature of the applicant's subjective case or any other finding made by his Honour that is relied upon for the purposes of this application.

9The applicant was sentenced on the basis of a statement of agreed facts. It is not necessary to reproduce those facts in full. It is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal to note the following :-

(a)The applicant undertook a ""very significant and managerial organisational"" role in two distinct manufacturing ventures, one in Blackett for the manufacture of methylamphetamine and another in Erskine Park for the manufacture of MDMA.

(b)The laboratory at Blackett contained items connected with the manufacture of prohibited drugs, together with purchase records relating to chemicals to the value of $617,000.00. In addition, 2,145 g of methylamphetamine was found in a safe in the premises (the subject of count three). A further 11 MDMA tablets found at these premises became the subject of the supply charge on the Form 1.

(c)The laboratory at Erskine Park also contained equipment and chemicals used to manufacture prohibited drugs. There was sufficient raw product at this laboratory to produce at least 250,000 MDMA tablets. The equipment at the site bore signs of consistent use. In September 2008 some 15,000 tablets of MDMA were moved from the laboratory post production.

(d)Other premises connected with the applicant and his co-offenders contained large quantities of chemicals and equipment used in the manufacture of drugs. One item located in an industrial unit at Moorebank was a pill press containing the applicant's fingerprint.

(e)A search of the applicant's home revealed 5.8 g of cocaine (the subject of a supply charge on the Form 1) and 2.78 g of ecstasy (the subject of the further supply charge on the Form 1).

(f)The charge of knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug taken into account on the Form 1 arose out of the manufacture of 20 litres of methyl amphetamine oil in May 2008.

10Ground one may be briefly dealt with.

11The applicant relies upon the following passage to support the contention that the sentencing judge made a positive but erroneous finding in relation to the existence of an aggravating feature :-
This was a substantial drug manufacturing business with the capacity to do substantial harm within the community and to earn substantial income to those involved.
The offender would not have known who would ultimately use the drugs produced by this business and it is possible that the vulnerable, such as children, may have ended up using some of it.

12I do not accept that a very experienced and learned sentencing judge, who made an observation of that nature, almost in passing, intended to indicate by that remark that he regarded that feature of the offence as an aggravating one. If the judge had so intended, I do not doubt that he would have used the relevant terminology. 

13In any event, the remark ought be understood in context. His Honour was merely referring to the capacity of the drug to do substantial harm within the community. The fact that persons under the age of 18 years are, regrettably, consumers of ecstasy is notorious. There is no error in acknowledging the extent and nature of the capacity for harm involved in the distribution of such drugs.

14I would refuse leave to rely upon this ground.

15It is convenient to deal with grounds two and three together.

16Yet again, this Court is being asked to find error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion with respect to the degree of accumulation having regard to the principle of totality. Whilst the applicant accepts that a degree of accumulation was warranted on the basis that counts one and two related to different drugs, it is submitted that ""this point of distinction ought not to have led to an accumulation of three years"".

17In addition, the applicant submits that the criminality in respect of count two only marginally increases the criminality encompassed by count one. It is said that these offences were committed over the same period of time, namely between 6 September 2007 and 30 October 2008, and that the applicant's role was identical in each case. It is further submitted that the fact that the drugs were produced at two separate laboratories ""should have little, if any, bearing upon the proper extent of the accumulation.""

18These submissions essentially failed to grapple with the only bases upon which this Court would be entitled to intervene, namely that some material error is disclosed by the reasons of the sentencing judge or the aggregate sentence itself is plainly unjust. The applicant does not contend for the former. 

19Having regard to the maximum penalty in respect of all three offences, the appropriate increase in the sentence in respect of count one arising out of the individually serious offences on the Form 1, the standard non-parole period of 15 years on all three offences, the period of the applicant's offending, and the pivotal role played by the applicant in the manufacture of two distinct prohibited drugs in two distinct locations, I am far from persuaded that an aggregate sentence of 21 years, including an aggregate non-parole period of 14 years is outside the range of a legitimate sentencing discretion. The aggregate non-parole period is in fact less than the standard non-parole period applying to each of the three offences. The aggregate sentence of 21 years represents a very insignificant increase on the sentence imposed for count one, a sentence with respect to which the applicant has no complaint.

20I would refuse leave to rely upon grounds two and three.

21The order I propose is leave to appeal refused.

22BELLEW J : I agree with Latham J.

2762456,Trindall v R [2013] NSWCCA 229,"Judgment
1EMMETT JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2R A HULME J:  Darren John Trindall (""the applicant"") was sentenced in the District Court on 25 September 2012 by his Honour Acting Judge Madgwick (""the judge"").
3In respect of three offences of stealing from the person and one offence of aggravated robbery (ss 94 and 95 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) the judge imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.  
4The sentence was specified to date from 23 July 2012.  The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 22 July 2016.
5The judge also sentenced the applicant in respect of a number of related summary offences (s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)).  They were offences of taking and driving a conveyance without the owner's consent; not stopping and driving recklessly when police were in pursuit; driving whilst disqualified; resisting police in the execution of their duty; and failing to submit to a breath analysis.  The judge imposed another aggregate sentence for these offences of 18 months.  He applied the same commencement date and so the applicant had the benefit of the sentence being wholly subsumed within the other sentence.  There is no need to refer to these offences, or the sentence, again.  What follows should be read as relating to the primary sentence.
Proposed grounds of appeal
6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence on grounds that assert that the judge erred in failing adequately to take into account pre-sentence custody and in failing to consider whether there were special circumstances in the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and his early pleas of guilty when setting the term of the non-parole period.
The offences
7All of the offences occurred in the period 30 March to 4 April 2011 and culminated with the applicant's arrest.  He has remained in custody since.  The offences of stealing from the person and aggravated robbery involved the theft of handbags from women.  The incident giving rise to the robbery was particularly serious in that the victim fell and was injured and there was evidence of significant and enduring physical and mental trauma.
Personal circumstances of the applicant
8A difficulty for the applicant on sentence was his criminal history.  He was aged 42 at the time of the offences.  He has a very lengthy record of offending going back to 1982.  He has committed a variety of offences but mainly ones involving dishonesty, including stealing, break, enter and steal, possessing housebreaking implements and armed robbery.  He had been released on parole in respect of a sentence for armed robbery some five months before the offending in question.  He had served a four year non-parole period and was in the course of serving a two year parole period.
9The applicant did not give evidence but a psychological report was tendered which set out his life history and the various difficulties he had encountered.  He is of Aboriginal heritage.  His father passed away when he was very young and his mother thereafter had a number of partners who were abusive and violent.  The applicant was assessed as possessing a reasonable level of intelligence but he has had a long-standing problem with substance abuse, primarily an addiction to heroin.
10A significant issue in the sentence proceedings related to the applicant's rehabilitation prospects.  It is clear, as the psychologist pointed out, that he requires substantial assistance in overcoming his substance abuse issues as well as with life management skills and vocational training.  He has spent so much of his teenage and adult life involved with drugs and in gaol that he has little employment history.  On the positive side he does have a supportive partner and mother, although the latter has succumbed to dementia.
11Another significant issue in the sentence proceedings was the fact that the applicant was serving the balance of the parole period from his previous sentence until 3 December 2012.  The State Parole Authority revoked his parole on 25 March 2011 because of a failure to comply with a reporting condition.  The applicant's solicitor successfully persuaded the judge to backdate the sentences to be imposed to the date that the pleas of guilty were entered, namely 23 July 2012.
Ground 1 - error relating to pre-sentence custody
12The applicant's argument in relation to the ground asserting that pre-sentence custody was not adequately taken into account amounts to this.  At one point of the sentence proceedings the judge was told, erroneously, that the applicant got out of gaol in October 2011 (rather than 2010).  It was contended that this led his Honour to think that the re-arrest 5 months later was in April 2012 (rather than April 2011).  Backdating the sentence to July 2012 must have involved the judge considering that a period of accumulation of about 3 months was appropriate.  But, in fact, the period of accumulation on the period of balance of parole was in the order of 15 months.  So, the judge was inadvertently misled and this did not enable him to properly exercise his discretion as to when to specify the commencement of the sentences. 
13There is no merit in this argument.  It is clear that the judge was aware of the correct position because he specifically mentioned in his sentencing remarks that the applicant had been released from gaol in October 2010 and that the offences were committed between 30 March and 4 April 2011.
14Moreover, there can hardly be complaint about the judge backdating the sentence to 23 July 2012 because that was the date suggested by the applicant's solicitor.  And the judge was clearly aware that this involved a period of accumulation of the order of 15 months because he said as much during the course of submissions.
Ground 2 - error in relation to special circumstances
15The applicant's argument in relation to the other ground is that there was material that would support a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2B) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for reducing the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  The matters relied upon were the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and his early pleas of guilty.
16Both of these matters were taken into account by the judge.  His sentencing remarks were succinct but a significant proportion of them were devoted to matters relevant to rehabilitation.  He indicated that he had been persuaded that his initial view that ""there is absolutely no realistic hope of his rehabilitation"" was too harsh.  He made recommendations that the applicant be considered for inclusion in drug rehabilitation and vocational training programs whilst in custody. 
17The pleas of guilty were not particularly early; they were entered in the District Court after committal for trial.  But the judge recognised their utilitarian value by allowing a quantified reduction of sentence.  It would have been double counting to take them into account again by reducing the non-parole period:  R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18] per Spigelman CJ. 
18The judge did make a finding of special circumstances, one can infer, on the basis that the sentence was to be partially accumulated upon a portion of the balance of parole the applicant was serving.  He indicated that he was minded to do this during an exchange with the applicant's solicitor.  The actual sentence imposed involved a non-parole component (4 years) that was two-thirds of the head sentence (6 years).  But when regard is had to the partial accumulation, it can be seen that the total effective custodial imposition to which the applicant is presently subject is in the order of 7 years 3 months with 5 years 3 months to be served before parole eligibility.  The minimum custodial component is about 73 per cent of the total term.  That is consistent with what the judge said that he intended in the course of the submissions by the applicant's solicitor on the question of finding special circumstances because of accumulation:  ""I can't see in principle anything wrong with the 75% ratio in his case"".
Conclusion
19The approach to the sentencing exercise in both respects with which the proposed grounds are concerned was well open to in the proper exercise of the judge's discretion.
20The two proposed grounds of appeal are devoid of any merit.
21Leave to appeal should be refused.
22BELLEW J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

2762465,R v Chahoud [2013] NSWDC 228,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 30 December 2011, Joseph Chahoud was acting as a drug courier, assisting someone else in the supply of a substantial quantity of cocaine. Fortunately, he drew attention to himself by driving too fast. Police stopped him for speeding offence. They discovered that he was already on bail for a traffic offence and that what he had just done represented a breach of that bail. They then noticed that he had a large sum of cash with him. For obvious reasons therefore they decided to search the car he was driving. They discovered twenty-five small, resealable plastic bags, each containing white powder. That turned out to be a total of 15 grams of cocaine with a purity of 37%. It was those drugs that the offender was involved with to the extent that he has now admitted that he was knowingly concerned in their supply.

2I should mention that there was a female passenger in the motor vehicle who was allowed to leave. It does not matter, but my suspicions are that she may have had some involvement in the offence as well.

3I say that the offender was acting as a courier because that circumstance was conceded by the Crown. There is no evidence one way or the other as to the extent of the offender's role, but I will act upon the concession by the Crown, it clearly being a considered one.

4Originally the offender was charged and committed for trial on an charge of supplying a prohibited drug. He was arraigned on that charge and pleaded not guilty, but on the morning his trial was due to commence he pleaded guilty to being knowingly concerned in the supply of the drug. Mr Turnbull, who appears for the offender today, concedes that that was a late plea of guilty. Nevertheless, it had a utilitarian benefit which must be reflected in the sentence I impose upon him, it being one of a number of factors which has persuaded me to defer passing sentence on Mr Chahoud at this stage for reasons I will indicate in a short while.

5The offender is now twenty-nine years of age. He was born in Australia to parents who had migrated from Lebanon. He is the eldest in a family of two brothers and two sisters. His father was a taxi driver and the family was close. After the offender completed year 12, he began a carpentry and joinery apprenticeship and finished that. He then began to do a builder's licence course but gave that up in favour of driving his father's taxi on the afternoon shift. 

6He met a young lady of about his age of Greek Cypriot background. They formed a relationship. Things have not been plain sailing because of the offender's drug use. At times the relationship ended because of understandable concerns about what the offender was doing by consuming cocaine excessively, and indeed they were not in a relationship on the day that this offence was committed. Their relationship has now resumed, but I have to say that Ms Polyviou seems to have a fairly realistic attitude towards staying with the offender if he uses drugs in the future.

7She became aware that he was using drugs after becoming concerned about his behaviour. Previously, when his shift ended at 3 in the morning, he would go home, have a sleep, and they would spend the day together before he started driving again in the afternoon. But things changed. At the end of his shift he began to go out, would come home, go to sleep and wake up just in time to go to work. She discovered that he was using Xanax. She did a bit of work on the internet and discovered that Xanax is often used by cocaine users to bring them down after consuming the drug. She confronted the offender and he eventually admitted that he was a user of drugs.

8The evidence would tend to suggest that he has recently given up drugs completely, perhaps around the middle of this year. There are clean urinalysis reports, so I am prepared to accept at least the high probability that the offender has given up his use of cocaine, but there remains some doubt as to how he will go in the future. He has been accepted into the In-Patient Drug and Alcohol Program at the St John of God Hospital. He is on a waiting list for admission to that program. He is seeing Dr Jacmon, a psychologist, and that is apparently beneficial. 

9I should say something about Dr Jacmon. I have in the past been very critical of his reports and nothing I have read in the report tendered today causes me to alter my opinion. His reports suffer from two particular defects. One is that they are virtually identical and almost every report of his I have ever read suggests that ""the offender's actions which led to offending indicated markedly diminished capacity for judgment because there appeared to be little thought given to the consequences"". The second problem with Dr Jacmon's report is that there is little or no explanation as to how he has drawn conclusions. For example, in this report he says that the offender's clinically significant major depressive disorder is likely to have arisen as a result of cocaine use from 2009. There just appears to be little explanation as to how Dr Jacmon was able to date when the disorder was likely to have arisen. 

10I should say that I drew these matters to the attention of Mr Turnbull and the offender before commencing today's proceedings in the event that they considered I was not the appropriate person to sentence the offender. No application that I disqualify myself has been made. However, I wish to emphasise something. While I have been highly critical and continue to be highly critical of Dr Jacmon's abilities to assist the Court, or willingness to assist the Court, I am not critical at all of his ability to assist those people he treats I say that in the context of, as I have mentioned, the circumstance that he is treating the offender, and none of my criticisms of Dr Jacmon should be taken to reflect on his ability as a psychologist who treats others.

11The Crown appropriately drew my attention to those well-known authorities regarding sentencing in the case of drug traffickers. The principles are well known. If the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree then a full time custodial sentence is required unless there are exceptional circumstances demonstrated. That does not mean that a full time custodial sentence is inappropriate in the case of a drug dealer who is not trafficking to a substantial degree. 

12In this case, whilst it is important to bear in mind that I am not interpreting legislation, I am not satisfied that he was trafficking to a substantial degree. The two particular features that have led me to draw that conclusion are that he was acting as a courier and that it was only on one occasion. Of course, pointing in the other direction is the number of separate packages that were found in his car but, despite that circumstance, I am satisfied that he was not trafficking to a substantial degree. Of course, that does not mean that ultimately he should not receive a full time custodial sentence. Much will depend on whether he is able to demonstrate, rather than just promise, that he has given up cocaine and that he is able to rehabilitate himself. 

13Primarily because his complete abstinence from cocaine is of fairly recent origin, I propose to adjourn this matter under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in order to better assess the offender's prospects for rehabilitation. In the event that he does what is required of him then it will be much less likely that a full time custodial sentence is imposed. If he fails to demonstrate rehabilitation then it will be clear that nothing less than a full time custodial sentence will be appropriate. To use a cliché, the ball is very much in Mr Chahoud's court. His future is in his own hands. 

14I will adjourn this matter until I was thinking 23 May next year at 2.00pm. 

15These are the conditions of bail in substitution for the current conditions of bail.



He is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service during the period of remand. 
As part of that supervision he is to undergo regular and random urinalysis. 
He is to use no illegal drugs whatsoever. 
He is not to use the drug Xanax unless that drug is prescribed to him. 
He is to pursue admission to the St John of God Drug and Alcohol InPatient Program and enter that program in the event that it is offered to him. 
If he has not done the program on the next occasion he is to provide evidence as to why that was the case. 
Unless he is an in-patient at the St John of God program he is to live at (an address known to the Court). 
He is to report to the Probation and Parole Service within seven days in order that they may commence supervising him.
 

ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 23 MAY 2014 AT 2PM FOR SENTENCE

		29 November 2013",2013-10-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762467,R v Brett STAAS (No 2) [2013] NSWDC 220,"Judgment


1Brett Staas was convicted and sentenced for supplying drugs. The Director of Public Prosecutions has brought against him proceedings for the confiscation of what the Director says are proceeds of crime. The Director is represented by Mr M L Barr as Crown Prosecutor.

2Mr Barr has tendered a document which I marked for identification 1. It is a psychologist's report. It was tendered on behalf of Mr Staas in his sentence proceedings. Mr Barr has tendered it in these proceedings because, he says, it contains assertions noted by the psychologist to have been made by Mr Staas. Those assertions are said by Mr Barr to be relevant and admissible in these confiscation proceedings. Mr B Neild, who appears for Mr Staas, objected to the tender of the report in these confiscation proceedings, even though he had relied of the same report in Mr Staas' sentencing proceedings. 

3Obviously, the form of the evidence is hearsay. Mr Barr argues that the psychologist's report is an admission by Mr Staas and therefore admissible as such under the Evidence Act 1995. In addition, he argues that the hearsay rule, which is contained in s 59 of the Evidence Act, does not apply because of s 68. The third limb of his argument turns on s 17 of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989: he argues that the psychologist's report is part of the transcript of the earlier proceedings.

4I will deal first with that last argument. Section 17 of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act says that if ""an application is made to a Court for a confiscation order in respect of a person's conviction of a serious offence, the Court may, in determining the application, have regard to the transcript of any proceedings against the person for the serious offence."" It is common ground between Mr Barr and Mr Neild that the sentence proceedings for Mr Staas were proceedings against him in respect of his conviction of a serious offence. The question at issue is whether the psychologist's report, which was admitted as an exhibit in the sentence proceedings, can be said to be part of ""the transcript"" of those proceedings. 

5Mr Neild says that the word ""transcript"" should be given its ordinary meaning, namely, copy of oral evidence given in Court. But Mr Barr said it must be given a broader meaning and encompass the whole of the material referred to in the transcript, which would pick up the exhibit. He pointed out that an exhibit such as the psychologist's report may be read out to a jury, but not necessarily transcribed. 

6For two reasons I reject Mr Barr's argument that the psychologist's report can be regarded as part of the transcript of the proceedings. The first reason relates to the meaning of the word ""transcript"". With the agreement of counsel, my associate provided me over the adjournment with definitions of that word from two online sources. One is The Oxford English Dictionary which defines transcript as a ""written copy"". It may also be a ""printed reproduction of this"". The Macquarie Dictionary defines, in its online version, transcript as ""something transcribed or made by transcribing; a written copy"". A secondary definition is, ""a reproduction in writing or print"". Interestingly, a fourth level definition, with particular reference to law, is ""an official written copy of proceedings in a Court"". To my mind, those definitions make it clear that the ordinary meaning of ""transcript"" is something which is heard and then rendered into writing, so that it represents a written copy of what the transcriber heard. That is not the same as an exhibit, be it a photograph, a physical item or a document referred to in the proceedings which are being transcribed. In addition, I put some weight on The Macquarie Dictionary definition by specific reference to law as ""an official written copy of proceedings in a Court"".

7The second reason for my rejection of the argument is that s 17 refers to ""a person's conviction of a serious offence"". The meaning of ""conviction of a serious offence"" is set out in s 5 of the same Act, which provides for the circumstances which shall be taken to mean that a person has been convicted of a serious offence. They include the circumstance that a person has been ""convicted, whether summarily or on indictment, of the offence by a Court"" and that the person ""has been charged with the offence and the Court hearing the charge has made an order"" under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and that the person has been sentenced for another offence, but the Court has taken into account the offence in question. That suggests that the purpose of having regard to the transcript, which s 17 provides for, may be to ascertain whether any of those circumstances referred to in s 5 exist or not. For those reasons, in my opinion, the psychologist's report is not part of the transcript of the sentence proceedings in respect of Mr Staas. 

8Turning to Mr Barr's other arguments, one of them relies on s 82 of the Evidence Act. I should point out that that provision is contained in Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act, which deals with admissions. Its preceding section, s 81, relevantly provides that the ""hearsay rule"" does ""not apply to evidence of an admission"". Interestingly, s 82 goes on to provide that s 81 ""does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission"" unless ""it is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made"" or ""it is a document in which the admission is made"". 

9It is common ground that there is no evidence being given by a person who heard Mr Staas saying what is contained in the psychologist's report. In other words, the psychologist has not been called to give evidence. 

10Mr Barr says that does not matter because the alternative is that the report is ""a document in which the admission is made"". 

11Mr Neild responds to that by saying that the assertions contained in the document which Mr Barr relies upon are irrelevant. He says all that is asserted is that the author of the psychologist's report heard Mr Staas make the assertions which the Crown seeks to rely upon. Mr Neild argues that that fact, namely, that the words were said, is not relevant. What would be relevant would be direct evidence from a person in the witness box saying that they heard Mr Staas saying those words. Mr Neild says that the psychologist's report faces the same problem as the evidence sought to be tendered but rejected by the High Court in Lee v R [1988] HCA 60; (1998) 195 CLR 594; (1998) 102 A Crim R 289 and which was also the subject of discussion in Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60, (2006) 160 A Crim R 195. Tendering the document alone, says Mr Neild, is second hand hearsay. It proves no more than the fact that the words were said. It does not prove the truth of the words. The psychologist cannot be reasonably supposed to have intended to assert, as a matter of truth, what she recorded Ms Staas as saying. Had she been called to give evidence in person, then that would have been a different matter. She would have given direct evidence of what she heard Mr Staas say, and that would, it seems to me, amount to an admission. But that is not the case.

12In Vickers, Simpson J (with the agreement of James and Hall JJ) referred at 208 ([64]) to what the High Court had said in Lee about the Evidence Act and ""the inherent unreliability of second-hand hearsay, affected as it is by the honesty and accuracy of the recollections of the person who is said to have heard, seen or otherwise perceived the making of the original representation, but who does not himself, or herself, actually give evidence."" Her Honour went on to say that if the witness's previous representations in the case being determined by her Honour ""as to what he heard the appellant say were to be admitted, there was no way that his honesty or accuracy could be tested or could be evaluated by the jury."" That was because, like here, that witness was not called. 

13To my mind, s 82's reference to ""a document"" should be interpreted consistently with the High Court's observations about the purpose of the hearsay provisions in the Evidence Act. The document should be a document authored by the person against whom the admission is sought to be tendered. That is consistent with the provision in s 82(a) that the alternative is evidence of the admission being given by a person who perceived it being made. It is also consistent with the wording of the section which provides that the admission ""is a document"". It seems to suggest that the document itself should be the admission, which is consistent with my opinion that the author of that document should be the person against whom the admission is tendered. In my opinion s 82 does not assist Mr Barr and the report is not admissible under that section. 

14Mr Barr goes on to argue that the assertions in the report of the psychologist about what Mr Staas said are assertions made by the psychologist on the authority of Mr Staas. He relies on s 87 of the Evidence Act. 

15To my mind the answer to that question is the point argued by Mr Neild that the document here in question - the psychologist's report - does not contain any relevant admission. It is an assertion made by the psychologist around 13 December 2011, which is the date of the report, of the psychologist's then recollection of what Mr Staas told her when she interviewed him in her office on 6 December 2011. It is no more than an assertion of the psychologist's recollection of the words that Mr Staas said. It is, as Mr Neild says, second hand hearsay. 

16Were the psychologist called to give evidence and gave evidence in the witness box of what she heard Mr Staas say, and evidence of what she heard him say amounted to an admission, then they could be admissions. In other words, I do not think the document contains admissions. 

17Were the document authored by Mr Staas it would contain admissions. Were the psychologist called and, even refreshing her memory from her report, gave an account of what she heard Mr Staas say, then that evidence would be capable of amounting to admissions by Mr Staas. 

18Finally, I think Mr Barr's reliance on s 68 of the Evidence Act fails for the same reason, that it is a provision about first hand hearsay rather than second hand hearsay, which this is. 

19To some it may appear that this decision represents a highly technical relief provided to a person who has clearly said things which are relevant and admissible against him. There is some force in that opinion. But the problem is in the form in which the evidence is tendered. It is, as the layman would understand it, hearsay upon hearsay. Had the psychologist herself been called then there would be no problem. The law regards it as important that if something that somebody has said against their own interests is to be admitted in evidence against them, that then there be reliable proof that they said those things. The reliability of that proof needs to be able to be tested. The person who claims to have heard what was said should be examined and cross examined in the witness box. That is the real problem here. The tender of a report by the psychologist deprives the person against whom the material is being tendered, namely Mr Staas in this case, from testing the reliability of what the author of the document says that she heard. 

20That is the real problem with the evidence and why I reject the tender of MFI 1.

2762468,Bin Radimin v R; Bin Zakhria v R [2013] NSWCCA 220,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offences and sentences
Each of the applicants was charged that they ""facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of at least five persons, namely a group of 23 persons, who were non-citizens and who have or had no lawful right to come to Australia and they each did so reckless as to whether the said 23 persons had, or have, a lawful right to come to Australia"" contrary to s233C of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act).

2On 12 April 2012 the trial commenced before Charteris DCJ and on 15 May 2012 the jury returned verdicts of guilty. On 25 May 2012 his Honour sentenced Agus Bin Radimin to 5 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months and Sahdan Effendi Bin Zakhria to 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years.

3Both applicants seek leave to appeal from their conviction. The grounds for each appeal are in essence the same, but in relation to the first ground, worded differently.

4In the case of Agus Bin Radimin (Bin Radimin) the grounds are:

Ground 1: The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury in that the direction as to the accused's knowledge as to the ultimate destination of the voyage was not sufficient.

Ground 2: The trial miscarried as the summing up by the trial judge was unbalanced and unfair.

5In the case of Sahdan Effendi Bin Zakhria (Bin Zakhria) the grounds of appeal are:

Ground 1: The trial miscarried as the judge erred in failing to direct the jury it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:
(a) The accused intended that the five or more persons be brought to a destination that was a part of Australia; and
(b) That the accused knew the destination was part of Australia.

Ground 2: The trial miscarried as the summing up by the trial judge was unbalanced and unfair.

6Bin Radimin also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.

Ground 3: The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.

Bin Zakhria does not appeal against his sentence since this was the minimum period of imprisonment mandated by the Act (Karim & Ors v R [2013] NSWCCA 23).

Crown case and evidence at trial

7On 4 November 2010 HMAS Larrakia received notification that a vessel was beached on Browse Island and was tasked to respond. Browse Island is part of Australia and is located about 181 kms off the coast of Western Australia. The vessel received the identification name Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel (SIEV) 207.

8SIEV 207 was carrying 23 passengers. Twenty two were from Afghanistan and one was from Pakistan. There were two crew members (the applicants) who were Indonesian. The beached vessel was a wooden fishing vessel, about 15 to 20 metres in length. The only navigational equipment located was an army style handheld magnetic compass which was in the wheelhouse. No maps or GPS were located. There was no fishing equipment located.

9The Crown case was that the 23 passengers left at night from a remote beach on Lombok in two small vessels. After travelling in those small vessels for about an hour, they met a larger vessel which they boarded. This vessel had two or three Indonesian crew, who were not the applicants. This larger vessel travelled for about 24 hours and in the middle of the night, met SIEV 207.

10Only the applicants were on SIEV 207 when the passengers arrived. They were described in the evidence as the ""older man"" or ""the captain"" (Bin Radimin) and the ""younger man"" (Bin Zakhria). The two vessels were next to each other for about an hour. While passengers were transferring from the larger vessel to SIEV 207, the crews from the two vessels talked. 

11Seven of the passengers gave evidence. Each was a passenger intending to travel to Australia. Each of them had no lawful right to come to Australia. One of the passengers gave evidence that while the crews from the two vessels talked, he heard the words ""Australia"", ""International waters"" and ""federal police"". These words were said in English. 

12After about an hour SIEV 207 began travelling, although for the first day it was towed by the larger vessel. After the larger vessel departed, SIEV 207 travelled for four or five days and nights. Bin Radimin's major role was to steer and control SIEV 207. Bin Zakhria on occasions assisted him, but mainly prepared food and provided the passengers with water and tea. 

13After about four or five days, SIEV 207 got ""lost"". When Bin Radimin tried to change direction, Bin Zakhria said ""no"", used the words ""federal police"" and pointed to the sky. Bin Radimin said that when he tried to change direction, one of the passengers hit him with a torch.

14There was evidence from the passengers that each of the applicants was heard to use the word ""Australia"" on multiple occasions during the voyage. Bin Radimin was heard to say both ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Reef"". These words were said in English. 

15Eventually, after seeing some lights and heading towards them, SIEV 207 landed on the sand at Browse Island. 

16It was the Crown case that the evidence of these words and phrases spoken by the applicants, together with the circumstances of the voyage, including the absence of navigation equipment, gave rise to an inference that they had knowledge of the purpose of the voyage and therefore an intention to, by their acts, facilitate the bringing of the passengers to Australia.

The case for the applicants

17The case for both the applicants was that they did not know that they were going to Australia and did not intend to do so. Bin Radimin gave evidence, but Bin Zakhria did not.

18Bin Radimin's evidence was that he was born in East Java, spoke Javanese and Indonesian, but did not speak Indonesian well. He did not complete schooling beyond primary school. Before boarding the SIEV 207, he worked in various occupations including farming, fishing and labouring. He had not captained a boat before. He was offered a job at Benoa Beach ""taking people on a holiday"" and was paid five million Rupiah in advance. He said that he boarded a small boat that took him to a larger boat. He said that his role on the larger boat was to steer. He said that he took a course of 120 degrees towards the southeast and northeast.

19He denied any knowledge that SIEV 207 or the passengers were heading to Australia. He had never said any English words while on board SIEV 207. He had never been out of Indonesia previously. He had limited knowledge of geography. He did not have a passport or visa. He did not know he was coming to Australia.

20Bin Zakhria relied upon his Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) interview, which took place on Christmas Island on 14 November 2010. The interview was conducted with the aid of an Indonesian interpreter. No caution was administered, but he was told that the information was ""needed"" and that truthful answers were ""expected"".

21The effect of that interview was that he was born in 1992. He finished grade five at primary school. He worked as a labourer. His English was poor. He took the job because he needed work. He was told to take passengers to cruise around and see the sea around Bali for 10 days. If he knew the intention was to come to Australia, he would not have agreed. 

22He had been in Bali for one week when he was offered the job. He was paid 2.5 million Rupiah. He did not know why Australia was chosen as the destination. The person who paid him was on board when the passengers arrived, but he did not know his name. Until this job, he had not met Bin Radimin. He did not know where to go, but the passengers told ""us where to go"".

APPEAL
Ground 1: The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury in that the direction as to the accused's knowledge as to the ultimate destination of the voyage was not sufficient.

Ground 1: The trial miscarried as the judge erred in failing to direct the jury it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:
(a) The accused intended that the five or more persons be brought to a destination that was a part of Australia; and
(b) That the accused knew the destination was part of Australia.

23The offence of which the applicants were convicted arises under s233C of the Act. It provides:

""233C Aggravated Offence of People Smuggling (at least 5 people)

(1) A person (the first person) commits an offence if:

(a) the first person organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of at least 5 persons (the other persons); and

(b) at least 5 of the other persons are non-citizens; and

(c) the persons referred to in paragraph (b) who are non-citizens had, or have, no lawful right to come to Australia.

(2) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(b).

(3) If, on a trial for an offence against subsection (1), the trier of fact:

(a) is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of that offence; and

(b) is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant 
is guilty of the offence of people smuggling;

the trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of an offence against subsection (1) but guilty of the offence of people smuggling, so long as the defendant has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt.""

24By way of further background, towards the end of the trial, an application was made by counsel for Bin Radimin for a specific direction to be given by the trial judge to the jury.

""DAVID: That is that I have a copy of Zahra DCJ's written directions at law which I have just marked the point where I would ask that that other direction be made, but the other matter is the issue as to whether or not the Crown must also prove not only that the intention was to bring them to an island but to bring them to Australia. I say in this case it's now become relevant, because the Crown's case is there is much reference to Ashmore Island, that therefore it enlivens the need for the prosecution to not only prove if they are suggesting that the accused were endeavouring to go to Ashmore Island that they must prove that the accused also knew that Ashmore Island was a part of Australia. I make that submission ..."" (AB 1048.36)

""DAVID: Yes it is intention and my submission is, and I think that the Crown would clearly agree, that if it meant to do something the accused must know, it's not just intent - it's not just simply the physical facilitation, there must be that mental element of knowledge to have had that intention. You can't intend something if you don't know it.

HIS HONOUR: If they intended to facilitate bringing the people to Australia and they did, where they hit on the continent is irrelevant. Is that -

DAVID: That's correct, your Honour, but for abundant caution, I am suggesting that because we have the issue raised that there's been lots of references to Ashmore Reef, and that the accused, or I speak for my client, but the references to the accused or to Ashmore Reef and that he's supposed to have known about Ashmore Reef, whether - it may well be the jury could reject all about that he knew anything about Australia, but they might think Ashmore Reef is quite a specific thing to say. I'm asking that -

HIS HONOUR: I'll hear submissions on that, I understand what you are saying to me."" (AB 1049.40)

25His Honour rejected that submission and said:

""HIS HONOUR: ... My comfortable view about the law is that a prosecution must prove that the accused intentionally facilitated the bringing to Australia of the group. The intention that has to be established by the prosecution is the intention to facilitate bringing them to Australia, no particular point in Australia. If the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he facilitated bringing them and intentionally did so, in that, he meant to bring the group to Australia, it doesn't matter whether he was intending to go to Ashmore Reef and ended up in Browse Island or ended up in Perth or ended up on Bondi Beach. That's the direction I'll be giving the jury if that assists. ..."" (AB 1268.46)

26In fact the direction which his Honour gave was:

""HIS HONOUR: So that first element, members of the jury, is that the accused facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of five or more people ... The other matter I tell you in relation to that essential element is that Browse Island is part of Australia. Browse Island is said in the evidence to be the name of the island which the boat eventually came into contact with. ... If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that first essential element that the accused facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of five or more people, you then consider the second element. You might think to yourself that the first element does not appear to be in issue, that there was a facilitation of the bringing of the people to Australia. But the second element that the accused did so intentionally has formed the basis of many submissions by the legal representatives for the accused. An accused does an act intentionally if he meant to do it. In this case the accused ""meant to do it"" if he knew he was facilitating bringing the people to Australia, that is, that it was his intention. It is necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused intended to facilitate the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of five or more people. ... The prosecution does not have to prove that the accused's intention was to facilitate the group to Browse Island. What the prosecution has to prove is that the accused's intention was to facilitate bringing the group to anywhere in Australia and in fact brought the group to Browse Island."" (SU 10-11, AB 1565-1566)

27Later in the summing up, his Honour explained to the jury how intention and knowledge could be proved:

""But intention or knowledge can be proved by having regard to the conduct of the person and the words uttered by the person in any conversation that was recorded. Seeking to prove the state of mind of the accused, the prosecution can put before you various circumstances, including evidence of acts and words of the accused. But if you find those acts occurred or words were spoken the prosecution can then invite you to draw an inference as to what the accused's intention was or what the accused's knowledge was. Under our system that is a permissible approach to prove the state of mind of an accused person.

...

What is permissible is to look at what the person was doing and saying at the time and permit you, the jury, to draw an inference as to what that person's intention was."" (SU 14-15, AB 1569-1570)

28The applicants submitted that the direction given by his Honour to the jury was correct insofar as it went, but that it was deficient in that it did not go far enough. The applicants submitted that given their alleged references (according to the passengers) to Ashmore Island, for the Crown to establish its case, it had to establish that they knew that Ashmore Reef or Ashmore Island was part of Australia.

29On behalf of Bin Zakhria, the submission was put in this way:

""The Crown case depended on proving either:

(a) The accused believed the passengers were bound for ""Australia"" (and therein facilitated their journey) and it did not matter where the boat ended up, or

(b) The accused believed the passengers were bound for Ashmore Island and that the accused knew that Ashmore Island was part of Australia, but happened to land at Browse Island.

In those circumstances the trial judge had correctly directed the jury in relation to the first proposition but not the second. His Honour had been asked to do so by counsel but had declined.""

30The same submission was put by the applicants in another way. They submitted that the words attributed to them of ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Island"" gave rise to two methods of proof: either belief that Australia was the destination or belief that Ashmore Island was the destination and that it was part of Australia. They submitted that it was open to the jury to use one and not the other to infer belief or knowledge and that it was open to the jury to reject reliance on the use of the word ""Australia"" (because of the lack of context). Instead, it was open to the jury to rely upon the use of the phrase ""Ashmore Island"" to infer belief as to the specific intended destination. They submitted that in that latter case, the jury should have been directed that it was necessary for the Crown to establish that the applicants knew that Ashmore Island was part of Australia.

31The applicants submitted that it was open to the jury to use the alleged use of the word ""Australia"" by them in one of two ways: Either to infer knowledge that Australia was the ultimate destination, or to infer knowledge that Ashmore Reef/Island was part of Australia. If it were the former - that they believed the ultimate destination of the passengers was Australia, irrespective of the use of the term ""Ashmore Island"", then the directions were sufficient. If it were the latter - and the jury did not know what to make of the alleged use of the word ""Australia"" by them, then the jury needed to be directed that they must be satisfied that, if they knew or believed the destination was Ashmore Island, they knew that Ashmore Island was part of Australia.

32The applicants noted that the trial judge did not have the benefit of the recent appellate decisions in PJ v R [2012] VSCA 146, Sunada v R; Jaru v R [2012] NSWCCA 187, Alomalu v R [2012] NSWCCA 255 and Zamudin v R [2013] NSWCCA 120.

33The applicants relied upon the observation of this Court (Macfarlan JA; Price and McCallum JJ) in Sunada v R: Jaru v R at [5]:

""5 In their grounds of appeal against conviction filed on 3 May 2012, the appellants contended that the trial judge's direction was erroneous. On 29 June 2012 the Victorian Supreme Court delivered judgment in PJ v R [2012] VSCA 146, holding that proof of an offence under s 233C of the Migration Act requires proof that the accused intended that relevant persons be brought to a destination that was a part of Australia and that the accused knew was a part of Australia"" (emphasis added).

34The applicants also relied upon the following statements from PJ v R (Maxwell P, Redlich and Hansen JJA):

""5 For reasons which follow, we would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. For the applicant to be found guilty of the offence under s 233C, he must be shown to have intended that the relevant persons be brought to Australia. That is, he must have been aware that Australia was the intended destination.""

""44 Unsurprisingly, this definition of ""no lawful right to come to Australia"" is concerned with - and only with - rights of entry into Australia. It follows, in our view, that by requiring proof of the defendant's recklessness as to the absence of that lawful right, Parliament intended to require proof that the accused was ""aware of a substantial risk"" that none of the relevant persons had a lawful right to come to Australia. That is, the defendant must have turned his mind to the existence of that risk, in relation to that particular country, and decided, unjustifiably, to take the risk. On this view, the word ""Australia"" when used in para (c) does not mean ""the intended destination of the voyage, provided that it is in fact part of Australia"". It means a place known to the accused as Australia.""(Emphasis added)

35The applicants also relied upon Alomalu v R. In that case the direction given by the trial judge was that the relevant intention would be proved if ""the accused knew that he was helping to take people to Australia"". McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Rothman and Adamson JJ agreed) said:

""82 To my mind his Honour's direction was not sufficient to effectively isolate the issue that the jury had to determine. ... Although it was correct to instruct the jury that they must be satisfied that the appellant knew that he was helping to take people to Australia, the issue in this case was whether, although he knew the boat was going to Ashmore Reef, he knew that Ashmore Reef was a part of Australia. The emphasis in both Sunada and PJ was on the accused knowing that the intended destination of the voyage was a place known to the accused as Australia. His Honour's direction did not achieve that objective."" (Emphasis added).

36On the basis of those statements of principle, the applicants submitted that the trial judge's direction to the jury was not sufficient. They submitted that given the evidence in the case, and the extensive references by passenger witnesses to their alleged use of the words ""Ashmore Reef/Island"" the direction by the trial judge needed to address the issue of the applicants having knowledge that Ashmore Reef/Island was part of Australia.

37The Crown challenged the applicants' submissions on two bases. The first was that the applicants' submissions depended upon a factual matrix which did not arise. The Crown submitted that its case never depended upon proving one of two alternative scenarios as suggested. It submitted that at all times its case was that the applicants' state of mind was that they intended to facilitate the bringing of the passengers to Australia. The Crown submitted that from a factual point of view, the first ground of appeal was not a live issue at trial.

38The Crown submitted that the evidence of the passengers to the effect that the applicants from time to time during the voyage used the words ""Australia"", ""Ashmore Reef"", ""International waters"" and ""federal police"" in the context in which those words were said, was compelling evidence as to their state of mind, i.e. that they intended to facilitate the bringing of the passengers to Australia. The Crown also noted that it was the applicants' case at trial that they did not at any time on the voyage use those words.

39The Crown submitted that if the jury accepted the evidence of the passengers (as they must have done), there was no basis to isolate, as the applicants sought to do on the appeal, the references to ""Ashmore Reef/Island"". The Crown submitted that there was no factual basis for the submission that the applicants may have intended to have facilitated a trip to Ashmore Reef/Island, but did not intend to facilitate the bringing of passengers to Australia. The Crown submitted that the fact that Ashmore Reef/Island was referred to, did not of itself give rise to a need for a direction of the kind suggested by the applicants, nor did it give rise to an alternative basis of liability for the Crown case. The Crown submitted that the context in which the words ""Ashmore Reef/Island"" were used was such that it was clear that the intent was to bring the passengers to Australia.

40The second basis on which the Crown challenged the applicants' submissions was that they were based on a wrong interpretation of the second element which needed to be established to make out an offence under s233C of the Act. The Crown submitted that to satisfy that second element, it was not necessary that the Crown prove ""that the accused intended that relevant persons be brought to a particular destination and that the accused knew that was a part of Australia"". The Crown submitted that the correct statement of the second element was that set out in The Queen v Ahmad [2012] NTCCA 1; 256 FLR 423:

""2 The accused meant to facilitate the bringing of the passengers to Australia (fault element - intention).""

41The Crown noted that special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused in Ahmad on the basis that the Court was ""not persuaded that there is any reason to doubt the correctness of the order made by the Court of Criminal Appeal"" in relation to each of the proceedings sought to be appealed (Mahendra v The Queen; Ahmad v The Queen [2012] HCA Trans 249 at lines 486-488).

42The Crown submitted that such an approach was fully consistent with PJ, i.e., the intention of the applicants must relate to Australia. It followed that if an accused only intended to facilitate the bringing of passengers to some place which they did not know was Australia, he was not intending to facilitate the bringing to Australia of the passengers. That element as a matter of fact would not be satisfied. The Crown submitted that PJ did not create a different or additional element. It submitted that there could only be one fault element for each physical element and in this case the fault element was intention.

43The Crown submitted that PJ needed to be read in its proper context and if so read, was not authority for the proposition that for the necessary intention to be demonstrated under s233C(1)(a), the Crown must prove that the accused intended to go to a particular destination and that the accused must know the destination to which they were travelling was part of Australia.

44On the particular facts of Sunada, Alomalu and Zamudin for the necessary intention to be demonstrated under s233C(1)(a), a two stage level of proof was required, i.e. that the applicants intended the relevant persons to be brought to a destination and that the applicants knew that the destination was a part of Australia. That was because the evidence in those cases was to the effect that the accused intended to take the relevant persons to a particular destination, i.e. Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island. The Crown submitted that the effect of the evidence in this case was not that the applicants intended that the passengers be brought to a particular destination, but that they intended, in a general sense, that the passengers be brought to Australia.

45In order to resolve that issue, it is necessary to examine more closely the relevant evidence of the passengers concerning what was said and done by the applicants.

Evidence of the passengers

46Only four of the seven passengers gave evidence relevant to this issue. MAG said that he only spoke with the ""Indonesian crew"" on the ""last days"". He said that he communicated with the older man, who told him that he had lost his way. This evidence was given:

""After the - the older guy said we lost and he tried to turn the steering wheel in different direction, but I saw the younger crew member told him ""no, no, no don't do that"". I understood he was saying this is the Australian water and the police was come. So I - he make him to stop, not to turn the boat back."" (AB 360.23)

47Later it was established that MAG had said ""federal police"" in English in that answer (AB 361.35). Under cross-examination MAG confirmed that he had heard the word ""lost"" used by Bin Radimin in English (AB 390.26, .41, .48).

48In cross-examination MAG said:

""Q. Of course, the conversation we're talking about, that we're referring to, is a conversation in which you say the older crewman of the Indonesian crewmen said something about being lost and the younger of the crewmen said something apparently in reply to that. This is the conversation we're talking about isn't it?
A. Yes. When the older guy said ""Look we lost"" and he tried to turn the steering wheel and the younger crew member said ""no, no, no federal police so don't turn"".

HIS HONOUR: Q: Said ""no, no, no"" what was the rest of the answer about federal police? Said ""no, no, no"".
A. No, no, no. Federal police"" pointed above.

Q. Federal police and pointed above?
WITNESS: Yeah.

COUNSEL: Q: When you say that pointed above are you saying it's this younger crewman, the younger of the Indonesian crewmen who pointed above did he?
A. Yeah, he pointed above the air and he said ""federal police is coming""."" (AB 399.8)

""Q. ... You tell us this morning that you saw the younger crewman pointing up in the air at the time he was saying these words. Is that right?
A. Yes when he was trying to turn the steering wheel and he just pointed above and he said ""federal police coming. That's why we understood""."" (AB 399.46)

49SMD said that he could not speak the crew's language. His evidence relevantly was:

""Q. ... Did you ever have any discussion with the older crew member about what you believed the intended destination of Australia was for the voyage? Did you ever discuss that with the older crew member?
A. Myself, I didn't discuss this much or I didn't talk about this matter with him but I heard other boys, they were talking about a destination or going to Australia with him. I heard that."" (AB 455.7)

""Q. ... Mr D, we left off on Friday. I wanted to ask you a question. Did you ever hear any person on the boat use the word or say the word ""Australia"" during the whole journey on the boat?
A. Yes, yes.

Q. So are you saying yes you did hear somebody say the word ""Australia"" on the boat?
A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us who you heard using or saying the word ""Australia""?
A. Yes I heard this from both the crews. And especially from the younger one and while we were there on the boat a group of us were sitting there and the young one was saying that after I spent my sentence, after I get arrested and spend my sentence then I will go back to Indonesia and the money that I'm getting from this journey, I will use it to get married ...

Q. Did you hear anyone else say the word ""Australia""?
A. Yes and especially after a few days, after three days, that we got lost in the water and other people who were pointing out, like in the sign language, asking and pointing to the clock, to their wrist watch, and saying that where is Australia, what's happening, and you said that you would get us to Australia in about three days and what's happening, where is Australia.

Q. So are you saying that the passengers were saying this?
A. The passengers were speaking to the crew and questioning them when they would get to Australia.

Q. Did you ever hear the older man say the word ""Australia"" himself?
A. Yes.

Q. Was it on one occasion or more than one occasion?
A. On multiple occasions ...

Q. Was that from the - near the beginning of the time that you first boarded the boat or was it at a particular time through the journey, or was it throughout the journey?
A. We were speaking, actually we were speaking and also the other people were speaking the word ""Australia"" from the time we got on board saying that how is the people of Australia and how the flag of Australia look like and all about matters related to Australia were the focus of the conversations. 

...

Q. My question if I wasn't clear Mr D, was I'm only talking about this last boat, the last boat that you were on that came to Australia?
A. Yes I'm talking about this last boat, that these two people are the crew.

Q. Thank you. You have made mention a little while ago about some money I think you said being paid or a reference to money by the younger man. Did you hear him say anything about the amount of money?
A. He was doing his hand like this but once I finish my sentence I would go to prison for one year, after that I would go and get married for this money, but he did not mention about the sum of money.

Q. You mentioned that he did his hand like this, I think. Can you describe how he did his hand, how he moved his hand?
A. He said like he - he - he crossed his hands like this, then he pointed with the index finger one, and this finger, saying that one meaning one year, and at the same time he was showing his finger around the ring saying that he would get married."" (AB 492.6 - AB 493.45)

50In cross-examination, he said:

""Q. So when you said this morning that the older man was actually or said the word ""Australia"" would you agree that he, in fact, just was using gestures?
A. If he in relation to the nouns, it's very common everywhere Australia - the name of Australia is understood and he said the word ""Australia"" but when it comes to how many days, he would gesture by hands - by fingers."" (AB 517.48 - 518.3)

""Q. What I'm saying to you is you were asked a lot of times, ""Did the crew talk about Australia"" weren't you?
A. Yes and I have replied that many times we were gesturing and responding about Australia.

Q. Yes, there was a lot of times where you were gesturing and talking about Australia to passengers. That's correct, isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. But you did not in your statement or telephone note, say anything about Australia, about the older person going to Australia, sorry using the word ""Australia""?
A. No, I just said my solicitor that this person, the older man, was talking about Australia and gesturing about Australia.

Q. The older man. I'm suggesting to you that you - that this is what you said about the older man with Australia. Sorry, just excuse me. You see I am suggesting that you did not say anything at all about the older man using the word ""Australia""?
A. No, no I have said it."" (AB 539.43 - 540.11)

51HAA gave evidence. He said:

""Q. Mr A, did you ever hear the word ""Australia"" used on the boat during the five days and five nights you were on the boat?
A. Yes I did. ...

Q. Who did you hear say the word ""Australia""?
A. I heard once from the captain mouth, that he said Australia.

Q. Did he say or do anything else when he said the word ""Australia""?
A. He was saying that Ashmore Reef.

Q. Did you hear him say those words, is that what you are saying?
A. I heard the words ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Reef"" from him."" (AB 660.15)

""Q. Are you able to say at what point during the five days and five nights you were on that boat you heard the captain say ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. On the fifth day he pronounced the word ""Ashmore Reef"" and ""Australia"" and then we asked the - that Afghan passenger, what he was talking about."" (AB 663.9)

52Under cross-examination HAA said:

""Q. You told us earlier today that the older person had used the words ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. Yes.

Q. And that he also used the word ""Australia""?
A. Yes.

Q. You heard a lot of the passengers talking about Ashmore Reef didn't you through the course of the trip?
A. No, not much. ...

Q. Not much? What did you hear from the other passengers?
A. Not much.

Q. Did you hear them say ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. At that point of time in relation to Ashmore Reef when this man, specifically this man, when he said that ""Ashmore Reef"" then I asked from that Afghan who was speaking Indonesian language - I asked what is he talking about Ashmore Reef.

Q. Can you answer yes or no. Did you hear passengers utter words: ""Australia"" or ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. No.

Q. Never is that what your evidence is here today, is it?
A. No.

Q. So just to be clear that you never heard them say ""Ashmore Reef"" is that what you're telling us in court today?
A. No.

...

Q. So is what you're saying is that the only person who ever said ""Ashmore Reef"" or ""Australia"" was the older person?
A. Yes.

Q. So you never discussed this with any of the passengers on the way?
A. I just said before, you know, that this word, I asked about this word, which was pronounced before from the Afghan man who would know Indonesian and he explained it to me ...

Q. Would you agree then that you did hear the word ""Ashmore Reef"" from that Afghan man, those words from the Afghan man?
A. When I asked him the question.

Q. So now it's your evidence here today is it that as a result of you hearing it from the older man the term ""Ashmore Reef"", you then asked someone else?
A. Yes."" (AB 689.48 - 691.47)

""Q. Now you told us this morning that you didn't hear any of the passengers talking about Ashmore Reef didn't you?
A. No I did not.

Q. So you did not hear them talk about Ashmore Reef, is that correct?
A. Not until that captain pronounced the word ""Ashmore Reef"" then after that I asked from that Afghan man who knew Indonesian then he said Ashmore Reef.

Q. Because I want to say to you that do you recall in your statement then some people were asking when we would arrive at Ashmore Reef. Do you recall saying that?
A. The passengers you mean?

Q. Yes. 
A. I hadn't heard it myself but if for example I had said it, that was one year and a half ago. I don't remember.""

""Q. I want to see whether you recall saying this: ""Some people were asking when we would arrive at Ashmore Reef"" then: ""The passengers said the word ""Ashmore Reef"" to the crew and used fingers to point?
A. Maybe I have said it.

Q. Do you agree that that was correct at the time that that is correct?
A. That's possible yes.

...

Q. You also said this do you recall saying this to the officer when you made the statement: ""We asked the crew why don't you take us to Ashmore Reef. The crew said they were instructed by a person in Indonesia to take us somewhere else.""
A. Yes I have said that.

Q. That was the case wasn't it, the crew never suggested to the passengers to go to Ashmore Reef at all did they?
A. You mean these two people?

Q. I speak for the older person. I will rephrase that question. The older person never said at any stage that - sorry I withdraw that. You've heard from the passengers, didn't you, that in fact the crew didn't want to take you to Ashmore Reef?
A. Yes.

Q. It was the passengers who were the ones that were - I would suggest to you it was the passengers were the only ones that used the words ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. I had heard it from that man who knew the language but overall I was suffering from seasick and I was asleep.

Q. So could it be fair to say that you were really relying on what the other man told you and not what you heard?
A. If the statement which I given a year ago or something, I have forgotten many events."" (AB 698.26)

""Q. Looking back on this matter Mr A, could it be the case that in fact you were mistaken and that it was the fact that other people were using the words ""Ashmore Reef"" that made you think that the captain knew something about Ashmore Reef and used those words?
A. No the captain a hundred percent I'm sure that he pronounced and said the words ""Ashmore Reef"".

Q. You said also here today that you heard the person you refer to as the captain use the word ""Australia""?
A. Yes.

Q. But you didn't say that in your statement did you?
A. Whatever had been asked in relation to that statement I answered to that effect. Whatever hadn't been asked so I didn't respond to that effect."" (AB 699.26)

""Q. Because I'm suggesting that in fact one of the passengers hit him over the head?
A. I did not see. 

...

Q. Scared of his predicament, scared of the passengers?
A. No that was not true that as soon as he turned the boat around the younger man said ""look Australia police"".

Q. See I'm suggesting that that just did not happen and it was the passengers who made the older man turn the boat around?
A. No, that's not true because when we were talking, they were liaising about this dialogue whether to return or go to Australian destination."" (AB 705.31 - 706.8)

""Q. That when it became apparent to the passengers that the older man was lost, there was some lively discussion between or among the passengers over whether the boat should continue or the boat should turn back. That's correct, isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. is it during this period, this time, that you say the older man said the word or the words ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore"". Is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. Now at that time when the older man appeared worried and, you say, said the words ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore"" or ""Ashmore Reef"" where do you recall, or if you can tell us, where do you recall the younger man or the younger Indonesian man?
A. At that point of time when the elder man pronounced the word ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Reef"" the younger one was standing in the end of the boat, we were there on the top of the roof."" (AB 735.8)

""Q. But you also told us yesterday that this younger man, as this was going on, did not say anything. That's what you told us wasn't it?
A. You know everything did not happen in a split of a second but we turned around and the younger man, Indonesian young man, said ""Australian police"".

Q. ... So you tell us, do you, that at the time that this younger man was waving and pointing that he also said some words which you recognised containing the words ""Australia police"" is that right or ""Australian police""?
A. No I clearly stated yesterday and you did not let me elaborate on it then you - you continued.

Q. No I'm not asking you that Mr A. Are you telling us now - are you telling us now - that when the older man changed the direction of the boat that the younger man was standing at the back of the boat and that he waved and pointed and that at that time he said some words which included words that you heard as ""Australia"" or ""Australian police"". Is that what you tell us now?
A. Yes he was waving and pointing towards the sky giving the impression that the Australian police is coming and we should not return.

Q. ... You see all you understood Mr A, wasn't - all you heard and all you understood - were words in the language you thought might be Indonesian, which included words you understood which included ""Australia"" or ""Australian police"". That's right isn't it?
A. The first time he said ""Australian police"", second time he said ""federal police"". First time I heard him federal police, the word federal I heard from him."" (AB 736.1)

""Q. That there was this discussion between the passengers about whether to turn back or to continue; that's right isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. And this is also the time you tell us that you heard - you say you heard the older man say the words ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Reef"", that's right isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. And throughout all this time the younger man was standing at the back end of the boat, that's right isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. And that when the younger was standing at the back of the boat he said some words in a language you did not understand, waved with his hands and pointed; that's right isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. And it was at that time you say the younger man said words to the effect of in English, or that you recognised as ""Australian police"" and you also heard him say ""federal police""?
A. Yes."" (AB 736.49 - 737.19)

53The only other passenger to give evidence on this issue was AR. He said that at the time the passengers transferred from the larger boat onto SIEV 207, he heard a conversation between the Indonesian crew members on both boats.

""Q. Did you see the crew members from the second boat speaking to the crew members from the third boat at this point in time?
A. Yes.

Q. Could you understand anything that was being said between the two crews or not at all?
A. No those two crewmen were speaking to the other two crewmen and one of the crewmen of the second big ship was talking to them through one of the passengers who was my friend and who knew some of the language.

Q. What I was asking you was whether when the two crews were speaking, were there any words that they were saying that you could understand?
A. Yes I understood when they said ""international waters""; I understood that. And also when they were using the word ""Australia"", I was under impression that they were speaking as to Australia."" (AB 794.32)

""Q. Mr R you were saying that this was a conversation or a communication that was happening when all four crew members, the two crew members from the second boat and the two crew members from the third boat and you and others were present together. Is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. You said earlier in your evidence that they said the words 'international waters"" and ""Australia"". Do you recall that was what you said earlier?
A. Yes. (AB 749.49)

...

Q. At the time this communication's happening on the boat, at the time of transfer of the passengers, at that point in time, what did you see or hear the crew members from the third boat say or do, what did you see them say or do?
A. I heard that they said they would take us to Australia and after some time they would get us to Ashmore Reef."" (AB 795.49 - 796.32)

""Q. At this time when this conversation is happening about international waters or Australia, did you see whether or not the crew members from the third boat said anything? Were they talking to the other crew members or not, or were they just standing quietly?
A. Yes in their own language.

...

Q. Yes, so the third large boat has come next to the second large boat. All the passengers have transferred onto the third boat and you said that there was a communication about international waters and Australia. I'm asking what happened next, what else happened?
A. They said Australian police will take you."" (AB 798.50 - 799.46)

""Q. On the journey of five days and five nights in the boat did you at any stage hear either of the Indonesian crewmen say the word ""Australia""?
A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to say which of the two Indonesian crew members you heard say the word ""Australia""?
A. I heard from both of them but I don't know how many times.

Q. Over the journey of five days and five nights on that boat, did you at any stage hear either of the two Indonesian crew members say the words ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to say which of the two crew members you heard say the words ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. Both of them.

Q. Are you able to say at which stage of the voyage over that five days and five nights?
A. I don't remember the stage at what stage they said it.

Q. Are you able to say whether it was just once or more than once?
A. Many times."" (AB 875.33 - 876.2)

""Q. If I could ask that the Crown agree that on the last page of those notes, that the notes reflect ""I can't remember if captain said Ashmore but heard other passengers ask captain about Ashmore Reef. Remembers captain holding up ten fingers"". 

TRIAL ADVOCATE: That's what's recorded on the notes your Honour."" (AB 895.21)

54Under cross-examination AR said:
""Q. Along the way you had a number of conferences didn't you with the prosecution as we've discussed before?
A. Yes.

Q. You were asked, you agree, many times whether either of the crew used the words ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Reef""?
A. Yes.

...

Q. Well I am suggesting to you that there was a lot of focus on it, wasn't there?
A. Yes.

Q. I'm suggesting that you have in fact changed your version at times along the way?
A. Just give me an example, for example.

Q. I'm suggesting that at that some stages you have said that the older man has said ""Ashmore Reef"" and/or ""Australia"" and at other times you have expressed doubt about what he said?
A. I have said it before and I'm telling you right now that I'm positive that they pronounced those words."" (AB 903.9)

55AR was referred to the occasion when the passengers were transferring to SIEV 207 when a conversation took place between the two Indonesian crews. AR maintained that certain words were used in the conversation between the crew members:

""Q. Mr R you're telling us are you, that in this conversation involving one or more of the crew from the second boat, the second large boat, the boat that took you to Australia, was conducted in a language that you did not understand, other than two words ""international waters"". Is that what you're saying to us?
A. Yes. No there - no there were three words. One was ""international water"", the second was ""federal police"" and the third was ""Australia"". (AB 917.35)

""Q. ... Nevertheless Mr R you tell us in court today do you that you have a quite distinct recollection of hearing one of these crew members, or use the words or say the words in English ""international waters""? Is that what you tell us?
A. I'm not sure about my memory but I am positive that he said ""international waters""."" (AB 920.19)

56In re-examination AR said:

""Q. And then you were further asked about when you had heard the word ""Australia"" and you said that you were transferring from the second boat to the third boat initially and you said ""when we transferred to the third boat the crewmen of the second boat pointed to the crewmen of the third boat and said ""these people are taking you to Australia"" and these people pointed fingers at their chests and said ""we are taking you to Australia"". Do you remember giving that evidence?
A. Yes.

Q. Who were the people that you were saying were pointing their fingers at their chest and saying ""we are taking you to Australia""?
A. The elder man."" (AB 1019.30)

57As can be seen from the above extracts of evidence, but which was more obvious in cross-examination on other issues and in counsel's submissions at trial, the credibility of these witnesses was seriously challenged. Discrepancies between their oral evidence and what they had said in statements was highlighted. The limitations of the above evidence was also stressed, i.e., that the passengers did not speak Indonesian and that communication took place by the use of a few English words and gestures. The limitations of this evidence was again stressed in proceedings in this Court.

58There is no ground of appeal to the effect that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. Accordingly, despite the imperfections in the evidence identified by counsel, the effect of the extracts of evidence set out above has to be assessed on the basis that it was accepted by the jury. The issue is whether that evidence gave rise to the problems identified in Sunada, Alomalu and Zamudin.

59What is clear from the extracts of evidence is that the references to Ashmore Reef/Island (which came from only two of the four passengers) were largely incidental and in context were used with other words such as ""Australia"". The preponderance of evidence was to the effect that the applicants were heard to use the word ""Australia"" and other expressions such as ""federal police"" in a context which allowed the jury, if it accepted that evidence, to conclude that the applicants intended to facilitate the coming to Australia of the passengers. In that regard, the characterisation of the evidence of these witnesses by the Crown should be accepted.

60This was not a case like Alomalu where the Crown conceded ""there is no evidence that the appellant was told or otherwise had knowledge that Ashmore Island was part of Australia. That is as high as I can put it."" As McClellan CJ at CL said in that case:

""37 ... Accordingly, the most that can be established from the evidence is that the appellant was told that the passengers would be taken to Ashmore Reef. As was conceded by the Crown there is no evidence to establish that the appellant knew that Ashmore Reef was a part of Australia.""

61In this case, there was the use of the word ""Australia"" on a number of occasions by the applicants which in context, together with other evidence, allowed the jury to conclude that the applicants intended to facilitate the coming to Australia of the passengers. The facts of this case accorded closely with those in Taru Ali v R [2013] NSWCCA 211. The reasoning of RA Hulme J at [60] - [62] is equally applicable to this case.

62On the facts of this case, the trial judge was not required to give the additional direction that it needed to be proved that the applicants knew Ashmore Reef/Island was part of Australia. The factual basis which would require the additional direction was not established by the evidence. It follows that the direction given by the trial judge was appropriate. In the case of each applicant, therefore, the first ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 2: The trial miscarried as the summing up by the trial judge was unbalanced and unfair.

63The applicants submitted that the trial judge summarised the prosecution evidence at length and then indicated in one sentence that ""you will note there was extensive cross-examination"". The applicants submitted that this was the approach which was followed in relation to all of the prosecution witnesses.

64The applicants submitted that an important issue in the trial was the reliability of the passenger witnesses in general and that this reliability, and their credit, had been the subject of lengthy cross-examination of each of them. The applicants submitted that in such circumstances it was not sufficient for the trial judge to dismiss that cross-examination by saying ""he was cross-examined extensively by Ms David and Mr Wallach. Each of them have taken you to what they submitted are the important parts of that cross-examination"" (SU 37.5).

65Bin Radimin submitted that when his evidence was summarised by the trial judge, specific attention was given to the prosecution critique of his evidence. Bin Radimin accepted, however, that his cross-examination was treated in the same way by the trial judge as was the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. In relation to Bin Zakhria, he submitted that his Honour had not set out any of the detail of his case as disclosed in the DIAC interview. He noted that the interview had been tendered as an exhibit and there was no limitation on its use. Bin Zakhria submitted that in such circumstances its content necessitated some comment by the trial judge in order to properly summarise the defence case.

66The applicants accepted that a trial judge was not bound to discuss all the evidence, or to analyse all of the conflicts in the evidence, but submitted that ""nevertheless, the requirement of fairness means that ordinarily the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury"" (Domican v R [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 at 560-561).

67The applicants also relied upon Healey v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 235 where Smart AJ (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said:

""62 There is a substantial body of authority that a summing-up must put the defence case fairly and adequately to the jury. The jury must be given an adequate opportunity of understanding and giving effect to the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence. See Stokes v The Queen (1960) 105 CLR 279 at 284, R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54 at [93] and the cases there cited. ...""

68In summary, the applicants submitted that because the trial judge had unfairly emphasised the detail of the evidence of the witnesses for the Crown, and had not properly put the defence case, the summing up was unfair and unbalanced and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. This was so, notwithstanding the lack of complaint by counsel at trial.

69In order to assess the correctness of the applicants' submissions on this ground, it is necessary to set out in some detail the structure and content of the summing up. In doing so, it needs to be kept in mind that in submissions at trial, counsel for the applicants had set out in considerable detail contradictions and discrepancies which they said existed in the evidence of the passengers. The effect of the submissions was not so much to put forward a positive case on behalf of the defence, but rather to establish that the evidence relied upon by the Crown was so unreliable as to not be capable of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

70In the summing up (SU 3) his Honour gave the conventional direction concerning the jury's capacity to accept part of the evidence of a witness, but to reject other parts of the evidence of the same witness. He explained the distinction between the honesty of a witness and the reliability of that witness' evidence. Because of the issues in this case, that conventional direction was important. 

71His Honour set out and discussed the elements of the offence which the Crown had to establish. Some of that part of the summing up can be seen at [26] and [27] hereof. His Honour then summarised the response by the defence:

""The way the matter has been conducted before you by each counsel for the accused is that, consistent with the opening addresses that counsel gave to you at the start of the trial, each accused disputes that he intentionally facilitated the bringing or coming of the group to Australia. Each accused is not disputing that he was on the boat and that the boat came to Australia with twenty-three non citizens but each accused disputes element 2, that he had intentionally so facilitated, and as you have heard the submissions of counsel for the accused, there is no dispute as regards element 3 that five or more of the twenty three people were non citizens who had no lawful right to enter Australia. But, consistent with the opening address by counsel for each of the accused, element 4 is in issue: whether the accused has been shown beyond reasonable doubt to have known or believed that at least five of them had no lawful right to come, or else he was reckless as to the fact that at least five of them had no lawful right to come to Australia.

Members of the jury as you can see the major source of the submissions by counsel for the accused, and the issues that appear to be in dispute in this trial, are those mental elements of whether the accused intentionally facilitated bringing the group to Australia and whether the accused knew or believed, or was reckless to the issue, that at least five of them had no lawful right to come to Australia. Those elements that you might think are in dispute concern proof of the mental awareness of an accused person. Members of the jury you are required in your fact finding to make findings of fact in relation to element 2 and element 4 as to the state of the mind of the accused at the time of the alleged conduct. ... But intention or knowledge can be proved by having regard to the conduct of the person and the words uttered by the person in any conversation that was recorded. Seeking to prove the state of mind of the accused, the prosecution can put before you various circumstances, including evidence of acts and words of the accused. And if you find those acts occurred or words were spoken the prosecution can then invite you to draw an inference as to what the accused's intention was or what the accused's knowledge was. Under our system that is a permissible approach to prove the state of mind of an accused person. 

In other words because we do not have the technology to examine the mind of a person and say, ""This person had a particular intention or had particular knowledge at any particular time"", what is permissible is to look at what the person was doing and saying at the time and permit you, the jury, to draw an inference as to what that person's intention was. As jurors you are entitled to draw inferences. ...

In this case the prosecution has said to you that of course you will be satisfied of the mental elements 2 and 4: when you look at all of the evidence and have regard to all of the circumstances in which the accused was saying and doing things, you would conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did have the intention and/or knowledge to which I have referred. In some cases circumstantial evidence might turn out to be thin and ambiguous and you could not place any reliance upon it; but in other cases circumstantial evidence may be strong and may be compelling. ... You may not, as a matter of law, find the accused guilty on a count unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable explanation of the evidence other than the guilt of the accused. That is, when you look at the evidence as a whole relating to the charge, you should ask yourself the question: ""Has the prosecution proven beyond reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable explanation or theory of the evidence consistent with the innocence of the accused?"" ... If the prosecution seeks to prove an element such as one relating to the state of mind of the accused, by using circumstantial evidence, then that conclusion as to the existence of that state of mind of the accused must be the only rational inference available to be drawn on all of the evidence."" (SU 13 - 17)

72The trial judge put the ""duress"" and ""sudden or extraordinary event"" defences of Bin Radimin to the jury and no complaint is made about that (SU 22 - 25).

73While it is true that his Honour did not set out the particular challenges made by the defence to the evidence of each passenger, he did provide a strong warning as to the unreliability of the passenger evidence generally, and specifically mentioned the language difficulties:

""Now members of the jury in this case the prosecution substantially relies upon evidence given by persons who were passengers upon the boat and, members of the jury, when you think about the role played by the passengers, you could conclude that the passengers might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events that give rise to these proceedings. ... 

So the law of our country requires that I give you certain warnings and directions concerning the evidence of the passengers. I give such warnings in every case in which reliance is had upon a witness' evidence where that witness might reasonably be supposed to be criminally concerned in the events that give rise to the proceedings that are before the court. They are not given in this case because I have formed any particular view about the passengers, or that I have formed any particular view of the evidence of any passenger or witness. The need to give such directions arises because the courts have over many years accumulated a considerable amount of experience concerning reliability of evidence given by a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events that give rise to the proceedings before the court. That experience would not readily be known to general members of the public or members of the jury. That experience of the courts over many years has shown that the evidence given by a witness who might be considered to be reasonably involved in the conduct that brings the passengers to Australia - and the accused before the court - that such evidence is often shown to be unreliable. I do not intend to suggest however that such evidence is always unreliable. My purpose in giving these directions is to warn you that evidence of such a witness - and you will recall I am saying such a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to these criminal proceedings - that such a witness may be unreliable and you therefore should approach the evidence of such witnesses with caution in the way in which I will outline shortly. I am referring to each of the seven passengers when I give you this direction.

There are no doubt many reasons why the evidence of such a person may be unreliable; and possible reasons may be that you may think it is natural that a witness, who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to these proceedings, might want to shift the blame from himself onto others or to justify his conduct and in that process the witness may construct untruthful stories; those stories might be to play down his own part in the activities and play up the part of others. ... There may be reasons why false evidence could be given by such a person. It is not for the accused to establish that reason as to why the witness is not to be believed. Experience of the courts has shown that once such a witness has given a version to the police inculpating an accused person he may feel locked into that version even if it contained inaccuracies, or even if it was substantially untrue. In relation to the evidence of such a witness a number of motives for being untruthful were explored; you should bear in mind that there may be unknown motives which cannot be explored in cross-examination. Therefore I say to you, members of the jury, when you assess the evidence of each passenger you must remember the warnings and directions I have just given you. I am not saying to you that the evidence of a passenger or any passenger or all passengers is unreliable; I urge that you treat their evidence carefully and approach it with caution.

I also say this to you members of the jury about potentially unreliable evidence - and that relates to evidence that is led by the prosecution as regards the interpretation of gestures by the passengers. And as you are aware, on the prosecution's case, the witnesses were not able to speak Indonesian and the accused were not able to speak the Afghan language either. And so a number of the passengers have given evidence of their interpretation of certain communications they had with one or both of the accused. Now you must be cautious about that members of the jury, when you think about what I am saying to you. You should approach it with caution, you might think that is only common sense. Sometimes when people are seeking to communicate by gestures, one person might form the view that the person means certain things and he is wrong and the other person might also be mistaken. So you will approach with caution your interpretation of gestures and, similarly, you will approach with caution the evidence given by passengers as to whether there were words spoken in a language foreign to the language of the accused, in this case in English. You will recall it was suggested by some passengers that he and other individual passengers, not all of them, had heard certain words being uttered such as ""Australia"" or other words including ""Ashmore Reef"" and the like - I am not meaning to suggest all passengers gave the same evidence on the topic, they did not. But you would approach with some caution - it does not mean that you cannot accept the evidence - but you would approach it from a cautious approach as to whether that evidence was reliable and as to whether you could rely upon, for instance, a person who spoke the Afghani language understanding a word uttered in English by a person who spoke only the Indonesian language."" (SU 26 - 29)

74In relation to the applicants' evidence, his Honour gave the conventional direction that even if their evidence were not accepted by the jury, it was still necessary for the Crown to prove its case and if there remained a reasonable doubt in accepting the Crown's case, there had to be an acquittal. His Honour also gave the conventional direction as to an accused choosing not to give evidence. His Honour referred to the DIAC statement which Bin Zakhria had given to the Immigration Authorities. In relation to that statement, his Honour said:

""You will recall however, that Mr Bin Zakhria made those statements when he was not on oath or under an affirmation and he was not subject to cross-examination in the sense that ordinary evidence would be subjected to."" (SU 31)

75His Honour gave a conventional direction as to the use which the jury could make of the good character of both accused. No criticism is made of those directions, except that his Honour did not summarise the evidence of the applicants.

76When his Honour came to the evidence in the prosecution case, he directed the jury that they could take into account that only seven of twenty three passengers had been called by the prosecution to give evidence. His Honour said:

""Now members of the jury I am going to very briefly summarise to you the evidence in the trial, and it is going to be very brief."" (SU 33)

77His Honour's treatment of the evidence of the four passengers who gave evidence as to intention is illustrative of his approach to the evidence of the passengers generally. In relation to MAG, his Honour recounted evidence which was uncontroversial. In relation to the contentious material, his Honour said:

""He alleged that he had heard the younger of the crew utter the word ""federal police."" He described being on the island. Now members of the jury that's a brief summary of what he said in his evidence- in-chief. He was cross-examined extensively by Ms David and Mr Wallach. Each of them have taken you to what they submitted are the important parts of that cross-examination."" (SU 37)

78In relation to SMD, his Honour set out the uncontroversial evidence. He made no reference at all to the evidence which was controversial and subject to challenge. His Honour said:

""He was subjected to an identification process and purported to identify the two crew members that travelled on the boat with him to Australia. He also was cross-examined at length. Both counsel for the accused have taken you to portions of his evidence; you have regard to those submissions."" (SU 38)

79His Honour set out the uncontroversial evidence of HAA. In relation to the evidence which was challenged, his Honour did not refer to his evidence in chief, but to the evidence which he gave under cross-examination. His Honour said:

""His cross-examination continued. He said that the older man controlled the steering of the boat, by his feet on occasions. He also saw the older crew member and ""his assistant"" go into the engine compartment; on very rare occasions that assistant steered the boat. He did not hear the crew utter an English word, but he did hear the captain once say ""Australia"" and ""Ashmore Reef"". You have had a lot of submissions to you about that evidence and you will have regard to the submissions Ms David, Ms Crown and Mr Wallach made to you. He said that on the fifth day, as he understood it, the passengers became upset. He said he did not see any gestures. He thought the passengers were upset because they had lost their way. It was he who described the boat apparently changing course and then the younger crewman gesturing and pointing to the sky and the boat changed direction. It continued until about 2pm and later they saw some lights and they arrived at the island about 2am. They slept on the boat until 7am and with daylight they saw the other Indonesian fishing boats around. Again you will take into account his cross-examination."" (SU 39)

80His Honour set out the uncontroversial evidence of AR. In relation to the controversial evidence, he said:

""All the passengers were transferred to second big boat; there were two crew only on that boat. He alleged he heard certain words spoken in English by the crew, being ""international waters"" and ""Australia"". When I say by the crew he nominated one or other of the accused. He alleged that the final boat he was on for four days and some four nights and the boat arrived on the island about 11pm. He described the older man as driving the boat. He was cross-examined in detail. You will take into account all of that evidence."" (SU 42)

81His Honour set out in detail the evidence in chief of Bin Radimin. His Honour said:

""His allegation is that he was going to Bali to obtain work. He had never been the captain of the boat. He said he was walking around the beach looking for some work and a stranger approached him and offered him some work. He asked what type of work it was and the man said ""You are taking people on a holiday."" He said he did not understand the English word ""holiday"" and the man eventually said ""You are taking people on a holiday just to look at the beautiful ocean around here."" The man would not tell him his name and said to call him Bapak - he said that is a term you use for an older person. He thought his job was just to take the people on holidays around the area of Bali. He needed the money. He said the man said it would take ten days or so ""just around Bali"". He was given 5,000,000 Rupiah; the prosecution has submitted to you that such is a very substantial sum of money. You will recall that the accused said that he would be paid varying sums; sometimes he could go a week without working. I think I asked him whether he could earn more than 100,000 rupia in a week and, as I recollect, his evidence was he could not expect to earn that kind of money. ... So the prosecution, effectively, submit to you that he was given more than one year's salary in cash from a complete stranger, who did not even ask him whether he could steer a boat. The prosecution has put to you, effectively, that you will not believe Mr Bin Radimin's account. Ms David puts to you that you will accept that he had led a simple life - he is not a sophisticated individual. He was trying to do the best to earn money for his wife and children and he was ""the innocent dupe"" of the persons who had approached him. They are all the arguments you will weigh up, members of the jury. They are entirely matters for you as the jury."" (SU 44 - 45)

82His Honour then set out in further detail the evidence of Bin Radimin as to how the voyage progressed and Mr Bin Radimin's denial that he had ever heard or used words such as ""Australia"", ""Ashmore Reef"" or ""federal police"". His Honour concluded the review of the evidence of Mr Bin Radimin by saying:

""Members of the jury, he was cross-examined at length. You will take into account all of that material. You have heard what I have said to you about what use you can make of his evidence. It is a fact he was not obliged to submit himself for evidence."" (SU 46)

83His Honour concluded his summing up as follows:

""Members of the jury, the submissions will be strongly in your mind. I do not intend to repeat them. The prosecution says that it has established each of the elements beyond reasonable doubt and in particular has drawn your attention to the evidence that establishes, in the Crown Prosecutor's words, the elements of the mental state of each accused in carrying out what the Crown says is the offence. You will give such weight as you think is appropriate to the prosecution submissions. The prosecution submissions are particularly dismissive of Mr Bin Radimin's account that a stranger approaches him at a beach and offers him what - it is a matter for you - might be more than a year's salary in cash. 

You will remember though that Ms David made submissions to you that this is a simple person. He has not got his own passport. He is not aware of the wider world. He had not, according to him, met people from Afghanistan before. He had only very limited geographical knowledge. He did not know where he was going. She puts to you, effectively, that the true people smugglers ""duped"" him and of course they are ""using"" someone like him. He is just mere fodder to them - they send him off to Australia with currency which in our country is a small sum, hardly more than A$500, and he is expendable effectively. I do not know if that was the word she used but she was saying that he had been duped, he is a victim. He did not have the intent to bring these people to Australia, nor did he know or believe nor was he reckless that they did not have an entitlement to come to Australia. He had never had a visa himself; he had never had a passport himself and she urged upon you that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. She asked that you return a verdict of not guilty.

You have heard detailed submissions from Mr Wallach today. He has submitted to you that he effectively had embraced a number of the submissions of Ms David. She had drawn your attention to the unreliability of the passengers. She drew your attention to the fact there was one passenger who told immigration that he had fought for six months in the Afghan army. When confronted in the witness box, he said, ""Oh there must have been an interpreting problem."" You will recall that the Crown then had access to the recording of the interview and had a new interpreter interpret it; and it did have some variations but it did not have a variation about him telling Immigration that he had been in the Afghan army for six months. Now all of those submissions have been made to you by Ms David; and Mr Wallach today in detail took you through a number of the witnesses. He put to you they are unreliable. As an example he said to you that one witness denied that he had said that he had an Afghanistan passport - he said the interpreter must have misinterpreted, that actually he had a ""taskira"", which is an identity card. In due course there has been tendered before you the interview and the police officer - the case officer - gave evidence that in that interview by that passenger he did mention the word ""passport"" and he never mentioned ""taskira"" or identity card. Now they are all matters for you. ... Do not think that I have sought to summarise all of the submissions. There are limits to a summing-up, and you are aware that if you wish to have any evidence re-read that can be achieved."" (SU 47 - 48)

84I have set out parts of the summing up in considerable detail. I have done this to set out the basis for my conclusion that the summing up was not unbalanced in the way submitted. In particular, it is not correct that his Honour summarised the prosecution evidence at length and then briefly dismissed the defence case. On the contrary, as the analysis of the passengers' relevant evidence makes clear, if anything, his Honour only briefly dealt with those parts of the Crown case which were important to establish the mental state of the applicant. The summary of the competing cases at the end of the summing up highlighted the issues in the trial and the respective cases of the parties.

85I am not satisfied that the summing up of the trial judge was unbalanced in that it unduly favoured the prosecution case and did not fairly set out the defence case. A fair reading of the summing up simply does not support that submission.

86It is true, however, that his Honour did not go into the specific detail of the evidence of the passengers, either in chief or in cross-examination. That, however, does not establish that the summing up was unbalanced or that the respective defence cases were not put fairly so as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. 

87This issue was considered in Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 295 ALR 624. The Court (French CJ, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Gageler JJ) said in relation to the trial judge's summing up of the defence cases:

45 ... his Honour drew attention to the criticisms made by each appellant of those parts of the evidence that were relevant to the case against him. What his Honour did not do was to deal separately with the case of each appellant, instructing on how liability might arise in each of the ways the case was put and reminding the jury of the evidence as it applied to each appellant's case. At the completion of the narrative review of the evidence, his Honour reminded the jury of the submissions of counsel.

46 The reasons of the Full Court contain a detailed analysis of the summing-up. There is no need to repeat that analysis in these reasons. Doyle CJ said that the trial judge's approach to summing-up the case in this respect was not ""the usual approach"" but that despite that circumstance it was adequate. In this Court, the appellants submit that the Full Court erred in so concluding. The failure to sum up the cases separately was said to be contrary to a requirement of the fair trial of multiple accused. The authority on which the appellants relied for this proposition was R v Towle. Street CJ, giving the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, said that, save for unusual cases, where two or more persons are being tried together:

""it is the clear duty of the trial judge to separate for the jury's consideration the evidence properly relevant and material in the case of each, and to present the case made against each of the accused separately.""

47 That statement was made in the context of a trial at which the evidence against each accused differed. This was not such a trial. With the exception of Sem's statement, all of the evidence at the trial was admissible against each appellant. There is no template for summing-up a case involving multiple accused any more than for a trial of a single accused. Doyle CJ was right to reject the submission that it was an error for the trial judge to depart from structuring his summing-up in ""the usual way"". 

48 Doyle CJ considered that to have summed up the case for each appellant separately on each of the alternative bases of liability would have added considerably to the length and complexity of the charge. Huynh was critical of this aspect of his Honour's reasons. He submitted that the task of separately distilling the evidence against him would have added little time. The submission wrongly assumed that the evidence relevant to consideration of whether Huynh's liability had been established (whether as an aider and abettor, a party to a joint enterprise to murder or a party to an agreement to assault with the necessary foresight) was that of the witnesses who gave an account of the things Huynh did at the scene. The whole of the evidence (save for Sem's statement) was relevant to the consideration of Huynh's liability in each of the ways the case was left.

49 It was the responsibility of the trial judge to structure the summing-up in a way that he assessed would most effectively distil the issues for determination in each case and, to the extent that it was necessary to do so, to remind the jury of the evidence bearing on the determination of those issues. Given that the whole of the oral evidence was common to the three cases, and that many of the factual issues were common to liability in each case, the approach that his Honour adopted was one which avoided a deal of needless repetition. Critical to the appellants' separate cases were the suggested weaknesses in the evidence that implicated each as engaged in the assault on the deceased and in other acts of violence at the scene. The trial judge drew attention to these criticisms of the evidence and to their significance to the case against each appellant in the course of reviewing the evidence.""

88Observations to similar effect were made by Wood J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Badgery-Parker J agreed) in Williams v R (1990) 50 A Crim R 213 at 214:

""There is a risk that the real purpose of summing up has been lost. It is not to deliver an immaculate lecture, or even an explanation of legal principles and the philosophies behind them, for the benefit of the lay members of the community who are selected on juries. It should involve no more and no less than a clear and manageable explanation of the issues which are left to the jurors in the particular case before them. There is no need to venture beyond a clear statement of the relevant legal principles as they affect the particular case and against which they are to apply their decisions on the factual questions which arise.

Simple and concise summings up which leave the jury in a position to come to a verdict upon a proper basis should be the aim. Two things should not be overlooked. The first is that by the time of the summing up the jury has had the benefit of addresses from the Crown and counsel for the accused which can be assumed to have focused on the factual issues, and advanced reasons for the jury concluding that the guilt of the accused either has or has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The second is that jurors are expected to apply their common sense and experience of life in assessing the evidence and deciding the factual issues. It should therefore not be necessary, certainly in routine cases, for there to be extensive reference to the evidence or the arguments advanced by counsel. Nor should there be any need to emphasise the obvious or to underline what really are matters of common sense. The aim of judges should be to identify and summarise simply and concisely for the jury the issues which arise in the trial, the legal principles to be applied to those and no other issues, and the relevant evidence, so as to ensure that the jurors direct their minds to the true questions to be decided before a verdict is reached.""

89In my opinion, the summing up by the trial judge satisfied the criteria discussed in Huynh and Williams. The respective cases were accurately and fairly put to the jury after the jury had head detailed closing submissions from counsel directed to whether the two elements of the charge that were in dispute were proved beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence of the passengers whose evidence was the subject of direct challenge. In these circumstances, the jury would have been under no misapprehension as to the respective cases and as to the issues at trial. As the applicants properly conceded, counsel at trial did not submit the contrary. Whilst that is not determinative of whether there is an imbalance in a summing up, or a failure on the part of the trial judge to adequately and fairly put the defence case, in this case the fact that neither trial counsel sought redirections is at least strongly suggestive that there was not perceived to be a lack of balance in the summing up or that there needed to be a more elaborate reference to the cross-examination of the passengers in order that the defence case be put.

90One final matter ought be noted. In relation to the criticism that the trial judge should have said something about the contents of the DIAC interview of Bin Zakhria, each member of the jury had been provided with an individual copy of that interview.

91This ground of appeal has not been made out and I would not grant leave, pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, for this ground of appeal to be relied upon.

SENTENCE APPEAL
Ground 3: The sentence was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.

92The factual background to the sentencing of Bin Radimin has already been largely set out when reviewing the Crown case in the conviction appeal. Bin Radimin played a more senior role by being in control of the boat, whereas Bin Zakhria was mainly involved in preparing food for the passengers and supplying them with water and tea. Nevertheless, from time to time Bin Zakhria took over the steering of the boat.

93Bin Radimin came before the trial judge for sentencing on 25 May 2012. His Honour found that he knew that he was bringing illegal immigrants to Australia and undertook that task because of the substantial amount of money offered to him. His Honour was satisfied that he was motivated by financial advantage in accepting this role. His Honour was also satisfied that he was very much at the lower end of the people smuggling hierarchy. His Honour found that his superiors in the hierarchy of people smuggling considered the fishing boat and him as disposable items. 

94In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, his Honour accepted that Bin Radimin was a person of good character and had no convictions in Indonesia. He was aged 35 at the time of the offending, whereas Bin Zakhria was aged 18. He was married with 5 children.

95His Honour identified two possible approaches to s236B of the Act which provides for a minimum head sentence of imprisonment for 5 years and a minimum non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years. A challenge to that section of the Act being applied to offences contrary to s233C was rejected by this Court in Karim & Ors v R.

96Nevertheless, the application of s236B is not without controversy. In the sentencing proceedings his Honour pointed out that in the absence of authority, he would have arrived at an appropriate sentence in respect of Bin Radimin in the normal way, i.e. by taking account of all of the factors and then by a process of intuitive synthesis formulating a sentence. If that sentence were below the minimum specified by s236B he would have increased the sentence so as to reach the minimum level specified in the section.

97His Honour noted, however, that there was authority to the contrary (Bahar v R [2011] 255 FLR 80 and R v Karabi [2012] QCA 47). The effect of that authority is that s236B in effect provided that the minimum sentence for an offence under s233C was 5 years and the maximum was 20 years. Accordingly, an offence in the lowest range would attract a sentence of 5 years imprisonment and an offence in the most serious range or category would be accommodated by a maximum 20 years. It follows that the start point for any sentence imposed pursuant to s236B would be imprisonment for 5 years. His Honour, as he was bound to do, followed those authorities. I should interpolate at this point that those two cases have been followed in a series of later cases - R v Nitu [2012] QCA 224; R v Latif; Ex parte CEPPP, [2012] QCA 278; R v Selu; Ex parte CDPP [2012] QCA 345 and Karim v R to which I have already referred.

98By reference to those authorities, his Honour set out his reasoning as follows:

""Therefore I start on the basis that five years is the penalty for the minimum category of criminal behaviour that responds to s233C. I conclude that Mr Bin Zakhria should receive that penalty. Mr Bin Radimin was shown to play the more senior role and was more experienced in life. Having regard to parity I would impose a sentence of five years and six months upon him. Section 236B requires a minimum period of three years. I think I should slightly increase the minimum period to reflect the greater head sentence that I am imposing upon Mr Bin Radimin."" (Sentence 15)

It was on that basis that his Honour imposed the sentence of imprisonment for 5 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months on Bin Radimin.

99In challenging that sentence, Bin Radimin accepted that in order to make out a ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive, it was necessary for an applicant to show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust (Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171).

100Bin Radimin submitted that the only difference between the function performed by him and Bin Zakhria was that he steered the boat and was older, otherwise there was no relevant distinction. He also submitted that by comparison with other cases which involved sentencing for offences contrary to s233C, this involved the smallest number of passengers, i.e. 23 and therefore the lowest level of criminality. The nearest case was R v Selu where the number of passengers involved was 46. He also relied upon the findings of the sentencing judge to the effect that both he and Bin Zakhria were at the bottom of the people smuggling hierarchy and had been regarded by their superiors as expendable.

Consideration

101While one cannot help but feel considerable sympathy for both applicants, given the heavy sentences prescribed by s236B of the Act, and the considerations identified in Karim v R by Allsop P at [116] and [121], it is not possible to ignore sentencing principles and principles applicable to appeals based on a submission of ""manifest excess"".

102No specific error has been identified by the applicants. No challenge is made to the trial judge's factual findings. There was a real distinction between the roles played by Bin Radimin and Bin Zakhria, which was reflected in the money which they were paid. The difference in their sentences is small and reflects that distinction.

103I am not satisfied that this ground has been made out.

104I would refuse leave to appeal.

Conclusion

105The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) In relation to Grounds 1 and 2 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.

(2) In relation to Ground 3 raised by the applicant, Agus Bin Radimin, I would refuse leave to appeal.

106HIDDEN J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

107FULLERTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		03 October 2013",2013-10-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762475,R v Jacobs (No 9) [2013] NSWSC 1470,"Judgment
1On 13 June 2013, Michael Allan Jacobs (to whom I shall usually refer in these remarks as ""the offender"") was arraigned before a jury panel and me.  The indictment contained a single count averring that on 2 March 2012 at West Tamworth he murdered David James Rixon (to whom I shall usually refer as ""the deceased"").  The trial proceeded for five weeks until, after a short retirement, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder on 15 July 2013.  Proceedings on sentence were conducted on 1 August 2013 and 30 August 2013.  The result of those events is that the offender comes before court for sentence today.
Fact-finding
2My approach to the determination of the facts of the matter is as follows.  Any fact that I regard as adverse to the offender must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.  A fact that I regard to be in his favour need be proven on the balance of probabilities only.  It may be that the evidence will not permit me to determine some facts with clarity.  It is not my role to try to construe the findings of fact that may have underpinned the verdict of the jury.  Rather, I must make my own findings, consistent with that verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587.
3I shall have more to say about the determination of certain facts in a particular statutory context later in these remarks.
Legislation
4Four pieces of legislation are of particular relevance to sentencing for murder.  The first is s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (to which I shall refer as ""the Act"").  That section is to the effect that the maximum penalty for the offence of murder in this State is imprisonment for the term of one's natural life.
5The second is Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (to which I shall refer as ""the Sentencing Act"").  It is to the effect that, when the murder of a police officer is committed because of his or her occupation, there is an applicable standard non-parole period of 25 years.
6The third is s 19B of the Act.  In summary, that section is to the effect that, in certain circumstances, a sentence of imprisonment for life must be imposed for the murder of a police officer.
7The fourth and final provision is s 61 of the Sentencing Act.  It provides, in effect, that a life sentence must be imposed for murders in the worst class of case: see Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142 at [27].
8Again, I shall return to discuss those provisions, to the extent necessary, later in these remarks.  
Objective features
9Early in the morning of 2 March 2012, the deceased was serving as a member of the New South Wales Police.  For some time he had been a uniformed highway patrol officer in Tamworth, and had attained the rank of Senior Constable.  From about 6am he went about his normal duties, including attending a road accident, and at one stage setting up an RBT stop with a colleague.   
10On the same day, the offender was living in a modest home in Tamworth.  He shared those premises with his partner, Ms Sharon Strudwick, and her son James Strudwick.  They were living in difficult and to a degree chaotic circumstances, because the offender and Ms Strudwick each suffered from a long-standing problem with prohibited drugs.  Indeed, in the preceding months, Ms Strudwick had expended many tens of thousands of dollars obtained from a family law settlement on such substances.
11At an early stage of the morning the offender and Ms Strudwick had an argument.  As a result, the offender drove away from the home in a heightened emotional state.  He took with him his pet cat, of whom he was very fond, and that suggests that he was intending to leave the home, at least for a period.  He was also somewhat emotionally aroused because, on the preceding evening, the offender had injected himself with methylamphetamine.  I shall return to the question of the effect of the ingestion of that drug on his state of mind.
12Before leaving home, the offender armed himself with a .38 calibre revolver that was in full working order.  The handgun was loaded with a number of cartridges, and the offender was aware of that fact.  That weapon had been in the possession of the offender at the home, but it is not clear precisely where it was kept.  Nor is it clear for how long the offender had possessed it.
13I am unable to determine why the offender took that item with him that morning, or indeed possessed it more generally.  Perhaps, in light of his involvement in the drug scene of Tamworth, he kept such an item for his own protection.  There is no suggestion that, when he took the revolver with him, the offender was planning to shoot a police officer, or indeed any other person.  I also reject the suggestion, faintly made in the proceedings, that he was intending to harm himself.
14Shortly thereafter, the offender and Ms Strudwick spoke by mobile telephone.  The argument was resolved, and it seems that the offender was intending to return home.  Before doing so, he stopped at a service station on the Gunnedah Road in West Tamworth, and purchased some petrol and cigarettes.  He was, of course, alone at the time.  There is nothing to suggest that his behaviour was abnormal at that stage.  He then proceeded to drive his motor vehicle east along the Gunnedah Road, in the general direction of his home.
15At that stage, the deceased was driving west along the Gunnedah Road in his fully marked highway patrol vehicle.  He too was alone.  He spotted the offender's motor vehicle, and at the least suspected that its driver was disqualified.  That was because it was common practice for members of the highway patrol to discuss persons of interest with whom they had interacted.  In the preceding months, the offender had been stopped a number of times for driving offences, and was indeed disqualified.  In fact, he had been warned by another police officer that, if he offended again, it was quite possible that he would be refused bail by the police.  As a result of his suspicion, the deceased did a U-turn, and his vehicle proceeded to follow the vehicle of the offender in an easterly direction.
16I am satisfied that, although the deceased did not activate the lights or siren of his vehicle, the offender quickly became aware that he was being followed by a police vehicle.  I am also satisfied that the offender was aware that he was committing an offence by driving.  As many persons do when they do not wish to be confronted by a police officer with regard to a driving offence, the offender rather hurriedly left the main road, and drove through some backstreets.  The deceased followed.
17The offender ended up parking his car in a grassed area some distance in from the curb of Lorraine Street, West Tamworth.  That area was part of a block of units in which he had resided some time before.  The deceased parked his patrol car on the street, alighted, and walked towards the vehicle of the offender.  The in-car video of the highway patrol car was activated, but of course it was not in a position to record what happened next.  However, the deceased was wearing a microphone, and it recorded the subsequent events.  The time was a little before 8am.  
18The deceased greeted the offender in friendly terms, and he replied in similar terms.  At that stage I am satisfied that the offender had alighted from his vehicle as well, and was standing on the grassed area.  The two men were close enough to speak without shouting.  The offender was unquestionably aware that the deceased, who was in uniform, was a police officer.  The deceased informed the offender that he was going to breath test him, again in friendly terms.
19Almost immediately, the offender fired a shot from the revolver at the deceased.  The scientific evidence establishes that, although that shot was fired from over 3 metres away, there could not, in all the circumstances, have been more than 3.5 metres between the muzzle of the revolver and the body of the deceased.  The projectile passed through the left wrist of the deceased and then entered his chest.  As the professor who conducted the post-mortem explained, the resulting injuries to his heart and lungs were rapidly and inevitably fatal.
20It is not clear whether the deceased was in the firing position when he was shot, thereby explaining the path of the bullet through his wrist and into his chest.  But it is clear that, very soon after the initial shot was fired, the deceased returned fire with his service pistol.  A number of projectiles hit the offender.  Immediately after the exchange of fire, the offender screamed ""Ahh, die, I'm sorry, sorry, sir, sorry"".
21Before he died, the deceased re-holstered his pistol and handcuffed the man who had shot him.
22The offender almost died from his own wounds.  He spent many weeks in hospital as a result of them.  Some time later, he was recorded at that location, by way of a covert listening device pursuant to a warrant, speaking to Ms Strudwick about the offence.  Of course, at that time each of them was unaware that their conversation was being intercepted.  Although the offender was suffering from the remnants of delirium at that time, many of the things that he said were coherent and truthful admissions of guilt.
23I shall discuss my finding as to the intention with which the offender shot the deceased when I come to consider the applicability of certain statutory provisions.  But it is convenient to discuss at this stage the related but separate question of the motive for the shooting. 
24It is very hard to fathom why the offender produced the revolver and fired it.  It may be that he believed that he was being harassed by police generally with regard to his driving, and had simply had enough.  If he did hold such a belief, it was quite unjustified, for the simple reason that it can hardly be harassment for the police repeatedly to seek to prevent people repeatedly committing offences.
25It may be that he did not wish to be incarcerated, either by being bail refused or convicted of driving whilst disqualified yet again.  Again, it is almost impossible to believe that, in order to avoid a short period of being denied bail or, at worst, a sentence of a matter of months for driving whilst disqualified, the offender saw fit to fire a handgun at a police officer.  
26In short, the question of motive is unable to be conclusively determined by me.
Seriousness of the offence
27I turn to assess the seriousness of this offence.  Of course, every murder, founded as it is upon the taking of the life of a fellow human being in the worst circumstances known to law, is extremely grave.  And it could be said that the use of a firearm, and especially a handgun, is itself an aspect that makes this murder more serious than an offence that is committed with a less egregiously dangerous, terrifying, and anti-social weapon.
28Quite apart from that, the murder of a police officer who is acting in the execution of his or her duty carries with it an entirely separate and additional attribute.  Police officers who are acting in the execution of their duty are, in truth, simply enforcing the laws made by Parliament or the orders made by courts.  The circumstances of this case are a perfect example of that proposition.  The deceased was lawfully seeking to administer a random breath test pursuant to a provision of the laws of this State first enacted by the New South Wales Parliament about 30 years ago, and maintained ever since.  Not only that, I infer that the deceased was proposing to use the opportunity of the traffic stop to confirm that the offender was indeed a disqualified driver, and if so charge him with that offence.  No doubt there has been a regime for licensing and disqualification of drivers of motor vehicles ever since they first appeared on the roads of New South Wales about 100 years ago, and it is a regime maintained by way of court order.
29In short, the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his or her duty is very much more serious than the intentional taking of the life of a fellow citizen, inherently grave though that is.  Certainly, the murder of a police officer in such circumstances is a direct assault upon our system of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law.
Subjective features
30I turn to consider aspects of the life and character of the offender, above and beyond those to which I have already referred.  They were placed before me chiefly by way of his criminal record and a report from an eminent forensic psychiatrist.  It is to be noted that they were not supported by oral evidence from the offender or any other person.
31I have approached the history given by the offender in that report with a considerable degree of caution, for a number of reasons.  First, as I have said, it is not founded on direct evidence from any person.  Secondly, the history given by the offender to the psychiatrist contains a number of undoubted untruths.  For example, the offender asserted that he never possessed a gun on the morning in question, an assertion that I completely reject.  I also reject without difficulty the assertion that the offender has no memory of the shooting, not least because of what he said in the intercepted conversation.  Thirdly, during the trial, although the offender did not give evidence, he instructed his counsel to put propositions to witnesses about who was truly responsible for the death of the deceased that were quite false.
32Having said that, I am prepared to accept on the balance of probabilities matters of background with regard to the offender.
33The offender was born in January 1964.  Accordingly, he was aged 48 as at the date of the offence and is now aged 49.  He grew up in the suburbs of Sydney with his father, who was a sheet metal worker, his mother, and three younger brothers.  He also has a half-sister some years younger than himself.  His father died tragically in an industrial accident when the offender was aged seven years.  His mother remarried, but during his childhood the offender spent quite a bit of time in the care of his maternal grandparents.  I infer that his upbringing was not attended by privilege or indulgence.
34The offender suffered from learning difficulties at school and left during year 9.  By that stage he was already suffering from a serious problem with prohibited drugs, including heroin, and that issue has dominated and damaged his life for many years since then.  Sadly, his three brothers have died as a direct or indirect result of abuse of the same substances.
35As one might expect, the offender has a lengthy record of criminal offences.  It began in 1979, when he was aged 15 years.  Much of it is of a less serious nature, and includes such matters as malicious damage, common assault, shoplifting, and, as I have said, repeated driving offences.  The major exception to that general proposition is that in 1987 he was convicted of multiple armed robberies and sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years.  It seems that he served, after remissions, about 7 years of that non-parole period.  I accept on the balance of probabilities that, at the time of the commission of those armed robberies, the offender was suffering from a drug addiction that was out of control. 
36As at the date of this offence, 2 March 2012, the offender had been taking methadone for many years, and it seems that his abuse of heroin had abated.  However, he was still abusing methylamphetamine, and as I said, had injected himself with it the night before.  It is also clear that he was well-entrenched in the drug scene of Tamworth.
37Over the years, he had been treated for paranoia by way of medication prescribed by a psychiatrist.  That condition was, I am satisfied, drug induced.  The report of the forensic psychiatrist records that, in the past, he has suffered from substance induced psychotic disorder, and currently suffers from substance use disorder.  But to be clear, he does not suffer from any delusional beliefs, or brain injury, or underlying psychotic illness.
38He is ill with hepatitis C, no doubt as a result of intravenous drug use.  He is not unintelligent, and has sought to use the past 18 months in custody constructively, including by reading and developing an interest in botany.  
Remorse
39I turn to the question of whether the offender is remorseful for his actions.  He ran a trial, as of course he was perfectly entitled to do.  At that time and since, there is nothing in the conduct of his litigation to suggest acceptance of responsibility on his part for his crime in the slightest.  I repeat that his case at trial was based upon the completely false proposition that another person was responsible for the shooting of the deceased.
40Having said that, immediately after the shooting the offender screamed an apology.  Furthermore, when police attended very shortly afterwards and the offender was lying gravely wounded on the ground, he was heard to be saying repeatedly ""I'm sorry"".
41Finally, whilst in hospital and suffering from delirium weeks after the shooting, it is noteworthy that the offender said to a treating psychiatrist that he ""had shot someone and needed to give something back to humanity"".  
42All those facts are suggestive that, at least in the past, the offender has been remorseful for what he had done.
43On the other hand, as I have said, the offender ran a trial founded on an effort to shift blame to another.  In the intercepted conversation with his partner many weeks after the shooting, he referred to the deceased in derogatory terms.  He said little in that conversation to indicate remorse, but rather focused on the years of incarceration ahead.  In the psychiatric report there is no material suggestive of remorse, or acceptance of responsibility, or even realisation of the gravity of what he has done.  As I have said, at no stage has he given evidence before me.
44In all of the circumstances, I am unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is remorseful for this murder.
Legislation
45It is convenient now to turn to the relevant legislation.  I shall consider the applicability of s 19B of the Act first, because, if it is applicable, its operation renders consideration of the other provisions otiose.
46Section 19B of the Act is as follows:
""19B   Mandatory life sentences for murder of police officers
(1)  A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life for the murder of a police officer if the murder was committed:
(a)  while the police officer was executing his or her duty, or
(b)  as a consequence of, or in retaliation for, actions undertaken by that or any other police officer in the execution of his or her duty,
and if the person convicted of the murder:
(c)  knew or ought reasonably to have known that the person killed was a police officer, and
(d)  intended to kill the police officer or was engaged in criminal activity that risked serious harm to police officers.
(2)  A person sentenced to imprisonment for life under this section is to serve the sentence for the term of the person's natural life.
(3)  This section does not apply to a person convicted of murder:
(a)  if the person was under the age of 18 years at the time the murder was committed, or
(b)  if the person had a significant cognitive impairment at that time (not being a temporary self-induced impairment).
(4)  If this section requires a person to be sentenced to imprisonment for life, nothing in section 21 (or any other provision) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 or in any other Act or law authorises a court to impose a lesser or alternative sentence.
(5)  Nothing in this section affects the obligation of a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person convicted of murder in accordance with section 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
(6)  Nothing in this section affects the prerogative of mercy.
(7)  This section applies to offences committed after the commencement of this section.""
47There is no dispute that the offence was committed after the commencement of the section.
48And it can be seen from the terms of the section that I must impose a sentence of imprisonment for life if certain circumstances that engage the section are established, unless certain circumstances that disengage it are established.  
49The section and the extrinsic materials relating to it are silent on the question of onus and standard of proof of those circumstances.  The parties submitted that the circumstances engaging the section would need to be proven by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt, and that the circumstances disengaging the section would need to be proven by the offender on the balance of probabilities.  That approach is in accordance with long-standing authority with regard to sentencing generally: see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 and R v O'Neill (1979) 2 NSWLR 582; 1 A Crim R 59.  I accept that joint submission.  
50Turning to the disengaging circumstances first, the offender was not under the age of 18 years at the time of the offence.
51Secondly, senior counsel for the offender expressly disavowed any reliance on the circumstance that, at the time of the offence, the offender ""had a significant cognitive impairment ... (not being a temporary self-induced impairment)"".  Quite apart from that disavowal, there is no evidence in support of that proposition, and it is therefore not established to any degree.
52It follows that the two disengaging circumstances have no role to play.
53It can be seen that there are a number of circumstances that need to be established by the Crown before the section is engaged.
54The first is that the victim of the murder was a police officer.  There is no dispute about that, and it is unquestionably established.
55Nor is there dispute about the second; namely, that the murder was committed ""while the police officer was executing his ... duty"", and I am satisfied of it to the requisite degree.
56The third engaging circumstance is that the offender ""knew ... that the person killed was a police officer"".  Yet again, that is not disputed, and on the evidence is beyond dispute.
57Section 19B(1)(d) contains the final two circumstances that engage the mandatory penalty.  They are that the offender ""intended to kill the police officer"" or ""was engaged in criminal activity that risked serious harm to police officers.""  Each of those circumstances is in dispute between the parties.
58The drafting of the latter part of the provision is a little unusual.  To the extent that it speaks of an offender who ""was engaged in criminal activity"", one wonders whether it is referring to the context in which the act causing death took place, rather than the act causing death itself.  I consider that such an interpretation could lead to anomalous results.  I shall return to that question later, to the extent necessary.
59In short, as a first step I need to determine whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he murdered the deceased, the offender intended to kill. That fact is not implicit in the verdict of the jury, because the Crown case with regard to the state of mind of the offender was left to the jury on further bases.  
60If I am not so satisfied, I need to consider the second question; namely, whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of the murder, the offender was engaged in criminal activity that risked serious harm to police officers.
61With regard to the question of whether or not it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that at the time he produced a loaded revolver, pointed it at the deceased, and fired it, the offender intended to kill the deceased, I make the following findings of fact.  To be clear, I am satisfied of any inculpatory facts to which I refer beyond reasonable doubt.  
62First, when the offender fired, the muzzle of the revolver was not more than 3.5 metres from the body of the deceased.
63Secondly, the deceased did not become aware of the presence of the firearm until less than a second before the shot was fired.  It is not the case, for example, that the offender produced the firearm and sought to threaten the deceased with it in an effort to escape.
64Thirdly, the offender and the deceased were each standing on the grassed area of the block of units engaged in a conversation.  And yet, as I have said, the audio recording establishes that the deceased did not become aware of the presence of the firearm until a moment before the shot was fired.  The revolver was tendered in evidence and I have held it in my hand.  It is a substantial weapon and does not have a short barrel.  At the time of the conversation, the offender concealed the presence of the firearm from the deceased, though the precise mechanism of how he did so is unclear to me.  Perhaps the offender was turned away slightly from the deceased, or had the revolver hidden in his clothing.   However it was achieved, I am satisfied, in all of the circumstances, that that concealment was deliberate.
65Fourthly, having passed through the wrist of the deceased, the fatal shot entered his chest, as opposed to one of his extremities.  
66Fifthly, almost immediately after the shooting, the offender screamed the word ""Die"".
67Sixthly, in the covertly recorded conversation with his partner, the offender made no reference to the death of the deceased as having been unintended, or some sort of terrible accident.  That was in the context of Ms Strudwick having explained to the offender that the Senior Constable had indeed died.  
68There is some material, founded on the state of the revolver when retrieved by the police and expert analysis of the sound recording, to support a suspicion that the offender fired two shots, not one.  However, I do not consider that that fact is sufficiently established for me to take it into account with regard to this question, and I put that suspicion to one side.
69Separately, I accept that, at the time of the shooting, the offender was affected to some unclear degree by methylamphetamine.  It had the effect of making him rather more impetuous and aggressive than he would otherwise have been.  But I emphasise that there is nothing whatsoever in the objective evidence of the behaviour of the offender at the service station, or in his driving, or in the things that he said before or after the shooting, or in his recounting of events to his partner weeks later, to suggest that he was, as a result of taking that drug, in any way divorced from reality at the time when he pulled the trigger.  On the other hand, because of the lack of clarity about the matter, I do not rely upon intoxication by that drug as a matter supportive of an intention to kill.
70Taking into account the combined effect of all of those matters, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time the offender murdered the deceased, he intended to kill him.  That intention may have been held only fleetingly, and utterly irrationally, but nevertheless I consider that it has been established to the criminal standard.
71Even if I were not satisfied of that engaging circumstance, I would separately be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, in producing and firing a loaded handgun at close range in the direction of the deceased, the offender was engaged in criminal activity that risked serious harm to police officers.
72And even if, in truth, the latter part of the provision applies not to the act causing death but rather to the context surrounding that act, I would in the alternative be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that by possessing and producing a loaded firearm in a public place in such a way that it was pointing in the general direction of a police officer who was standing a short distance away, the offender was engaged in criminal activity that risked serious harm to police officers.
73It follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of an intention to kill and, to the extent necessary, the two alternatives founded on s 19B(1)(d).  The result is that the mandatory life sentence is to be imposed.  In the circumstances there is no need, in my opinion, for me to discuss the role of the two guideposts to which I have referred, or s 61 of the Sentencing Act.
74Finally, before imposing sentence, I wish to state that there are other persons who should be in the dock with the offender but who are not.  If the offender had been armed with an iron bar, or even a knife, it is highly unlikely that this encounter would have resulted in fatality.  Because of his possession of a handgun on the morning of 2 March 2012, one life - that of Senior Constable David Rixon - has been irrevocably taken.  Another life - that of Michael Jacobs - has been ruined.  And that is to say nothing of the lives of all of the other persons who I infer have suffered grievously, and will continue to do so, as a result of this murder. Those who trafficked a lethal handgun - no doubt for profit - into the hands of a drug addict who has at times suffered from psychosis bear a substantial share of the responsibility for this senseless tragedy.
Imposition of sentence
75Michael Allan Jacobs, you are convicted of the offence of murder.  I sentence you to imprisonment for life.

2762482,Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001(NSW) [2013] NSWSC 1468,"Judgment
INTRODUCTION
1Victor Makarov (""the applicant"") has made application pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for an enquiry to be held into convictions recorded against him for offences committed against two persons to whom I shall refer as ""LO"" and ""AY"". 

2The application is opposed by the respondent, the Attorney-General for the state of NSW. 

3I have considered the application by reference to a large amount of documentary material which includes the entirety of the transcripts of a number of trials of the applicant before the District Court of NSW. I have also had regard to the lengthy written submissions filed by each party. 

THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION
4Sections 78 and 79 of the Act are in the following terms:
78 Applications to Supreme Court 
(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person. 

(2) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.

79 Consideration of applications 
(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: 

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or 

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. 

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if: 

(a) it appears that the matter: 

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or 

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or 

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or 

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and 

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. 

(3A) The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if: 

(a) the time within which an appeal may be made Against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or 

(b) the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or 

(c) the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered. 

(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. 

(5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application). 


 
PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE IN DETERMINING THE APPLICATION 
5In Application of Peter James Holland under s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 Johnson J (commencing at [4]) set out the principles to be applied in determining an application under s. 78. His Honour concluded (inter alia) that:

(i)in determining such an application, the court performs an administrative act (at [5]);

(ii)the procedure under s. 78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted, nor is it an opportunity to conduct the trial again on paper with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result (at [9]); 

(iii)the jurisdiction which a judge exercises pursuant to Part 7 of the Act (within which s. 78 is contained) is an administrative function which may be activated when the criminal justice system has run its course following trial and appeal and, in almost every case, where additional evidence has come to light which is said to raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence (at [10]);

(iv)the powers available under s. 79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry, or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and do not extend to a power to quash convictions or direct acquittals (at [10]);

(v)the nature of the jurisdiction under Part 7 involves some flexibility in the material which may be placed before a judge in support of an application (at [11]).

6In relation to the test which is to be applied in determining an application under s. 78, his Honour made the following observations (commencing at [6] (citations omitted)):

""The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case, or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease, or a sense of disquiet, in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2).

[7] Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as affecting the conclusion of guilt.

[8] There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet.""

A SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT BACKGROUND
7The history of the litigation involving the applicant is, to say the least, protracted and involved. It is necessary for me to summarise that history before dealing with the substance of the application.

The applicant's arrival in Australia and the charges
8The applicant is a piano teacher who came to Australia from the Ukraine in 1998, in the company of a number of music students, in order to take up a position at the Australian Institute of Music (""the Institute""). He had previously been the head of the Piano Department at the Kharkov Secondary Special Music Boarding School in the Ukraine. 

9Having arrived in Australia, the applicant commenced teaching piano to a number of young students. One of those students was LO who first came under the applicant's tutelage in or about 1999. LO was not one of the students who had accompanied the applicant to Australia from the Ukraine. Rather, he had come to know of the applicant as a result of studying violin at the Institute. 

10In January 2004 LO told his mother that the applicant had sexually assaulted him over a period of some 18 months. 

11Three of the students who had accompanied the applicant to Australia from the Ukraine, to whom I shall refer as AY, OG and EU, were made aware of the allegations made by LO (it should be noted that OG was referred to as AG in the submissions of the applicant). Each of AY, OG and EU then made similar allegations of having been sexually assaulted by the applicant.

12The allegations made by each of LO, AY, OG and EU were the subject of police investigation. The applicant was charged with various offences arising from those allegations for which he stood trial. The convictions recorded following those trials were later the subject of proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

The applicant's initial trials
13In November and December 2004, the applicant stood trial in respect of the allegations made by LO (""the first trial""). He was convicted of 8 of the 9 counts in the indictment presented against him and was sentenced to a period of imprisonment.

14In August 2005, the applicant stood trial in respect of the allegations made by AY (""the second trial""). He was again convicted of 8 of the 9 counts in the indictment presented against him and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

15In September 2005 the applicant stood trial in respect of the allegations made by OG and EU (""the third trial""). He was convicted of the ten offences alleged in the indictment presented against him and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

Subsequent proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal
16The applicant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the convictions recorded against him following the first trial (see R v Makarov (No. 1) [2008] NSWCCA 291]. The Court (Bell JA (as her Honour then was), Johnson and McCallum JJ) dismissed the appeal. No appeal was lodged against sentence.

17The applicant also appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the convictions recorded against him following the second trial. The Court (similarly constituted) dismissed the appeal (see Makarov v R (No. 2) [2008] NSWCCA 292). Again, no appeal was lodged against sentence.
18A third appeal was brought by the applicant before the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of the convictions recorded following the third trial. On that occasion the Court (again similarly constituted) upheld the appeal, quashed the convictions and ordered new (separate) trials (see Makarov v R (No. 3) [2008] NSWCCA 293). The essence of the reasoning of the Court in upholding the appeal was encapsulated at [82]:

""The decision to permit the trial to proceed on the indictment charging counts involving the two complainants, in circumstances in which the evidence of the allegations made by one was not admissible on the trial of the allegations involving the other, in our opinion was productive of a miscarriage of justice. The trial judge's directions were not capable of overcoming the prejudice that arose as the result of the joint trial and the admission of all of the evidence of the appellant's other sexual misconduct. No question of the proviso to s. 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) arises in the circumstances. Taking into account the matters that we deal with below, in our view the appropriate consequential order is that there be new, separate, trials"".

The applicant's re-trials
19In March 2010, following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to in [18] above, the applicant was re-tried solely in respect of the complaints made by OG (""the first re-trial""). He was acquitted on all counts

20In April 2010 the applicant's re-trial in respect of the complaints made by EU was commenced (""the second re-trial""). The trial judge discharged the jury in the course of the Crown case. The circumstances in which this occurred are more fully set out below.

21In February 2011, a further re-trial of the applicant in respect of the complaints made by EU was commenced (""the third re-trial""). Once again, the trial judge discharged the jury in the course of the Crown case. The circumstances in which this occurred are again more fully set out below.

22Finally, in August 2011 a re-trial of the complaints made by EU was commenced and concluded before a judge alone (""the fourth re-trial""). The applicant was acquitted in respect of all counts. 

23Accordingly, the present position is that the applicant stands convicted of the offences for which he was tried in the first trial (arising from the allegation made by LO) and the second trial (arising from the allegations made by AY). 

The basis of the present application
24Shortly put, it is the applicant's contention that since the first and second trials, and since his appeals against those convictions were heard and dismissed, fresh evidence has emerged which, undermines the reliability of the evidence given by each of AY, OG and EU in the first trial, and that given by AY in the second trial. It has been submitted on behalf of the applicant that the court would, as a consequence, be left with a sense of unease or disquiet in allowing the convictions arising from the first and second trials to stand. 

THE FIRST TRIAL - THE ALLEGATIONS OF LO

The Crown case against the applicant 
26LO took music lessons each Monday at the applicant's home. On each Wednesday, Thursday and Friday he took lessons at the Institute. According to LO, he sometimes took lessons from the applicant in his (i.e. LO's) own home. On most occasions, LO's father drove him to those lessons he undertook away from home. Initially, LO's father made a point of remaining with LO during the lessons, but that changed as he came to be better acquainted with applicant. 

27LO said that when his parents started staying away from lessons, but before the applicant began sexually assaulting him, the applicant would sometimes give him chocolate and fruit and would commend LO on his piano playing on a more regular basis. 

28In respect of count 1 the Crown alleged that in June or July of 2002 LO commenced to prepare the program for a piano competition in Kiev, which was to take place the following year, part of which was a piece entitled ""The Transcendental Etude"" by Liszt. When LO was learning that piece, the applicant told him that it was about sex and that when playing it, he should express himself accordingly. During one lesson, whilst LO was doing an exercise to improve his technical performance of the piece, the applicant exposed his genitals and masturbated while sitting in a chair a few metres away from the piano. When LO saw what the applicant was doing, he turned his back. The applicant asked LO for a tissue box that was behind him and LO threw it in the direction of the applicant without looking at him. LO thought the applicant ejaculated a short time after. The applicant then took the tissues to the bathroom.

29Counts 2 and 3 alleged offences committed at the home of LO. As to count 2, the Crown alleged that in late 2002 the applicant was at LO's home for the purpose of a lesson. LO was in the study, which was opposite a bathroom. When the applicant was in the bathroom, LO saw him begin to masturbate. The applicant beckoned LO to come to him, but LO refused. The applicant then came out of the bathroom, grabbed LO by the arm and took him into the bathroom where the applicant continued to masturbate himself. The applicant then asked LO to masturbate him. LO refused and the applicant took LO's hand and put it onto his (the applicant's) penis forcing LO to masturbate him. The applicant was sitting on the bath tub and ejaculated onto the floor of the bathroom.

30Count 3 similarly alleged that the applicant forced LO to masturbate him in the bathroom of LO's home.

31Count 4 was based upon an incident in a studio at the applicant's home. The Crown alleged that the applicant got up from a chair and walked around a piano stool before sitting down behind LO. The applicant put his hand into LO's underpants and started to masturbate him. The applicant told LO to keep playing because his wife was in the house and he was concerned that if LO stopped playing she might think something was strange. LO kept playing and when he finished the piece he moved away from the applicant and stood up. The applicant told LO that he should not be so ""moral"" and that what had occurred was for LO's own good. The applicant also said that he was giving everything to LO, and that LO should reciprocate.

32Count 5 was based on an incident at the applicant's home when the applicant and LO were in the upstairs kitchen. LO was washing a cup at the sink and the applicant came up behind him with his pants down. He forced LO to masturbate him until he ejaculated.

33In respect of count 6 the Crown alleged that LO entered the applicant's studio, when the applicant told him to close the door and curtain. After LO did so, the applicant grabbed him with both hands at the back of his neck and pulled him forward to kiss him on the lips. The applicant told LO to open his mouth but he refused. After the lesson started the applicant told LO that he should ""give more"". 

34In respect of count 7, the Crown alleged that the applicant took LO from the studio into an upstairs study. There was a computer in the study from which the applicant and LO had previously downloaded musical performances and educational files from the Internet. On this occasion the applicant showed LO a gay pornographic video clip which had been downloaded from the internet. Whilst LO was watching the video clip he could hear the applicant masturbating behind him.

35As to counts 8 and 9 (which were in the alternative) the Crown alleged that following the showing of the video clip referred in count 7, the applicant closed the program and told LO to get up. The applicant grabbed LO and took him out of the study and across the corridor into a guest bedroom, where he threw him on the bed and pulled his trousers down to his ankles. The applicant then lifted LO's legs and penetrated LO's anus with his penis. LO said that continued for about 6 or 7 minutes until the applicant ejaculated inside his anus. The applicant asked LO if it was painful and LO said that it was. The applicant said ""that's good"" and told LO to go and wash himself. 

The evidence relied upon by the Crown
36The Crown case against the applicant in the first trial necessarily depended to a significant extent upon the evidence of LO. However, the Crown also relied on evidence given by each of EU, AY and OG of statements made by the applicant to each of them after they had become aware of LO's allegations. It was not suggested by the Crown that any of the evidence given by EU, AY or OG was directly corroborative of any allegation made against the applicant by LO. Rather, the Crown asserted that properly construed, the statements made by the applicant to each of EU, AY and OG amounted to an admission.

The evidence of EU
37EU gave evidence that in February 2004 he was staying with the applicant at his home. He said that on 4 February 2004 the applicant had spoken to him about calling a meeting with the various students who had accompanied him (the applicant) to Australia. EU was asked whether the applicant said anything specific about any issue raised by LO or any accusation made by him and gave the following evidence:

Q: So on the night, sorry, on 4 February the Professor told you that there was to be a meeting and can you remember when that meeting was to take place?
A: Fourth of February is Wednesday, yes. The meeting was on Thursday fifth, the next day.

Q: Because you were living in the house at the time, did you continue to discuss the matter of LO's allegations with the Professor at various times. 
A: Yes, we did, yes.

Q: At one time did he say something specifically about what LO had raised and what LO had accused him of? 
A: Well, he just - yes, he said that - as I said before, he said, he accused him of having sex for one and a half years and you know he said this in details in front of his family and Victor Makarov himself.

Q: And at some stage did he say something further about the allegations?
A: He said - yeah. He said something like, 'it's my nature and I understand this by brain, but it's like I can't do anything about it'. That's what he said (emphasis added).


38When asked whether or not the applicant had said anything else to him about his relationship with LO, EU said:

""He said that he loved him like a son and he, he also said he had better connection with him than any of us even though he had betrayed, and he said yes he was surprised. He said he was surprised because LO had told his parents about it and he thought he was happy with what they were doing.""

39As the trial judge noted in her summing up, it was not suggested that the conversation with the applicant of which EU gave evidence had not taken place. Her Honour directed the jury that the issue was one of interpretation, the Crown suggesting that the statement was an admission by the applicant that he had been assaulting EU, with the applicant submitting that the appropriate interpretation to be placed upon the conversation was an entirely neutral one. 

The evidence of AY
40AY was one of the five Ukrainian students who came to Australia with the applicant in 1998, following which he lived at the applicant's premises for a period of time.

41In the course of his evidence in chief AY (commencing at T365 L51) told the court that along with a number of other students, he attended a ""meeting"" with the applicant in the course of which the applicant had informed him of the allegations made by LO. After the meeting the applicant offered to drive AY and OG to the railway station, about which AY gave the following further evidence:

Q: When you got to the station was there a conversation in the car?
A: Yes.

Q: About the fact that LO had made these allegations against the Professor is that right?
A: Yes, yes.

Q: Did the Professor say something to you about his thoughts about the matter?
A: Yes he did. He said 'I understand how awful and how terrible this all is but it is only on my genetical level' and after which he was talking about suicide. I think at some stage he even said maybe I should drive off a cliff somewhere. (emphasis added).

Q: Did you say something in response to that?
A: No I didn't say anything, I didn't.""


42In cross-examination (commencing at T370 L36) AY agreed that at the time of the meeting the applicant was ""obviously shocked"" and that he was speaking of committing suicide. In terms of the conversation in the car at the railway station, AY was asked: 

""Q: You told us about a conversation that took place in the car, yes in the car at Gordon Station, do you remember that?
A: Yes.

Q: You see what he said in that conversation was 'with (LO), you know, its not true', didn't he say that?
A: He did.


43In the course of her summing up, the trial judge reminded the jury that AY had been cross-examined to suggest that there was no such conversation in the car. She reminded the jury that what had been suggested was that there had been a conversation at some stage, and that the reference to suicide was not denied by the applicant.

The evidence of OG
44OG was also one of the students who had accompanied the applicant to Australia. He told the court (commencing at T383) that he had been asked to attend a meeting at the applicant's premises to discuss the allegations made by LO. He also gave evidence of having travelled to the railway station with AY: 

Q: Did he give you and AY a lift to the station?
A: Yes.

Q: Before you got out of the car was there another conversation about the general subject of LO's allegations?
A: Yes.

Q: Did Makarov say something about - - 
A: Yes, he did say something.

Q: What did he say?
A: He said 'I understand with my brain that what I did to (LO) was wrong but I cannot control my genes and this is in my nature to be like this' (emphasis added).

Q: Did he also say something about suicide?
A: Yes, he said 'maybe I should end this, maybe I should drive off the cliff and have suicide'.

Q: Then did you and AY leave and go and catch the train?
A: Yes.""

45When cross-examined, it was not put to OG that there had not been a conversation at the railway station, nor was there any challenge to the evidence that the applicant had made reference to committing suicide. However, it was put to him that the highlighted portion of the evidence in [44] above had not been said by the applicant. It was also put to OG that the applicant had said words to the effect ""with LO, you know it's not true"", of which OG had no recollection.

46In the course of his evidence, the applicant said that he had told OG: 

"" Yes, I told him, Don't worry and I will overcome all this stuff. In context of this rules about genetical level was that they know me so long term and we have so strong relationship and people doing this on a genetical level but they know me"".

47In addition, the trial judge asked the following question:

Q: I just need to clarify something. When the Crown asked you that you had said something about your genetic level being a sexual interest in LO and your response was ""It's not true"" are you saying that what you said in that regard was not true or that the interpretation is not true?
A: Interpretation not true. This genetic level, these words, I use these words but I never use these words about myself. And this is not true"".

The summing up of the trial judge
48Having reminded the jury of the evidence of each of the three witnesses, her Honour directed them in the following terms: 

""Now let me just say something about these statements by the accused according to the Crown case ladies and gentlemen. The Crown's submission is, as I have said, that all of these statements that have been given in evidence by these three witnesses constituted admissions by the accused that he had been engaging in sexual conduct with and towards LO. In other words, the Crown says the accused's statement (sic) should be interpreted as a confession to all three, albeit at different times, because one of the conversations occurs with EU somewhere in the house I am assuming, and the other conversations occur with AY and OG at the station on 5 February, but those statements according to the Crown should be interpreted as the accused admitting that he could not help indulging in a sexual interest LO, even though he could understand intellectually that it was wrong.

Now I have indicated to you where the accused would place a different construction on those statements. Before you could use those statements by the accused in support of the evidence of LO you would have to find in favour of the construction which is suggested by the Crown, and as I have already said the interpretation of that statement is a matter for you. Just as all words derive a meaning from their context, the meaning of these statements is to be determined by you by reference to the context in which they were said and the surrounding circumstances. If you were to conclude that the statements are open to an interpretation other than that suggested by the Crown, then they would not assist you towards proof of the Crown case. So in simple terms ladies and gentlemen it is a fact-finding function for you. What do you think those words mean? If you agree with the construction placed upon them by the Crown, they are available to you to be used in support of LO's evidence. If they do not have that construction - that is, the construction suggested by the Crown - then they do not assist you much further."" 

 
THE SECOND TRIAL - THE ALLEGATIONS OF AY
The charges
49On 22 August 2005 the applicant was arraigned before her Honour Judge Hock in the District Court on an indictment alleging a total of 9 offences against AY which may be summarised as follows:

The Crown case against the applicant 
50AY commenced as a student of the applicant in 1990 at the Kharkov School when he was 7 years old. 

51In July 1997 the applicant and AY travelled to Sydney to attend the Third Australian National Pedagogy Conference in Sydney. During their stay, which extended over a period of 13 days, they stayed at a hotel in Camperdown. The conduct supporting counts 1 to 8 inclusive in the indictment allegedly occurred at the hotel, when AY was 14 years of age.

52On the Crown case, the conduct in respect of each of counts 1, 2 and 3 occurred whilst AY was preparing for a rehearsal for a performance. AY gave evidence that the applicant instructed him to have a shower and that whilst he was in the shower, the applicant entered the shower recess with the applicant and started washing him. The applicant then said to AY: 

""Would you like to get stuck into me?"" 

53When AY said he would not, the applicant responded:

""Because I would like to get stuck into you"". 

54The following then occurred:

(i)the applicant took AY's hand, and placed it on his (the applicant's) penis, and told him to rub it gently (count 1);

(ii)the applicant then placed his own hand on AY's penis and fondled it (count 2); and 

(iii)the applicant inserted his finger into AY's anus, and removed it when AY turned away (count 3).

55AY gave his final performance at the conference on 13 July 1997. After he and the applicant returned to the hotel following that performance, they talked and watched television for a period of time. When AY got undressed and got into bed, the applicant also undressed and got into bed with him. The following conduct then occurred:

(i)the applicant hugged AY from behind, placing his hand inside AY's underwear and touching his (AY's) penis (count 4);

(ii)the applicant then manoeuvred AY and placed him on top of him, so that AY was facing his legs. The applicant then instructed AY to take the applicant's penis in his mouth (count 5);

(iii)the applicant performed fellatio on AY (count 6);

(iv)the applicant rolled AY onto his belly and placed a finger in AY's anus (count 7);

(v)after several minutes the applicant placed AY on top of him again and attempted to insert his penis into AY's anus. When he was unable to do so, AY complied with a request from the applicant that he assist in doing so. The applicant ejaculated after several minutes before smiling and saying to AY 'you're mine""(count 9).

56The Crown case against the applicant as the second trial was dependent upon the jury's acceptance of the evidence of AY. It is evident from the verdicts that his evidence was accepted. 

THE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE PRESENT APPLICATION
57I have already set out, in broad terms, the basis of the present application. The particular evidence which is relied upon in support of the application, and which is said to undermine the reliability of each of AY, OG and EU, is as follows: 

(i)evidence given by AY in the applicant's third and fourth re-trials; 
(ii)evidence given by OG in the applicant's first and second re-trials; 
(iii)evidence which emerged in the fourth re-trial which, it is said, supports the possibility of collusion having taken place between OG and EU at or about the time of making their original statements to police; and
(iv)conclusions reached by his Honour Judge Haesler in relation to the possibility of collusion at the fourth re-trial.

58I will deal with each of these matters separately. 

Evidence given by AY in the second, third and fourth re-trials 
59As I have previously noted, each of the second, third and fourth re-trials concerned the allegations of EU. In the third trial, an order was made discharging the jury. In the fourth trial, which proceeded before a judge alone, the applicant was acquitted of all counts. 

60In order to put this aspect of the applicant's complaint into context, it is necessary to firstly make reference to evidence given by AY in the third trial (that being the joint trial of the allegations made by EU and OG in respect of which the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered that there be separate re-trials). 

61In the course of opening the Crown case in the third trial, the Crown Prosecutor said the following:

""You will hear about different aspects of the relationship between EU and the accused in the Ukraine which, of course, is not the subject of the charges in this indictment, but while the accused was developing EU's skill as a pianist in private he was engaging in improper sexual activity with him"".

62One of the incidents of improper sexual activity which was not the subject of any specific charge against the applicant but which was led by the Crown as context evidence was said to have occurred during a train trip from Kiev to Kharkov. The Crown Prosecutor opened on that incident as follows:

""On their return from Israel (the applicant and OG) met up with EU and another boy who'd participated in the competition in Kiev and travelled back to their home town of Kharkov by train and in a compartment of the - the sleeping compartment in which four of them were accommodated the accused said to OG ""you've had enough of me in Israel, you go to the top of the bed"" and the boy, OG did that and then the accused engaged in sexual activity in the body of the compartment with EU and that was viewed by OG from the top bunk until he turned over and faced the wall"". 

63AY gave evidence that the applicant and OG had gone to Israel although contrary to the Crown Prosecutor's opening, AY thought that this had been in the winter of 1988 and not in 1997. Having confirmed that he travelled back to Kharkov by train with the applicant and OG, AY was asked the following:

Q: Do you remember the trip specifically that trip on that occasion from that master class in Kiev back to - - 
A: It's trip one of very many because from Kiev and back we would travel usually only by train so it was overnight trip.

Q: Right. Do you remember on that occasion with whom you travelled specifically?
A: It had to be .... all five of us ...

Q: But did you have sleeping quarters on the train?
A: Yes.

Q: Who did you share an apartment with on that occasion, on that specific occasion?
A: No that - - I don't.

Q: Do you remember anything that happened on that trip that's in the winter of 1998 back from Kiev to Kharkov, just answer yes or no?
A: No, not really, I can't""(emphasis added).


64AY was cross-examined (commencing at T192 L34) as follows:

""Q: So this trip from the master class that was being conducted in 1998 at a little village out on the - little village or little cabins is that right outside of the town?
A: Yes.

Q: And you were travelling back and you mentioned that you would've been travelling as you say with (EU)? 
A: Yes, he was back on that trip.

Q: You don't remember sucking his penis?
A: No.""

65On 12 April 2010, prior to the second re-trial, the Crown Prosecutor and her instructing solicitor conferred with AY. The notes of that conference record that AY was given a copy of the transcript of his evidence from the third trial, extracts of which are set out in [63] and [64] above. 

66The notes also record the following :

""Will be asked about train trip - & that's all.
Can't volunteer ""were lots of train trips and he did lots of things"". 


67The final paragraph of the conference notes is in the following terms:

""Now remembers trip but doesn't remember anything in particular happening"".

68Left at that point, the notes tend to reflect an expectation on the part of the Crown that the evidence of AY would be the same as that which he had given at the applicant's third trial, the essence of which was that he could recall the trip in question but could not recall anything untoward having occurred on the part of the applicant. 

69On 13 April 2010, the day following the conference, AY forwarded an email to the Crown Prosecutor's instructing solicitor which was in the following terms:

""I need to see yourself and Tanya again today. Can I come around lunch time? I can definitely confirm now that it WAS that train trip that I thought I was confused about. I do remember things happening and can describe them if needed.

I was confusing it with another train trip which I'll you later about.

So I need to see you for five minutes and ask you for advise (sic) what to do tomorrow. What time is lunch time?

Kind regards
I'll make sure my phone has reception till 3pm.""

70The indications in AY's email represented something of a departure from his evidence at the third trial. Accordingly on the following day, 14 April 2010, he made a further statement to the police which contained the following: 

""5. Since being involved in EU's and Makarov's trial back in 2005 I have not given any real thought to that train trip that was raised in evidence back then. I did remember that trip, I just wasn't sure if it was the one where Makarov did those things. I have not spoken to EU or OG about that train trip and I certainly have not spoken to EU or OG about what evidence I would be giving in this particular trial. I just thought it was important that I should let the Crown prosecutor know that I do recall that particular train trip which was raised with me in 2005. Back then when I gave my evidence, because there were numerous train trips with Makarov and OG, myself and EU where he did things to us, I just wasn't sure at the time whether it was that particular train trip where these things occurred. I remember being asked to just answer specifically yes or no about that train trip and because that the time I wasn't sure I thought I'd better say no.

6. I remember that train trip being over night in the winter of 1998 and I was around 15 years (sic) old. It was a trip from Kiev back to Kharkov after a Master Class season, like a winter school which was held in the village of Vorzel outside Kiev. Inside the sleeping compartment which accommodated four people were OG, myself, Makarov and EU. I can't remember absolutely everything but I do remember Makarov making me masturbate EU and EU masturbate me. We did this to each other at the same time. I remember that we were all naked including Makarov. I recall EU flicking me on the tip of my penis and it hurt. There was very little light in the cabin however when the train would pass a light outside you could see what was happening. Makarov was watching us touch each other and I don't remember if OG was involved but he may have been at some stage at the beginning. I do remember him being on one of the upper beds at some time.

7. The other memory I have of this particular train trip in 1998 was EU lying naked on one of the lower beds with Makarov sitting on the same bed with him. Makarov put his hand on the back of my head and forced it towards EU's penis. As he forced my mouth closer to EU's penis I turned away and I felt EU's penis on my left cheek. After this, I think that it is where it ended.""

71On the same day, AY made a second statement to police which, in effect explained the circumstances in which the first statement had come into existence. 


72When proceedings in the second re-trial resumed on 15 April 2010, and apparently having been provided with the additional statements made by AY along with the notes of his conference with the Crown, counsel for the applicant expressed concern at the possibility of AY giving evidence at odds with that which had been given by him at the applicant's third trial. The Crown confirmed that it was proposed to lead from AY the contents of paragraphs (6) and (7) of his statement of 14 April (set out in [70] above).

73After lengthy argument, the trial judge made an order that the jury be discharged. 

74On the following day, the matter again came before the trial judge for the purposes of allocating a new trial date. As to the evidence of AY, the Crown put its position in these terms: 

""The other issue is in terms of the Crown outlining what evidence it does propose to lead on the issue of the context evidence of what's being referred to as the Kiev train trip. The Crown has had (sic) advised the defence that it will be relying on the evidence of the act of oral sex that was carried out by the accused upon the complainant EU. It's not proposed that the Crown rely upon the acts that are alleged to have been carried out upon AY or the acts that its (sic) alleged that EU and AY were made to do on each other. Simply the act of oral sex your Honour by the accused on the complainant....The other two witnesses then, AY and OG would simply be asked about the particular acts, namely whether they observed in particular the act of oral sex by the accused upon EU.

HER HONOUR: To which it is anticipated OG will say yes.

CROWN: Yes and its anticipated AY even with his more recent statement would say no, he doesn't recall that"".

75Accordingly, although it was proposed to call AY at the next trial, the Crown anticipated that, if asked, his evidence would be that he had no recollection of having observed any sexual act committed by the applicant on EU in the course of the train trip in 1997.

76The applicant's third re-trial then commenced in February 2011. AY was called by the Crown and confirmed having travelled by train from Kiev to Kharkov with the applicant and EU. He was asked:
 
Q: Do you remember seeing an act of oral sex on EU by the Professor?
A: Yes.

Q: What was it that you saw?
A: Oral sex.

Q: Where were you when you saw it?
A: Top.

Q: I beg your pardon?
A: Top bed.

Q: Were you lying down or sitting up?
A: Lying.""

77Immediately after that evidence, and in the absence of the jury, the Crown Prosecutor expressed some surprise at the evidence given by AY that he witnessed the applicant performing oral sex on EU: 

""I can indicate, for the benefit of your Honour, that wasn't the expected response, ""yes"", to that question ""Had seen anything?"" He was conferenced on Friday, he indicated his answer was ""yes"". He's made some additional statements recently about it which indicated many sexual acts, none of which were oral intercourse by the accused on the complainant. When he answered yes in conference I said, pointed out, that was not in his statement, and he said ""I'm sorry, I've become confused with another train trip"". And I indicated to him then he must focus solely on that train trip. That would be the only thing that he was asked about. And, of course, the contents of that conference were disclosed.""
 
78A subsequent application to discharge the jury was made by counsel for the applicant and was supported by the Crown. That application was acceded to by the trial judge. In articulating her position on the application, the Crown Prosecutor expressly acknowledged the difficulties which had been experienced with AY's evidence, telling the trial judge that the Crown would have to ""give some serious consideration as to what it does with this particular witness"".

79On 7 July 2011, AY made a further statement to the police. Paragraph 10 confirmed that he had travelled from Kiev to Kharkov with EU and the applicant. Paragraph 11 was in the following terms: 

""11. I remember seeing Makarov perform oral sex on (EU) while we were in the train carriage. I was lying on the top bed and I saw Makarov do this to (EU)""

80AY then made a further statement on that same day. Paragraph 10 was in terms similar to paragraph 10 the previous statement. However, paragraph 11 stated as follows: 

""11. I did not see Makarov perform oral sex on (EU).""

81It will be evident that the contents of paragraph 11 of each of these statements were fundamentally inconsistent. The second of the two statements was tendered at the fourth re-trial as the evidence of AY. In the circumstances more fully outlined below, the applicant was acquitted following the fourth re-trial.

The evidence given by OG in the first and second re-trials
82The applicant was found not guilty of all counts following the first re-trial, which involved the complaints made by OG. In circumstances where the Crown case was necessarily dependent upon the acceptance of the evidence given by OG, the applicant points, in a general sense, to that outcome in support of the proposition that OG's credit has been undermined since he gave evidence in the first trial.

83However the more specific matter concerning OG which is relied upon in support of this application arises from evidence given by OG in the applicant's second re-trial. As was the case with AY, it is necessary, in order to put this aspect of the matter in context, to go back to evidence given by OG in the third trial.

84When called by the Crown in the third trial, OG gave evidence that there was a studio at the applicant's premises which contained books, a piano and later, a computer. His evidence in chief including the following: 

""Q: Did anything happen when you were at Gladesville in conjunction with the computer?
A: Well yes, I mean we used the computer for intranet (sic) or for some games sometimes, you know, especially when it was downstairs in the studio we would come to the studio and use the computer there or practise the piano of course. Sometimes Makarov would come down and, you know, some usual things like minor touching or trying to kiss someone would happen.

Q: Who did he touch or kiss in the computer room?
A: I don't remember exactly incident that happened, but I remember that something happened sometimes in that room downstairs. I remember he might of (sic) touched me or some others that was (sic) there.""

85A short time after this evidence was given, trial counsel for the applicant raised an objection to OG's reference to the fact that the applicant ""might have .... touched others"" but did not seek any direction from the trial judge at that point. As previously noted, the applicant was convicted following the third trial but successfully appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, who ordered separate re-trials. Although the first re-trial resulted in the applicant's acquittal, the Crown proposed to call OG as a witness in the second re-trial (being the trial arising from the complaints of EU). 

86On 9 April 2010, in preparation for the second re-trial, the Crown Prosecutor and her instructing solicitor conferred with OG. A copy of the Crown's notes of that conference forms part of the material on the present application. It is apparent from those notes that the Crown explained to OG that the applicant was on trial for offences concerning EU and that in these circumstances, it was not open to him (i.e. OG) to give evidence about any incident said to have occurred between himself and the applicant (in respect of all of which the applicant had been acquitted). In this regard the conference notes include the following: 

""Crown - Gladesville - you can give evid re what you saw happened to (EU) but not what happened to you.
Defence can't xx - if do I can ask qs - do I talk about video.
Crown - yes, marked transcript for you also in original police s'ment.
OG - re video - (EU) thought heterosexual.
Crown - doesn't matter - your recollection.""

87In respect of the evidence given by OG at the original trial about the applicant interfering with ""others', the conference notes read as follows:

""Crown - do you know who others.
OG - could have been Alexey or EU, maybe even Illya.
This thought of things happened a lot in Kharkov + Gladesville in.
Crown - but that best recollection 
OG - remember it happened on few occasions but don't remember exact incident step by step.
Crown - might have been (There's no mention of oral sex to)
OG - might have been but can't remember step by step.
Crown - appeal court - you didn't have specific recollection - oral sex - can give evidence but defence can't say didn't happen
Jury will be left with that you don't have a specific recollection.
OG - this sort of thing happened many many times. Can I say it might have been 
Crown - don't think HH will let you.
OG - what is it that (EU) says happened.
Crown - (EU) says you both in computer room when A'd came down and oral sex on you both.
OG - pretty sure it did happen.
Crown - will talk to you about qs plus A after talked to HH & come to an agreement.""

88A reading of the conference notes tends to suggest that OG's recollections of the events involving ""others"" may have been clearer in 2010 than had been the case when giving evidence in the third trial in 2005. The reference to ""EU thought heterosexual"" suggests that some discussion may have taken place between OG and EU regarding this aspect of the evidence.

89The issues arising from the conference between the Crown Prosecutor and OG were raised by counsel for the applicant in the second re-trial at the same time as he raised the issues involving AY to which I have already referred. As previously noted, the trial judge discharged the jury.

Evidence in the fourth re-trial and conclusions of the Trial Judge
90In the course of the fourth re-trial, evidence was given by Detective Slade, the officer in charge of the investigation, that when EU attended at the police station to make his original complaint against the applicant, OG was also present. In re-examination (T5) Detective Slade gave the following additional evidence:

Q: Was OG present when EU made his allegations about the accused?
A: You're talking about the, well, the initial allegation on sorry, which is 24 February 2004?

Q: You were asked by Mr Coyne whether or not OG was present when you first spoke to EU; you said he was.
A: Yes

Q: Did EU made (sic) any allegation about the particulars of the sexual abuse that he alleged the accused had engaged in whilst OG was present.
A: I can't say whether he did or didn't.

Q: Was OG present when EU's statement was being taken?
A: No

HIS HONOUR

Q: That would be standard procedure, that you would take a statement without anyone else being present?
A: Most definitely, yes.

Q: But if a number of people came to make an allegation or were present when an allegation was made, you couldn't control that initial conversation because you wouldn't know what it was about?
A: That's correct. It would also depend on the initial officer that took, responded to that initial allegation.

Q: So, it may well have been you were called, the detectives were called down because someone or people had come into the police station?
A: That is pretty much what occurred, yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q: Standard procedure would be to keep the witnesses separate during any detailed allegations being given by one or the other.
A: Yes, that would be standard procedure, yes.""

91In the course of his judgment (at T9) his Honour noted that in the course of the Crown case he had heard a recording of the evidence of OG in ""an earlier trial"". At T18 his Honour continued:

""Counts 2 and 3 were, on the complainant's accounts witnessed. So far as count 2 is concerned, OG's version differs in a number of respects from EU's. The diagrams are different. The video scene is different: see exhibits C2 and G. Mr Zozulya says, bluntly and forcefully, no such event occurred. So far as count 3 is concerned, OG says he cannot recall it. If it did occur, this failure of recalls seems extraordinary, given OG says that he recalls the Kiev to Kharkov train event in great detail and the summary recollection of the event said to constitute count 2. The lack of recall for later events supports the contention there was some collusion in February 2004; collusion that was not complete enough to provide total cover for each of the allegations as the matters were on the evidence before me, not discussed after March 2004. If there remains a possibility of collusion the probative value of the evidence of OG and EU is diminished.""

92His Honour then said (at T21):
""I then have to consider questions of support and corroboration. Making due allowance for the circumstances in which OG gave his evidence I did not find him a credible, convincing witness. This may have had something to do with the fact he gave evidence late at night via video link from an overseas location and I was listening only to the audio version. It may also have something to do with the fact he's recall of more recent events was not good. But, whatever the reason, when given and tested, much of what he said did not ring true. He was evasive, for example, when he said he was not 100 percent sure Mr Zozulya and Mr Koltakov were present when the masturbation incident occurred. Small details did not match, such as the A4 paper and the position of the accused and Brown. More importantly he had no recollection of count 3. Given the time that has elapsed, some difference between his testimony and that of the complainant is to be expected. In fact, if there was an exact match I would be entitled to be suspicious. But when I come to scrutinise his evidence and its reliability, in the light of the warning I must give myself, I must confess that his evidence was far from convincing.""

93His Honour also made a number of findings in relation to EU. In the context of the delay between the alleged incidents in 1999 and 2000 and the making of the complaints in 2004, his Honour said:

""So far as the other counts are concerned, the delay also operated to the disadvantage of the accused, but in a more general fashion. I give an example. The complainant made three statements to police in 2004. He was cross-examined about those statements and about discrepancies between conversations recounted in the statements and his evidence at the trials in 2005 and 2001 (sic). In response to cross-examination (page 93, 2005) he said: 
'What do you think, I can remember? I can straight away tell you every single conversation that I've had for the last ten years?'

At page 35 he said he did not remember the exact words but chose to give details to illustrate what he remembered or pictured occurred. He said, 'I pictured it and that's what I came up with. I remember"". He denied trying to colour the events.

Very few people have total recall but different versions of conversations were given. Given the delay this is perfectly understandable. That different versions were given, however, must have some impact on my assessment on the reliability of the accounts.""

94At pages 17 to 18, under the heading ""Credibility"" his Honour said:

""When tested, the complainant conceded that, given the lapse of time, he could not remember everything that was said by the accused and him. This is understandable, no-one could do so. Very few, if any, of us have total recall of conversations. This does not mean that the allegations were made when it comes to considering what was done and when it occurred. What concerns me is this. If the conversations could be re-imagined and additional words added in evidence which were not put in statements, could not the events also be the subject of reconstruction and re-imagining? It is important to know that EU did not make any concessions in chief about this but only after sustained cross-examination.""

95Subsequently at page 19, under the heading ""Problems with the evidence"" his Honour said:

""Some things EU said did not ring true to me. His account of the train carriage incident and the Epping masturbation incident count 2, in particular. I note the discrepancies between the accounts given by himself and OG in the absence of any supporting evidence from the other young men...Exhibits C2 and G also, while superficially similar, show inconsistencies between OG and EU. There is some implausibility in these events occurring when Mr Koltakov, who denies any knowledge of pornographic videos, and the complainants wife and daughter could have simply, by leaving their bedrooms, witnesses the event (count 2).

I am troubled by the failure of (OG) to support what was said in count 3. Given both men were at the police station in February 2004, there remains, as I said, a risk of collusion. (OG's) lack of memory of count 3 may indicate the two simply did not discuss the matter, although I take into account the Crown's submission that he's mentioning of other persons, presuming they would support his version, may enhance his credibility.

...

Making due allowance for the fact that I was listening to and viewing recordings under constraints imposed by the legislation I did not form such a positive view of (EU) and his evidence to conclude his evidence was sufficiently credible, accurate and reliable on its own to support the allegations. I make that conclusion knowing that evidence in such matters can rarely be corroborated and that corroboration is not required before I can reach a conclusion accepting such evidence.""
 
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES
The submissions on behalf of the applicant
96Senior Counsel for the applicant submitted that the matters concerning AY to which I have referred raised grave concerns about AY's credibility, independence and reliability which were not known and available at the time of the applicant's first or second trials. He submitted, in particular, that the circumstances surrounding the evidence given by AY at the applicant's second and third re-trials in particular, and his various contradictory statements to the police (the last of which constituted his evidence before Judge Haesler in the fourth re-trial) supported the conclusion that AY was a witness completely lacking in credibility. Senior counsel submitted that this was significant in light of the fact that the applicant:

(i)had been convicted following the first trial in which AY had been called to give evidence by the Crown; and

(ii)had also been convicted following the second trial in circumstances where the Crown case was essentially wholly reliant upon the evidence of AY.

97Senior counsel advanced a similar submission in respect of OG. In particular, he submitted that the notes of the conference between the Crown Prosecutor and OG on 9 April 2010 at least suggested that OG had discussed his proposed evidence with EU. He also submitted that exchanges between OG and the Crown Prosecutor which were disclosed in those notes impacted upon a proper assessment of the credibility and reliability of OG as a witness.

98Senior Counsel further submitted that there was a clear opportunity for, and risk of, collusion as between OG and EU as a consequence of the evidence given by Detective Slade, and about which Judge Haesler had commented extensively. 

99It was submitted that had these matters been known to the applicant at the time of the first and second trials, it would necessarily have impacted upon the strength of the Crown case in each instance.

100Senior counsel acknowledged that the evidence given by each of OG, EU and AY in the applicant's first trial related to statements relied upon by the Crown as admissions, as opposed to being evidence of direct corroboration of LO's complaints. However, he submitted that the evidence of each of the three witnesses was nevertheless important because it was the principal, if not the only, evidence capable of corroborating that of LO. 

101Senior Counsel further submitted that trial counsel, being aware that each person had made his own complaint against the applicant, was necessarily restricted in his manner of cross-examination and was also prevented, in the circumstances, from raising the question of the applicant's good character. He pointed out that in light of the acquittal of the applicant in respect of the complaints made by OG and EU, counsel would not be similarly restricted in cross examining OG, AY and EU at any re-trial. 

Submissions on behalf of the Attorney-General
102In respect of AY, counsel for the Attorney-General accepted that the Crown case against the applicant in the second trial depended entirely upon the evidence of AY, and that it had not been open to the jury to convict the applicant unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence of AY was both honest and accurate. However, counsel submitted that the proposition that subsequent events had so affected the credibility of AY so as to raise a general doubt about his reliability should be rejected.

103In this regard, counsel pointed out that the submission advanced on the applicant's behalf was primarily based upon matters concerning AY's recollection of a particular train trip which had occurred in 1998. Counsel pointed out that AY had said in one of his statements that he had gone on many train trips with the applicant, in the course of which the applicant had done many things to him. She submitted that the fact that AY could, in those circumstances, experience confusion about what happened on the particular train trip in question did not raise any doubt or question about his credibility at all.

104Counsel also drew attention to the time periods which had elapsed between the time of the train trip (in 1998) and the time at which AY had given evidence in the various trials. She submitted that in circumstances where there had been many train trips, and in circumstances where AY was giving evidence about them more than 10 years after the event, an inconsistency in this one aspect of his evidence should be viewed as unremarkable, and one which fell well short of being sufficient to raise any doubt about the credibility of the evidence he had given. 

105In all of these circumstances, counsel submitted that no question properly arose about the applicant's convictions following the second trial. 

106In terms of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant in relation to the evidence given by AY, EU and OG in the first trial, counsel for the Attorney-General firstly took issue with the proposition that their evidence provided the only evidence of corroboration of the complaints of LO. Counsel pointed out that the Crown had also relied upon the fact that pornographic videos generally meeting the description given by LO were found on the applicant's computer and provided corroboration of his complaints. 

107Counsel pointed out that the applicant's trial was conducted on the basis of a general acceptance of the evidence of EU as to the relevant conversation and submitted that in these circumstances, no relevant sense of unease or disquiet as to the applicant's conviction following the first trial arose. Counsel also pointed out that the various concerns expressed by Judge Haesler about EU concentrated upon suggested discrepancies in evidence given by EU at earlier trials, and the suggested possibility of collusion as between EU and OG. Counsel submitted that neither matter had any bearing at all on evidence given by EU in the first trial, in circumstances where that evidence was not in dispute.

108In terms of AY's evidence in the first trial, counsel pointed out that the applicant's evidence in the first trial conceded some conversation having taken place with AY, although he could not recollect a conversation in the car on the way to the railway station. Counsel also pointed out that the applicant did not deny that he had discussed suicide in the period after LO had made his allegations, an issue to which AY (and OG) referred in their evidence. Counsel noted that when summing up to the jury, the trial judge observed that the reference to suicide was not disputed, and that this was an observation which was clearly correct.

109Counsel also relied upon the fact that the applicant had, in the conduct of his defence in the first trial, specifically relied upon the truth of AY's evidence that he (i.e. the applicant) had, at one point, expressly denied that what LO had alleged was true. 

110Counsel also relied upon the fact that in her summing up in the first trial, the trial judge had directed the jury that whether they could use the evidence of the statements about which EU, AY and OG had given evidence depended upon whether they accepted the Crown's construction of what had been said. Counsel submitted that in finding the applicant guilty, it was evident that the jury either accepted the construction advanced by the Crown, or did not accept that construction but nevertheless found the remaining evidence to be so compelling that there was no reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt. Counsel submitted that irrespective of the basis upon which the jury returned its verdict, the matters upon which the applicant now sought to rely in relation to the credibility of AY, EU and OG did not, as a matter of practical reality, raise any doubt or question about the applicant's conviction in relation to the offences following the first trial.

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION 
111I have already set out the principles which are to be applied in determining an application of this nature. 

112Notwithstanding the submissions of senior counsel for the applicant, the material which has been put before me in support of the application does not cause me unease, or a sense of disquiet, in allowing the applicant's convictions to stand. I have reached this view for a number of reasons.

113Dealing firstly with the matters concerning AY, to the extent that reliance was placed upon matters relating to his evidence of the train trip in 1998, I am not satisfied that such evidence erodes his credibility to the extent which has been suggested. Clearly, he made inconsistent statements in relation to that issue. Equally, he was seeking to recall matters years after the event, and in circumstances where he had, according to his account, been on many train trips with the applicant and had become confused. 

114I accept that the Crown case in the second trial, which concerned the allegations of AY, necessarily relied upon the jury's acceptance of AY's evidence. However, inconsistencies arising from a level of confusion as to one single event, particularly where that event occurred some 13 years before, do not, in my view, lead to the conclusion that AY is a person so lacking in credibility that there is a resultant sense of unease or disquiet arising from the applicant's convictions following the second trial.

115Similarly, I do not accept the submission that the matters which have emerged in respect of other evidence given by AY impacts in any relevant sense upon the applicant's convictions following the first trial. I have previously noted that counsel for the applicant at trial cross-examined AY to the effect that in the relevant conversation, the applicant had denied the truth of LO's allegations. AY agreed that the applicant had made such a statement and the applicant relied upon that evidence before the jury. There is, in my view, something of an inconsistency between an assertion that AY is unreliable on the one hand, and specific reliance being placed upon his evidence on the other.

116The notes of the conference between OG and the Crown Prosecutor on 9 April raise the possibility of OG and EU having discussed their evidence. Their presence together at the police station at the commencement of the investigation also raises that possibility, although without more it does so in what could only be described vague terms. What is clear is that OG and EU were separated when making their original statements. 

117I have had regard to the statements made by Judge Haesler SC in the course of his judgment following the fourth re-trial. Clearly, his Honour thought that there was some possibility of collusion between OG and EU, although he does not appear to have reached an affirmative finding in that regard. In any event, and even if that possibility exists, whether it has any relevant impact upon the applicant's convictions following the first trial must be assessed according to the evidence that each of OG and EU gave in that trial. 

118As I have previously noted, the evidence of OG and EU went to statements said to have been made by the applicant which were relied upon by the Crown as admissions. In the case of EU's evidence it was not the applicant's case that the words attributed to him by EU had not been said, and the trial judge directed the jury accordingly. Rather, it was the applicant's case that a different interpretation should be placed upon the words he had used. 

119In these circumstances, even if the possibility of collusion between OG and EU exists it does not, in my view, impact upon the applicant's convictions in any relevant sense. No attack was made on the credit of EU at the applicant's first trial.

120The position is similar concerning the evidence given by OG at the first trial. Although the conversation about which he gave evidence was disputed to some degree, there was no issue that in a conversation with OG the applicant had used the word ""genetics"" and that he had spoken of committing suicide. Significantly, as to his use of the first term, the applicant (in answer to the question from her Honour) made it clear that as far as he was concerned, the question was one of interpretation, not the fact that he had used that term. 

ORDER 
121For these reasons, and having considered the material relied upon, no sense of unease or disquiet arises in respect of the applicant's convictions for the offences arising out of the first and second trials.

122The application is therefore dismissed.

		04 October 2013",2013-10-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762484,R v Staas (No 3) [2013] NSWDC 289,"Judgment


1On 28 June 2012 I sentenced Brett Staas for a series of drug offences. The offences are set out in my remarks on sentence R v Brett STAAS [2012] NSWDC 287. A couple of months earlier, on 4 May 2012, the Director of Public Prosecutions (who had prosecuted Mr Staas) filed a notice of motion naming Mr Staas as respondent and seeking orders against him under the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 (NSW). The orders the Director sought were two. The Director sought a ""drugs proceeds order"" of $62,000 and a ""forfeiture order"" in respect of a diamond ring. 

2I embarked on a hearing of that notice of motion. The Director was represented by Mr M L Barr of counsel as Crown Prosecutor and Mr Staas was represented by Mr W Neild of counsel. In due course I will mention the appearance of another person. 

3Briefly, the basis of the Director's case is this. When the police arrested Mr Staas, they found in the residence where he was arrested a diamond ring. The Director argues that that ring should be forfeited. In addition, as part of the evidence against Mr Staas, there was an account of a transaction between him and an undercover police operative. The evidence was to the effect that in various transactions the undercover police operative provided Mr Staas with amounts of money totalling $62,000 in exchange for drugs. The Director seeks the drugs proceeds order in respect of that cash that was handed over. 

4Mr Barr tendered on behalf of his client a statement by the police officer in charge of the case, Sergeant De Bakker. She said in her statement that the $62,000 had not been recovered. She went on to say that Mr Staas ""did not appear to hold any legitimate form of employment"" during the police investigation. She also said she was ""not aware of any legitimately obtained income"" which Mr Staas could have used to buy a diamond ring. I will say more about the circumstances of the purchase shortly. Sergeant De Bakker was not aware of any income ""which could be used to pay for the weekly rent"" on the place where Mr Staas and his partner lived. 

5Mr Barr tendered a photograph of the diamond ring and the transcript of a telephone conversation recorded about a month before Mr Staas was arrested. The phone call was between him and a man named Shaun Allingham. In the phone call they were discussing a ring. It was clear that Mr Staas wanted the ring from Mr Allingham and that Mr Allingham was going to supply it to him. Mr Allingham in the phone call said that the ring was valued at $25,000. 

6I found in my remarks on sentence that for each of the transactions between Mr Staas and the undercover police operative he received $500 for each ounce of the drugs which he had sold. It is common ground that the amount of drugs sold at that valuation was worth to Mr Staas $3500. 

7Mr Barr called Sergeant De Bakker to give evidence. She confirmed that she had made no observations ""which would indicate that he was involved in or had any employment other than dealing in drugs"", referring to Mr Staas. Nor was there anything to indicate that he was involved in any legitimate business activity. 

8The person whose telephone conversation about the ring with Mr Staas was recorded was represented at the hearing by Mr P Murphy. Mr Murphy called his client, Mr Allingham. Mr Allingham confirmed that the photo of the diamond ring was the one that had been the subject of the conversation between him and Mr Staas and he produced a tax invoice from Midas Jewellery dated 13 October 2011 indicating that he had been sold a diamond ring for $13,600. 

9Mr Allingham gave evidence that he had discussed with Mr Staas selling the ring to him. He said Mr Staas had agreed to buy the ring for $10,000. Mr Staas wanted to present the ring ""to his then to be or future wife"". Mr Allingham said that ""on good faith I gave him the ring on the basis that he would pay the $10,000 within two weeks."" 

10Unfortunately for Mr Allingham, Mr Staas was arrested by the police before the two weeks were up which explains why the ring was found in the possession of Mr Staas. Mr Allingham said that Mr Staas never gave him any of the agreed money for the ring because Mr Staas had been arrested before that could happen. Mr Allingham said that he is the rightful owner of the ring to the extent of 100% and that it is worth $25,000. 

11Mr Allingham was cross-examined by Mr Barr who further explored the fact that Mr Allingham himself had been arrested the following year (2010) and the offences that he had been arrested for. Mr Allingham confirmed - despite the suggestion from Mr Barr that some payment had been made to him - that no payment was made by Mr Staas in respect of the ring. Mr Allingham was cross examined by Mr Neild appearing for Mr Staas. Mr Neild suggested to Mr Allingham that his client, Mr Staas, had made a number of payments to Mr Allingham towards the ring but Mr Allingham denied any such payments. 

12Mr Allingham confirmed in re-examination that he had never received any money from Mr Staas regarding the ring. 

13Mr Barr recalled Sergeant De Bakker for further cross-examination by Mr Neild. Sergeant De Bakker confirmed that her knowledge of any employment by Mr Staas was simply that she was not aware of any. Nor was she aware of Exhibit A3 tendered by Mr Neild which indicated that Mr Staas had been paid almost $6500 by the insurance company in respect of the loss of his car. Nor was she aware of the significance of any of the deposits made to Mr Staas' bank accounts indulging one amount of over $5000. She confirmed that she was not interested in the financial circumstances of Mr Staas' wife and could not say who paid the rent on the premises which they occupied. 

14So far as the diamond ring is concerned, Mr Barr argues that it is ""tainted property"" and should be forfeited to the State under s 18 of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act. Mr Barr relied upon the definition of ""tainted property"" in s 4(1) of that Act, specifically the meaning of that expression described as ""substantially derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person, as a result of the commission of a serious offence."" 

15It is clear from s 18(1)(a) that I must be ""satisfied that the property is tainted property in relation to the offence"" before I can make a forfeiture order in respect of the ring. 

16When I look at the evidence I find a record of a transaction whereby Mr Allingham purchased the ring from jewellers. I find a telephone conversation between Mr Allingham and Mr Staas which is clearly about Mr Allingham providing Mr Staas with a ring. I have evidence from Mr Allingham that he has not been paid any money for the ring. Despite what was suggested to Mr Allingham about payments made to him there is before me no evidence that any payment was made to Mr Allingham regarding the provision of the ring. Despite Mr Allingham being in custody it was not suggested that I should reject his evidence completely as unreliable. I would have been disinclined to do that because his evidence was consistent with the recorded telephone conversation and with the receipt for the ring. 

17I am simply not satisfied on the evidence before me that the ring which the Director of Public Prosecutions seeks to make the subject of the forfeiture order is tainted property and in due course I will refuse the order in respect of the ring. 

18As I have said, the Director also seeks what the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act calls a drug proceeds order. That is an order which I can make under s 29 of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act. Under that Act I must, before making the order, ""determine whether the defendant has derived any benefit in connection with drug trafficking at any time"" and if I believe that the defendant has so benefited ""assess the value of any such benefit"". If I am so satisfied I must ""order the defendant to pay to the State a pecuniary penalty equal to the amount so assessed."" 

19Mr Barr's case is that I should order Mr Staas to repay the $62,000 which was provided to him by the undercover operative. It is common ground that that money was provided as part of a supposed drug supply transaction. 

20Mr Neild cross-examined Sergeant De Bakker to the effect that the money for the transactions was passed on, on two of the occasions, to a specific person and on the third occasion probably to another person. It also appears to be common ground - and I so found in my remarks on sentence - that the extent of Mr Staas' profit was $500 an ounce and, as I said, it is not contested that the total value to him of the transactions with the undercover operative was some $3500. 

21I am satisfied that I can determine that Mr Staas has derived a benefit in connection with drug trafficking. However I do not assess the value of that benefit at $62,000 because Mr Staas was the middle man. I also am aware of the vagueness of the estimate of the amount actually taken as profit by him and I would assess the value of the benefit to Mr Staas as $2000. In due course I will order him to pay that as a pecuniary penalty to the State. 

22These are the formal orders I make. Under s 29(1) of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act, I order Mr Staas to pay to the State of New South Wales a pecuniary penalty of $2000. The Director's application for a forfeiture order under s 18 of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act is refused. 

HIS HONOUR: They are the orders so far. Now what Mr Murphy? Do you need to be heard on anything? 
MURPHY: As I foreshadowed earlier your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: You're not seeking anything. I mean what was that section? 41? 
MURPHY: Section 41(3). I'm seeking that your Honour direct that the subject property, being the ring, be returned to Mr Allingham as the person--
HIS HONOUR: Where can I give that direction? It looks as though the Commission is obliged to arrange for the property to be returned, but where do I come into it, unless you point me to a provision? The statute obliges the Commission to arrange for the property to be returned but I'm not sure that it obliges me to make any - unless you help me with it.
MURPHY: The Commissioner of Police is obliged to arrange for the property to be returned to the person from whose possession it was seized as soon as possible after the relevant time. When one reads subs (7), a reference to a person from whom whose possession property was seized includes a reference to any person who is entitled to the property. So I'm asking your Honour to make a direction that Mr Allingham is the person who is entitled to the property and is--
HIS HONOUR: Where do I make that direction? It sounds like a declaration.
MURPHY: A declaration, yes. 
HIS HONOUR: Where do I make it, where's the power for me?
MURPHY: Well I can't do anything your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: I've refused the order. ""The Commissioner shall arrange for property to be returned to the person from whose possession it was seized"". That's Mr Staas. 
MURPHY: Yes but then when one reads subs (7)--
HIS HONOUR: It includes a reference to who is entitled. Okay. I thought there might have been something here about entitlement. 
MURPHY: Well if your Honour was to make a declaration that Mr Allingham is the person--
HIS HONOUR: I agree but where's my power to do that?
MURPHY: Yes, well.
HIS HONOUR: I mean I'll consider it if you can take me to the power. I'm not the Supreme Court. I can't just make declarations particularly regarding the ownership of property although it's personal property. Can you help me?
NEILD: No I was just going to suggest your Honour can make a finding on the fact and that could be conveyed to the Commissioner as opposed to a declaration.
HIS HONOUR: All right I'll return to my judgment.
MURPHY: I apologise for interrupting but--
HIS HONOUR: No you say you gave him money.
MURPHY: Well look that's right. And there is some complication and some complexity at a level of contract law in his entitlement to property where there's a contract that has been executed entirely by one party and either in part or not at all depending upon the evidence by another and then there's a question as to, in whom the entitlement is--
HIS HONOUR: Yes I'm not sure I can interfere with this Mr Murphy.
MURPHY: Well I think that's the difficulty your Honour and there's also a need for applications being made pursuant to subs (6) for notice to be given. There's form that needs to be--
HIS HONOUR: Subs (6) of?
MURPHY: Section 41 your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Yes I see what you mean. Mr Murphy I don't think I can do anything. 
MURPHY: Well your Honour my friend Mr Neild has raised the issue of complexity, conflicting situations and contract but the only evidence before your Honour in his application is that of Mr Allingham. The proposition is put, yes, but no evidence of any payment from Mr Staas and therefore the only evidence of ownership and entitlement before the Court on this application is that of Mr Allingham. 
Turning to subs (6) the person who applies to a Court for an order under subs (5), subs (5) commences ""If the Court is satisfied that neither it nor any other court having jurisdiction to do so would make a forfeiture order in respect of the property"". That's not the order that your Honour has made. Your Honour has refused the Crown's application for a forfeiture order which is the situation provided for under subs (3). 
HIS HONOUR: It seems to me that the best you can hope for is, as Mr Barr said, a finding or an opinion by me that based on the evidence before me your client's rightful owner, do you seek any more than that?
MURPHY: No your Honour I don't think I can there is no--
HIS HONOUR: In that case I'll stop you there. Mr Neild you haven't called your client and the only evidence before is - I'm just interrupting myself to say I'm not giving any direction or making any declaration, I don't have the power to do that - but I've been invited to find on the limited evidence before me that, on that evidence it seems that Mr Allingham is the rightful owner, why shouldn't I do that?
NEILD: Three reasons your Honour. The first is that in my submission that would be tantamount to your Honour being invited to make a declaration if that finding of fact is then going to be used as a lever to prise the ring loose from the Commissioner. It's not a finding of fact that your Honour needed to make nor did your Honour make in coming to a determination of the application that was before your Honour. What your Honour did do, and I don't take any issue with this obviously, was set out in your Honour's judgment that there was no evidence other than the evidence given by Mr Allingham. Now I can't take any issue with that and my learned friend Mr Murphy is of course at liberty to draw that finding made by your Honour to the police if and when the matter of the ring was taken up in correspondence in the police. 
But to ask your Honour to make a finding of fact beyond a finding that your Honour has made or has required to make for the purpose of--
HIS HONOUR: I think you're right, I won't hear any more. Mr Murphy, I think Mr Neild's right. I think I've made the findings that I need to make under the statute and I wasn't satisfied that the ring was tainted property. The order is being sought against Mr Staas, not against your client, so I would have to have found in order for it to be tainted property that it was derived as a result of the commission of a serious offence. There's no suggestion or evidence that it was derived by your client as a result of a serious offence. The case is against Mr Staas and I've made the findings that I need to make, namely that I wasn't satisfied that it was realised directly or indirectly, I have found that the only evidence before me was that of your client. And I accept that no payments were made, or I wasn't satisfied that payments were made. So I think Mr Neild is right. I don't think I can, in this case, go on and make a finding tantamount to a declaration that your client's the rightful owner.
MURPHY: Well given the way these proceeding unfolded, my client was served with a copy of the application and came to Court represented as an interested party. We have the situation in subs (3) which is clearly, and it's not contested--
HIS HONOUR: Subs (3) of 41?
MURPHY: Subs (3) of s 41. Well we have this, on one hand the person 
HIS HONOUR: Well you then would rely on section--
MURPHY: Subs (7), yes.
HIS HONOUR: But then I think the best you can do is wait for my judgment.

23And I will now direct that a transcript of my judgment will be taken out and made available to me for revision. 

HIS HONOUR: As soon as it is revised my associate will pass it on to you and Mr Neild and Mr Barr and then you do your best and I guess you draw the Commissioner's attention to s 41(3) and subs (7) and argue that your client's the entitled person and entitled to the property. Now do I need to make any other orders, Mr Barr, Mr Neild, Mr Murphy? I don't think so, I think I've disposed of the motion.
MURPHY: I believe so your Honour.
NEILD: So I agree with that your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: All right thank you all three of you for your assistance.

2Angelos Giourtalis (the appellant) was convicted of 49 counts of defrauding the Commonwealth in contravention of s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) and 8 counts of attempting to defraud the Commonwealth contrary to s 7(1) and s 29D of the Act. The relevant sections as they existed at the time of the offences of which the appellant was convicted were in the following terms:

""29D A person who defrauds the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence.""

""7(1) Any person who attempts to commit any offence against any law of the Commonwealth, whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be punishable as if the attempted offence had been committed.

(2) For the person to be guilty, the person's conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact.""

3In the broadest of terms, the offences involved the appellant, who is an accountant, arranging for the preparation of tax returns which were said to be false to his knowledge, having them lodged electronically by another accountant who was a registered tax agent and retaining refunds from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) when they were received.

4The appellant was sentenced to an effective sentence of nine years on all counts with a non-parole period of six years and three months expiring on 13 October 2017.

5By Notice of Appeal filed on 4 September 2012, the appellant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal were as follows:

""1 The trial judge erred in directing the jury on honest and reasonable mistake resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

2 The trial judge erred in directing the jury on breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn.

3 The trial judge erred in directing the jury that foreign residents only have to declare income to the ATO derived from Australian sources if they have been resident in Australia for six months or more of the income year.

4 The trial judge should not have permitted evidence to be used as tendency and co-incidence evidence.

5 In sentencing the appellant the judge failed to take into account, or give sufficient weight to, the long delay in bringing the proceedings.

6 The sentence imposed was too severe.""

Background

6It will be necessary to deal with the facts in some detail later in this judgment. However, for the purpose of considering the grounds of appeal the following summary is sufficient.

7As I indicated, the appellant was an accountant. He carried on his practice at Brighton Le Sands through a company, Ramace Pty Ltd (Ramace). The appellant was not a registered tax agent and thus was not authorised to electronically lodge income tax returns.

8In addition to his accountancy practice, the appellant carried on business as a finance broker and money lender. The clients with whom the proceedings were concerned were in the main relatively unsophisticated members of the Greek community who had come to the appellant for assistance in connection with their financial affairs or to seek financial assistance. 

9The appellant was alleged to have collected some personal and financial information from these clients and then caused false tax returns to be prepared. It was alleged that the manner in which this was done was that the appellant would prepare false group certificates and also false profit and loss and income and expense statements for businesses purportedly carried on by the clients. The group certificates were said to be false as to the identity of the clients' employer, the amount of income earned in the course of employment and the amount of tax deducted out of such income.

10It was alleged that some of the clients in respect of whom these returns were prepared did not authorise the appellant to prepare tax returns at all, whilst in other cases he was authorised to do so but the details were false.

11It was alleged that the arrangement by which the returns were lodged was that the false information was posted to a Mr Juan Campos, an accountant at Marrickville Accounting Services. Mr Campos had an arrangement with other accountants, Messrs Ricardo Lopez and Jorge Gonzalez, who for a small fee prepared returns based on the information provided by Mr Campos and then provided the returns on discs to Mr Vince Filocamo of Filocamo & Associates, an accountant and tax agent. Mr Filocamo would use his tax agent registration to electronically lodge the returns.

12Taxation refunds were received by the appellant and banked into accounts which he operated and controlled. In none of the cases the subject of the charges did the client receive the whole of the refund, although in some cases they received some money back from the appellant. The appellant contended that he was entitled to retain the money as repayment of advances or fees due to him. In some cases he produced authorities purportedly signed by the client to pay the money into a bank account maintained by Ramace. There were disputes on a number of occasions as to the authenticity of the signature and the circumstances in which the authorities came to be signed.

13The appellant raised a variety of defences. One was that in respect of some returns, principally ones which identified a company Ladadika Pty Ltd (Ladadika) as the taxpayers' employer, the appellant made a mistake as to the true identity of the employer. In his evidence in chief at the trial the appellant said he made this mistake in respect of Mr Theo Katsantoni (Count 1); Mr John Lagomigis (Counts 2 and 9); Mr Peter Tsigolis (Count 6); Mr Walter Mark Butler (Counts 7 and 8); Ms Leanne Magoulias (Counts 10 and 11); Mr Sotirios Magoulias (Counts 12 and 13); Mr Stelianos Mangafas (Counts 14 and 54) although the mistake in relation to Count 54 related to an employer other than Ladadika, European Enterprises Pty Ltd (European Enterprises); Ms Alice-Anne Sweeney (Counts 15 and 16); Mr John Dimitroulas (Counts 17 and 18); Ms Maria Rafeletos (Counts 19 and 20); Mr Stelios Rafeletos (Counts 21 and 22); Ms Georgina Pasch (Count 24); Ms Tina Leas (Count 26); Mr Elijah Magliveras (Counts 23 and 27); Mr George Elliot (Count 37) although the incorrect employer in that case was a company other than Ladadika, Hird Nominees Pty Ltd (Hird Nominees); Ms Constantina Vrakas (Counts 39 and 40) although the mistakes for Counts 39 and 40 were that in the 1998 tax year it was said she worked for Phoenicia Auto Services (Phoenicia) rather than AAANG Holdings Pty Ltd (AAANG), whilst in the 1999 tax year she was described as working for Hird Nominees rather than AAANG; Mr Sotirios Vrakas (Counts 41 and 42) the mistake in this case being that it was stated he worked for Phoenicia in 1998 and Hird Nominees in 1999, rather than AAANG; Ms Pagona Skoulos (Counts 46 and 47) although the mistakes for Counts 46 and 47 were that in both years it was said that she worked for One Shop Pty Ltd (One Shop); Mr Spiros Skandalis (Counts 49 and 50) the mistake in this case being that it was stated he worked for Ladadika in 1998 and Master Auto Trim in 1999, rather than Kramfors Developers Pty Ltd (Kramfors); Mr Thomas Kapetanios (Count 43) the relevant mistake being that he worked for One Shop rather than AAANG; Mr Nick Tsigolis (Count 48) the mistaken employer in this case being Hird Nominees; and, Mr Maged Aziz (Count 55) the mistaken employer in this case being Chalmers Management Pty Ltd (Chalmers).

14Thus, in respect of 36 of the charges the appellant contended that the incorrect name of the employer was a result of what he described as an honest mistake. 

15It is also relevant that at least three of the counts related to overseas residents (Counts 3, 4 and 5).

Ground 1 of the Grounds of Appeal

(a) The directions of the trial judge

16The trial judge provided both oral and written directions.

17In her written directions she described the elements of the offence under s 29D of the Act in the following terms:

""In order to establish the elements of the offence, the Crown must prove that the accused:

i. Deprived the Commonwealth of money.. or prejudiced the interests of the Commonwealth and

ii. Did so intentionally and

iii. Used dishonest* means to do so and

iv. Knew there was no right to deprive the Commonwealth of that money or to prejudice it's interests.""
(Emphasis in original)

18She described the elements of the attempt offences in the following terms:

""In order to establish the elements of the offence, the Crown must prove that the accused:

i. Attempted to deprive the Commonwealth of money.. or prejudice the interests of the Commonwealth and

ii. Did so intentionally and

iii. Used dishonest* means to do so and

iv. Knew there was no right to deprive the Commonwealth of that money or to prejudice it's interests.""
(Emphasis in original)

19She then summarised the dishonesty on which the Crown relied in the following terms:

""i. The causing to be lodged an income Tax return for [taxpayer] for the financial year ended.......[tax year].

ii. The Income tax return contained false information

iii. The accused knew the information to be false

iv. The false information was intended by the accused to prejudice the interests of the Commonwealth

v. The lodging of the income tax return did in fact prejudice the interests of the Commonwealth in that taxation refunds were processed to which the taxpayer was not lawfully entitled to (Attempt counts excluded)

vi. Using false information in that return was dishonest* or fraudulent* or deceptive* conduct in that the accused was aware the information was false.""
(Emphasis in original)

20Next she defined defraud and deception as follows:

""Defraud means: to intentionally use dishonest means to deprive another entity of their property, or to imperil their .... interests. It involves the intentional creation of a situation by one person to use dishonest means to deprive another entity of money or property, or to imperil another entity's.....interests.""

""Deception means: an intentional deception, whether by words or other conduct, and whether as to fact or as to law, and includes a deception as to the intentions of the person using the deception or any other person.""
(Emphasis in original)

21Finally in her written directions, she made what she described as some directions at law. Of relevance are the following:

""1. The Onus of proof is on the Crown. The accused does not have to prove anything.

2. The Crown must prove each of the elements of the offence to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt. The expression 'beyond reasonable doubt' means what it says. It is the highest level of proof in our legal system. It is given its normal English meaning."" 
(Emphasis in original)

22Up to this stage it is clear that her Honour was directing that each element of the offence was required to be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. That would include knowledge that the information supplied was false and was intended to defraud the Commonwealth.

23In her summing-up the trial judge again emphasised at a fairly early stage that the onus which rested on the Crown was to prove the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt (SU 6-7). She again repeated that the appellant had to have acted intentionally (SU 7) and repeated the definitions of defraud and deception (SU 9).

24However, her Honour then gave the following direction (SU 17-18):

""I am going to speak for a little while now about the issue of mistake, because it has been raised. It has been suggested to you in this trial that mistake is a very relevant issue, and I have referred to it briefly already in relation to the mistakes Mr Giourtalis gave evidence of making mistakes in relation to spreadsheets and mistakenly transferring information from one taxpayer to another or one employer to another.

A mistake in the context of this case can only be a mistake about factual issues. It cannot and does not relate to any mistake that may be suggested as to a mistake of law. I will also give you some legal directions about obligations of taxpayers as set out in the Taxation Act, as I promised I would.

With respect to many of the tax returns prepared by Mr Giourtalis states that the inclusion of taxpayers as employees of Ladadika, or sometimes another entity, was the mistake. There was evidence which Mr Ramos remind you of yesterday about accidentally putting the wrong employee on the wrong company's spreadsheet and of all the other errors which then flowed from that original error. You have heard that evidence from Mr Giourtalis and Mr Ramos summarised for it yesterday. The Crown says that there was no such mistake. The Crown says that the explanation given does not make sense. But even if you do accept it and even if it was a mistake then that does not cure, says the Crown, the basic dishonesty of the figures provided to the Tax Department.

It is an appropriate time, therefore, to give you a legal direction as to the question of mistake. A mistake can apply where an accused is under a mistaken but reasonable belief about certain facts, which, if true, would render his conduct non criminal. You would first of all be satisfied that a mistake was honestly made. That is a reasonable mistake to make to make and it was the cause of whatever followed. The accused bears the onus of proving this mistake, if you find it to be relevant, but only on the balance of probabilities. So you would have to look at the issue of mistake and it has been raised, but you would have to be satisfied that the mistake was honestly made, that it is a reasonable mistake to make and it is the cause of whatever followed. These are things you have to consider.

The mistake that Mr Giourtalis says he made was in several instances to incorrectly, but by way of honest mistake, prepare replacement group certificates for people who had not worked for Ladadika, but had worked for other companies operated by the taxpayers or other companies operated by other people; or mistakenly prepare group certificates for people who were self employed or were being paid through their own businesses or in some instances were not working, but were to his belief being paid by their spouses to do certain things, either in the business or out of the business.""

25This is the part of the direction the subject of the first ground of appeal.

26Subsequently in dealing with the evidence of the appellant, her Honour gave the following direction (SU 26-28):

""Now in this case Mr Giourtalis has given evidence on his behalf. The fact that he has given evidence on his behalf does not alter the burden of proof on the Crown with respect to each of the elements of the offence. The accused does not have to prove that his version is true. The Crown has to satisfy you that the account given by the accused should not be accepted as a version of the events that could reasonably be true and that is the Crown's obligation.

You have just heard Mr Giourtalis' evidence and Mr Ramos summarised it adequately for you yesterday. Again I will say to you that Mr Giourtalis says that at worst he made some honest mistakes about including some taxpayers on the wrong spreadsheet. He states that other information contained on the accounts, replacement group certificates, profit and loss statements are true and that they were taken from books and records of the businesses that he had access to.

This is not a matter, members of the jury, where you should consider whether you prefer the evidence of one or the other. That is not the way you should look at the evidence. You must look at the evidence individually on each count as a whole and decide as a matter of credibility whether you accept it from the Crown point of view. You must look at Mr Giourtalis' evidence in relation to each of the particular taxpayers individually and consider his evidence, taking into account the assessment you make as to the entirety of his credibility for the entirety of this evidence. If you accept Mr Giourtalis' evidence and what he says on any particular account, if you accept what he says in relation to a particular count or all of the counts, then you must obviously return a finding of not guilty. If however you decide that you do not positively accept his evidence, but you decide that his version leaves you with some doubt as to whether the Crown has made out its case, then again you must return a verdict of not guilty, because it would naturally follow that the Crown has not proven its case to the required standard of beyond reasonable doubt. It is only if you come to the conclusion that the account given by the accused could not be accepted as version of events that could reasonably be true and that the elements of that particular count have otherwise been made out, that you should return a verdict of guilty.""

27No objection was taken to any of the directions by either counsel for the Crown or for the appellant.

(b) The parties' submissions

28The appellant submitted that no direction on the issue of mistake should have been given, as the issue of mistake went to the question of whether the appellant was acting dishonestly and with the intent to defraud. The appellant stated that the error in giving the direction was a radical and fundamental one which precluded the application of the proviso contained in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the proviso).

29The Crown in its written submissions submitted that the jury would have been left in no doubt about the onus of proof. It submitted that the direction was given at the request of counsel for the appellant at the trial and no objection was made to the direction.

30At the hearing counsel for the Crown accepted that it was a serious misdirection. He agreed that although her Honour did emphasise on a number of occasions that the Crown had to prove all elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, she did not expressly state that to find the appellant guilty the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what occurred was not a mistake. Counsel for the Crown was unable to identify where counsel for the appellant at the trial had sought a direction on the issue of mistake. Such a request does not appear from a reading of the transcript. 

Consideration

31There is no doubt that the direction complained of was a serious misdirection. Intent to defraud was an element of the offence which the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt. The issue of mistake having been raised required the Crown to negative that matter beyond reasonable doubt: Peters v The Queen [1998] HCA 7; (1998) 192 CLR 493 at [28]-[30], [134]; Macleod v The Queen [2003] HCA 24; (2003) 214 CLR 230 at [35], [39].

32This ground of appeal is made out. I will deal with the question of the application of the proviso after I have dealt with the other grounds of appeal.

Ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal

33The trial judge's direction on Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was to the following effect (SU 28-29):

""It is a duty of counsel to put any relevant questions to a witness in cross-examination if they are advised of the details of that information. This is required of counsel in order to enable that witness, in this case the taxpayer, to comment on the proposition that has been put and is proposed to be put by in this case Mr Giourtalis. If the version given by Mr Giourtalis was not put to those witnesses you would be entitled to assume either that Mr Ramos was not told of such evidence before it was given or Mr Ramos was told and it slipped his mind or he did not consider it to be relevant. Mr Giourtalis in his evidence did not suggest that he had told Mr Ramos of those relevant pieces of information, so you can therefore I think assume that it did not either slip Mr Ramos' mind or that he did not consider it to be relevant. You may therefore, if you think it appropriate, consider his failure to tell counsel beforehand as a factor when assessing Mr Giourtalis' credibility.""

34In his written submissions the appellant referred to authorities which emphasised the caution that a trial judge should exercise in applying the rule in Browne v Dunn whether by directions to the jury or otherwise: RWB v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 147; (2010) 202 A Crim R 209; R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; MWJ v The Queen [2005] HCA 74; (2005) 80 ALJR 329 and Khamis v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 179; (2010) 203 A Crim R 121. He submitted that in light of these authorities the direction was inappropriate and erroneous.

35The appellant submitted that the effect of the direction was that he made up matters whilst being cross-examined and that this could be taken into account in assessing his credit. He indicated that the appropriate course was for the witnesses to be recalled.

36In his submissions at the hearing, counsel for the appellant stated that there was no attempt to balance the Browne v Dunn direction by reference to the extensive body of evidence given in the proceedings. He submitted that the direction gave further weight to his submission made in respect of Ground 1 that the appellant was denied a fair trial.

37The appellant did not indicate any substantial miscarriage of justice which flowed from the Browne v Dunn direction.

38The Crown in its written submissions referred to 13 occasions where the appellant had confirmed in his evidence that his counsel had not put his version of events to a Crown witness. He also referred to eight occasions where the appellant confirmed he had not given evidence of his version of events in his examination in chief and 13 occasions where he said he had not told his counsel about his version of events.

39Counsel for the appellant accepted that the submission referred to in par [38] above was factually accurate but said the cross-examination should not have been allowed and it was unfair to leave it to the jury solely on the basis of credibility, particularly having regard to the extensive evidence in chief and cross-examination. However, no objection was taken to the cross-examination and no ground of appeal was raised in respect of it.

40The Crown submitted that because of the numerous breaches of the rule it was not an available option to recall witnesses after the Crown had closed its case. Counsel for the Crown pointed to the fact that prior to the summing-up the trial judge indicated that she proposed to give a Browne v Dunn direction and counsel for the appellant agreed to it. It should be noted, however, that the trial judge did not set out the nature of the direction she proposed to give although no objection ultimately was taken to it.

Consideration

41In R v Birks supra, Gleeson CJ with whom McInerney J agreed, stated that the rule in Browne v Dunn does apply in criminal as well as civil proceedings in this State. However, he stated that the consequences of failing to observe the rule may vary depending on the circumstances of the case, but they will usually be related to the central object of the rule, namely, to secure fairness: R v Birks supra at 689.

42In MWJ supra the High Court again emphasised the need for care in applying the rule in criminal trials. Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ, at par [41], made the following remarks:

""... The position of an accused who bears no burden of proof in a criminal trial cannot be equated with the position of a defendant in civil proceedings. The rule in Browne v Dunn can no more be applied, or applied without serious qualification, to an accused in a criminal trial than can the not dissimilar rule in Jones v Dunkel. In each case it is necessary to consider the applicability of the rule (if any) having regard to the essential accusatory character of the criminal trial in this country.""
(Citation omitted)

43MWJ supra concerned a trial without a jury, so consideration was not given as to what if any directions a jury should be given in respect of the rule.

44RWB supra concerned a case where a direction was given in terms somewhat similar to the one in the present case. Simpson J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, reviewed the authorities on the issue and concluded that the direction should not have been given. Her Honour made the following remarks:

""[101] These authorities make it very plain that a trial judge should exercise great caution in directions to the jury concerning the failure of an accused's counsel to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn. Browne v Dunn is an ancient and useful rule of practice and casts a considerable burden of care on counsel. But counsel are fallible and more than one inference may be drawn from non-compliance with the rule. Opposing counsel will always suggest that the only, or the proper, inference is that the client (or witness) failed to include the contentious matter in his/her instructions or statement. But the reality is that that is far from the only available inference, and it may be, and often is, quite unfair to suggest to a jury that that is the only inference, or the inference that they should draw.""

See also Homsi v R [2011] NSWCCA 164.

45In my opinion the direction should not have been given. This was a case with multiple counts involving a wide range of witnesses and transactions. There can be many reasons that matters are not put to witnesses ranging from mistake, forensic choice, misunderstanding between counsel and client and, not least in a case such as the present, that in giving instructions to counsel in respect of 57 matters, the client overlooked informing counsel of matters which emerged in cross-examination.

46In these circumstances, in my opinion, this ground of appeal is made out.

Ground 3 of the Grounds of Appeal

47The relevant direction was in the following terms (SU 19-20):

""The other direction that I am going to give you while I am in income tax law direction mode is in relation to foreign residents. A foreign resident is a person who does not live in Australia or has not been in Australia continuously or intermittently for more than six months of a tax year. They only have to declare income to the ATO derived directly or indirectly from Australian sources during the income year if they have been resident for a total of six months or more.

Income derived from overseas sources does not have to be declared to the tax office by a foreign resident. The source of income under normal contract of employment is generally the place where the duties are performed.""

The submissions of the parties

48In the appellant's submission the direction applied to seven of the counts. The appellant submitted that the direction was incorrect because absent a double tax treaty, the assessable income of foreign residents included income derived from Australian sources during the year in question: Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) s 6-5(3). The Crown accepted that this was correct and as a consequence the direction was erroneous.

49The Crown, however, submitted that the direction had no operative effect. It submitted that the only counts to which the direction applied were Counts 3, 4, 5, 28, 39, 40, 41, 42, 49 and 50. It pointed out that it was not part of the Crown's case that the taxpayers, the subject of these counts, did not have to lodge tax returns in respect of income earned in Australia. The Crown case was that those persons in fact did not earn income or have the stated deductions deducted from their salary. The Crown pointed out that there was no direction from the judge that any particular foreign resident had no obligation to disclose Australian source income.

50The Crown submitted that in those circumstances no question of whether or not there was an obligation to declare Australian source income arose.

Consideration

51The direction erroneously stated the law so far as it concerned tax payable on Australian source income derived by a foreign resident. However, in my opinion, the error was entirely inconsequential.

52I have reviewed the evidence in relation to each count below. As is apparent from that review, the direction was inconsequential as the claim on each of the counts in question was based on the fact that the relevant taxpayers had derived no Australian income during the years in question, nor had the deductions claimed been deducted from any income which they earned. The misdirection was inconsequential and there was no miscarriage of justice.

53It follows that this ground of appeal was not made out.

Ground 4 of the Grounds of Appeal

54The tendency and coincidence notice the subject of this ground was served on 20 May 2011. It was in the following terms:

""Notice is hereby given that the Prosecution presently intends to adduce evidence of:

(a) 'tendency' pursuant to the tendency rule in sub-section 97(1) of the Evidence Act 1995, ie. evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or tendency that a person has or had to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind; and

(b) 'coincidence' evidence pursuant to the coincidence rule in sub-section 98(1) of the Evidence Act 1995, ie. evidence that 2 or more related events occurred to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind.

1. The person whose 'tendency' is the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced is Angelos Giourtalis (the 'Accused').

2. The 'tendency' sought to be proved by the Prosecution is that the Accused has or had the following tendencies:

(a) a tendency to cause income tax returns to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (the 'ATO') containing information which the Accused knew to be false, including false information relating to:

(i) income; and

(ii) tax instalment deductions;

(b) a tendency to cause income tax returns to be lodged with the ATO containing false references to the named taxpayer being employed by:

(i) Ladadika Pty Limited;

(ii) Hird Nominees Pty Limited; or

(iii) Phoenicia Auto Service;

(c) a tendency to cause income tax returns to be lodged with the ATO without first obtaining approval from the named taxpayer; and

(d) a tendency to receive tax refund cheques issued in the names of taxpayers and to deposit those cheques into bank accounts controlled by him.

3. The 'coincidence' evidence is to be tendered to prove that:

(a) it was not a co-incidence that the Accused caused income tax returns to be lodged for taxpayers named:

(i) Anastasia Bouzianos;

(ii) Roxani Stavrou;

(iii) Georgios Tsamados;

(iv) George Elliot;

(v) Constantina Vrakas;

(vi) Sotirios Vrakas; and

(vii) Nick Tsigolis;

(the 'relevant taxpayers');

(b) it was not a co-incidence that the Accused caused income tax returns to be lodged for the relevant taxpayers which contained false information relating to:

(i) income; and

(ii) tax instalment deductions;

(e) it was not a co-incidence that the Accused caused income tax returns to be lodged for the relevant taxpayers which contained references to the taxpayer being employed by:

(i) Ladadika Pty Limited;

(ii) Hird Nominees Pty Limited; or

(iii) Phoenicia Auto Service; and

(f) it was not a co-incidence that the Accused caused income tax returns to be lodged for the relevant taxpayers without first obtaining approval from the taxpayer; and

(g) it was not a co-incidence that the Accused received tax refund cheques issued in the names of the relevant taxpayers and deposited those cheques into bank accounts controlled by him.

4. The 'tendency' and 'coincidence' evidence is sought to be adduced in relation to counts 3, 4, 5, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 48 on the Indictment.

5. The substance of the 'tendency' and 'coincidence' evidence which the Prosecution intends to adduce is contained within the documents set out on the attached schedule which previously have been served upon you.

6. So far as is known to the Prosecution, particulars of the date, time, place and circumstances at or in which the conduct referred to in paragraph 5 above occurred are contained within the documents referred to in paragraph 5 above.

7. So far as is known to the Prosecution, the names of each person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the conduct referred to in paragraph 5 above are contained within the documents referred to in paragraph 5 above.""

55The schedule to the notice indicated that the material to be relied on was effectively the evidence of the taxpayers in respect of whose returns the other counts related.

56Shortly before the Crown closed its case at the trial, counsel for the appellant confirmed that he had no objection to the notice.

57The summing-up by the trial judge in relation to the issue of tendency and coincidence was in the following terms (SU 22-26):

""The Crown says that Mr Giourtalis has a tendency to prepare documents containing false information and to do other things to cause that information to become part of an income tax return. The Crown say he caused these returns to be lodged with the tax department. The Crown say that the accused has a tendency to cause income tax returns to be lodged with the ATO containing information which Mr Giourtalis knew to be false.

Further and in particular, the Crown allege that Mr Giourtalis knew the details with respect to income and tax instalment deductions were false either because he was aware that certain expenses were incorrect or that details in relation to employment were incorrect. The Crown also say that Mr Giourtalis has a tendency to cause income tax returns to be lodged with the ATO without first obtaining approval from the named tax payer and the Crown also allege that he has a tendency to cause income tax returns to be lodged with the ATO containing false references to the named taxpayer being employed either by Ladadika Pty Limited, Hird Nominees Pty Limited, Phonecian Autos Pty Limited.

In this regard, Mr Giourtalis does not deny that many of the documents he prepared were in error and he does not deny in relation to the receipt of tax refunds that the tax refund cheques went into an account controlled by him, that is Ramace Pty Limited. He has an explanation as to why that occurred and that was he says he had authorities from tax payers.

The Crown also say that in relation to some of the taxpayers who you have not heard from and Mr Crown referred to these taxpayers as the Greek taxpayers yesterday, and they are Anastasia Bouzianos count number 3, Roxani Stavrou count number 4, Georgios Tsamados count number 5, Constantina Vrakas counts number 39 and 40 and Sotirios Vrakas counts number 41 and 42. No evidence has been given by them. You will see from the DIMIA reports tendered in the volumes that you have before you, that those taxpayers are apparently not in Australia.

Now the instructions I gave you earlier relate to treating each offence and each charge separately. As such you cannot treat evidence on one matter in evidence in another matter. You cannot let the fact that Mr Giourtalis is facing fifty-seven charges prejudice you in relation to your consideration of each of these charges individually. However the Crown alleged that he has a certain tendency to behave in the way that I've just set out. They also allege that it was not a coincidence that Mr Giourtalis caused income tax returns to be lodged for the taxpayers that I have just read out, that is for sequences or counts number 3, 4, 5, 39, 40, 41 and 42.

The Crown allege that is not a coincidence that he caused income tax returns to be lodged for those taxpayers which contained false information about their income and tax instalment deductions. The Crown also say that it is not a coincidence that Mr Giourtalis lodged income tax returns for those taxpayers which contains references to the companies Ladadika Pty Limited, Hird Nominees Pty Limited and Phonecia Holdings Pty Limited. They say further that it was not a coincidence that Mr Giourtalis caused income tax returns to be lodged without first obtaining the taxpayer's signature.

Now that evidence is before you because of what the Crown says is a pattern of behaviour that reveals the accused has a tendency to act in a particular way as I have just detailed, that is the preparation of and inclusion of false information in tax returns to cause those income tax returns with false information to be lodged and to do so without the approval of tax payers and to receive the tax refunds.

You have heard Mr Giourtalis's explanation in relation to each of these taxpayers and these are all factual matters for you to decide members of the jury. My direction that I am giving you now relates to how, and only how, you can use evidence of Mr Giourtalis's evidence in relation to what the Crown says is a tendency and lack of coincidence in relation to the other counts that I have referred to, then you can only use them in relation to the specific counts that I have referred to.

You have to make two findings beyond reasonable doubt before you can use this tendency and lack of coincidence evidence. The first finding is that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts occurred. That is that Mr Giourtalis did these things that the Crown alleges that causes them to say he has a particular tendency to do things. In making that finding, you do not consider each of the acts in isolation but consider all of the evidence and ask whether you are satisfied that the particular act or the tendency relied upon, actually occurred.

You must look at the evidence in relation to each of the other taxpayers. If you cannot find that they are proved beyond reasonable doubt, then you must put aside any suggestion that the accused has the tendency advanced by the Crown. You cannot use it at all.

If you do find beyond reasonable doubt that the acts alleged by the Crown occurred, then you go on to consider a second finding. The second question you must ask yourself is whether, from the facts you found to be proven beyond reasonable doubt, (that is the acts alleged in relation to the false information alleged, the using the false information, the lodging of income tax returns) if you find that proved beyond reasonable doubt, whether you can infer or conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency to act in the way that the Crown alleges. Now I have used the word infer there because I have told you the care you must take with inferences. If you cannot daw that inference or conclusion beyond reasonable doubt, then you are to put aside the suggestion that the accused had that tendency.

The evidence must not be used by you in any other way. It would be completely wrong for you to otherwise reason that if you suggest the accused has committed one of the offences charged, that he must have committed the other offence. You have to go through the two stage process that I have told you about, that is to make findings beyond reasonable doubt in relation to whether the first set of acts complained of, occurred and then decide whether you can infer to the required standard again, that he had such a tendency to act in such a way in relation to the second group of charges.

In relation to the coincidence, it is suggested that similarities in the counts I have referred to are very similar to others. The similarities suggested are: the use of the company Ladadika, the high tax instalments, the use of lodgement of returns without tax payer approval. That evidence is before you because sometimes it may be that there is such a similarity between two different acts and circumstances that you may be satisfied that a person who did one act or set of acts must have done the other acts or set of acts. That is to say that the similarity between the two separate acts is so marked and the circumstances in which they occurred is so marked, that because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, you may use that to establish that the accused committed the second group of acts, but I repeat you can only use this pattern of behaviour if you make findings beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the first set of facts that are alleged by the Crown and you cannot use it as a general way of finding facts in relation to all of the charges, only the ones I have specifically mentioned. The others I remind you, you must consider the evidence separately on each of the charges.""

58No objection was taken to this direction.

The submissions of the parties

59In his written submissions the appellant simply asserted that the prejudice from the evidence was high and the tendency and coincidence evidence should not have been allowed. Apart from describing the evidence as incredibly prejudicial, counsel for the appellant added nothing further to the written submissions.

60The Crown pointed to the fact that the tendency and coincidence notice was not opposed and that no objection was taken to either the evidence or the directions. It submitted the admission of the evidence was a matter of discretion and no error was shown in the exercise of that discretion.

61The Crown also submitted that in relation to the counts the subject of the tendency and coincidence notice, other evidence demonstrated that the returns were false and the appellant was not entitled to retain the refunds.

62The Crown also submitted that in fact the direction assisted the appellant because it directed the jury's attention to the limited purpose for which evidence on one count could be used in relation to evidence on another.

Consideration

63It is difficult to perceive how this ground of appeal can succeed in circumstances where the tendency and coincidence notice was consented to, the evidence in question was admitted without objection and where no objection was taken to the direction of the trial judge.

64Further difficulty arises by reason of the fact that neither the ground of appeal nor the appellant's submissions identify with any clarity the nature of the error in respect of which complaint is made. Thus, it is not clear whether or not it is said that the trial judge was in error in thinking that the evidence had significant probative value (Evidence Act 1995 s 97(1)(b)), or that the probative value was substantially outweighed by any prejudicial effect (Evidence Act s 101).

65The ground of appeal can be dealt with shortly. First, as no objection was taken to the evidence it cannot be said that the trial judge was in error in admitting it: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297. Second, leaving this to one side, no error of discretion by the trial judge in admitting the evidence was identified by the appellant in his submissions. The appellant did not contend, contrary to the Crown, that the question of whether the judge fell into error was to be decided by the principles set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499: see R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim R 308 at [36]; R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; (2005) 158 A Crim R 504 at [105]; contra Basten JA in dissent on this point at [45]; Dao v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 63; (2011) 81 NSWLR 568 at [157], [167]-[173], [211], [213]; cf Spigelman CJ at [61], Allsop P at [100]; Bangaru v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 204; (2012) 297 ALR 108 at [261]-[266]; Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886; (2000) 106 FCR 51 at [74]-[75]; contra R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; (2009) 201 A Crim R 451 and PNJ v Director of Public Prosecutions [2010] VSCA 88; (2010) 27 VR 146 at [15]-[16].

66Even if the issue was to be considered by reference to the principles laid down in Warren v Coombes [1979] HCA 9; (1979) 142 CLR 531, the same result would be reached. In Dao supra Allsop P described the analysis required by s 97(1)(b) in the following terms:

""[98] The question of probative value is a question of relevance: the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. This is a matter of logical analysis in the light of the balance of posited evidence. It is a judgment or evaluation, but one by reference to a fixed clear legal standard and is not an evaluation of the kind the subject of consideration in Podrebersek, Norbis v Norbis, Singer v Berghouse or even s 7 of the Contracts Review Act. This is the case even with the addition of a qualifying adjective 'significant'. 

[99] That, however, is not the end of the enquiry. A statutory precondition is provided for in s 97(1)(b) that the court (that is the judge ruling on the admissibility) thinks something. That something is that the evidence 'will', that is looking forward, have the required quality. I do not think that that requires predicting how a jury will react to the evidence (if there is a jury), other than through the logical assessment called for by the definition of 'probative value'. What is required however, as a precondition, is that the court thinks that it will have that effect in the body of anticipated or expected evidence. In the ordinary course this is a quintessential task of a trial judge dealing with the living fabric of the trial and the evidence unfolding before him or her. 

[100] The words of the section are not 'if the evidence has significant probative value'; they are, 'unless ... the court thinks the evidence will ... have ... significant probative value'. What is to be reviewed in the appellate process is the state of mind of the court about a future hypothesis based on logical processes, including weighing of evidence in a framework of proven or assumed evidence. The appeal court is not reviewing the fact of the probative effect of the evidence; it is reviewing what the court thinks that will be. That involves an assessment as to whether the judge approached the question by reference to correct principles and whether it was open for him or her to draw the (limited) evaluative conclusion that was drawn. Review will be of the character analogous to that discussed in Shrimpton v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 4; 69 CLR 613 at 620, referred to in Dwyer v Calco Timbers at 138 [39]; and in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21; 197 CLR 611 at 651-654, though, importantly, recognising that the power the subject of review is judicial and not executive. In practice, there is likely to be little difference between this approach and the application of House v The King.""

67In the present case the effect of the tendency and coincidence notice was that in respect of Counts 3, 4, 5, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 48 the prosecution would rely on the evidence of the persons whose purported tax returns were the subject of the other counts as showing the relevant tendency or lack of coincidence. Taken in conjunction with the evidence in relation to the counts in respect of which the tendency and coincidence notice was relied upon to which I have referred in detail below, the material relied upon in the notice if proved beyond reasonable doubt would, in my opinion, have significant probative value in establishing that the insertion of the incorrect employers in the returns of Mr Elliot (Count 37), Ms Vrakas (Counts 39 and 40), Mr Vrakas (Counts 41 and 42) and Mr Nick Tsigolis (Count 48) was not the result of an honest mistake. It would also be of significant probative value in establishing in respect of all counts the subject of the tendency and coincidence notice that, to the extent the information contained in the tax returns was false, it was false to the knowledge of the appellant. It would also have significant probative value on the question of whether or not the returns the subject of the counts in question were lodged without approval from the taxpayer.

68So far as pars 2(d) and 3(g) of the notice are concerned, it was not in issue that the refund cheques were banked into an account controlled by the appellant. Further, it was ultimately not in issue that the returns lodged on behalf of the taxpayers the subject of these counts were lodged at the behest of the appellant.

69Further, in my opinion, the probative value substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect. There was no objection to joint trials on all counts. Thus the evidence relied on in the notice would have been before the jury in any event. The trial judge in her direction indicated that each charge had to be considered individually and gave a clear direction as to the limited use which could be made of the tendency and coincidence evidence. In these circumstances the prejudice arising from the use of the evidence as demonstrating tendency and lack of coincidence was limited and, in my opinion, was substantially outweighed by its probative value. The same result is reached in the application of the approach by Whealy JA in respect of coincidence evidence in DSJ v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 9; (2012) 259 FLR 262 at [78]-[80].

70It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

The effect of the misdirection

71A misdirection as to honest mistake affects all counts except Counts 25, 28, 29, 30-36 inclusive, 38, 44, 45, 51-53 inclusive, 56 and 57. Of these counts all but Counts 30-35 inclusive, 56 and 57 were affected by the Browne v Dunn direction.

72No submission was made to the effect that the misdirections caused a miscarriage of justice or otherwise impacted on those grounds of appeal to which the impugned directions did not relate.

73It follows, irrespective of the application of the proviso, that the appeal should be dismissed so far as it relates to Counts 30-35 inclusive, 56 and 57.

Do the errors in the present case preclude consideration of the proviso?

74It is well established that there are cases where errors in the summing-up or directions given by the trial judge are such that it is inappropriate to apply the proviso irrespective of the apparent strength of the Crown case. In Quartermaine v The Queen [1980] HCA 29; (1980) 143 CLR 595, the first of the cases relied on by the appellant in support of the proposition that the present was such a case, Gibbs J at 601 approved the statement of Wickham J, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the proviso would not be applied if the trial was so irregular that no proper trial had taken place in ""that there had been a serious departure from the essential requirements of the law"". His Honour referred as an example to Andrews v The Queen [1968] HCA 84; (1968) 126 CLR 198, where the accused was not in reality tried for the offence for which he was indicted. He held that the proviso could not be applied in the case before him when the jury was not asked to consider the elements of the particular offence for which the appellant was convicted: Quartermaine supra at 601.

75The appellant also relied on the well-known passage from Wilde v The Queen [1988] HCA 6; (1988) 164 CLR 365. In that case the majority, after referring to what was said by Gibbs J in Quartermaine supra, made the following remarks at 372-373:

""This view [the view expressed by Gibbs J in Quartermaine] is undoubtedly correct, for the proviso was not intended to provide, in effect, a retrial before the Court of Criminal Appeal when the proceedings before the primary court have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all. It is one thing to apply the proviso to prevent the administration of the criminal law from being 'plunged into outworn technicality' (the phrase of Barwick C.J. in Driscoll v. The Queen; it is another to uphold a conviction after a proceeding which is fundamentally flawed, merely because the appeal court is of the opinion that on a proper trial the appellant would inevitably have been convicted. The proviso has no application where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. If that has occurred, then it can be said, without considering the effect of the irregularity upon the jury's verdict, that the accused has not had a proper trial and that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Errors of that kind may be so radical or fundamental that by their very nature they exclude the application of the proviso: see Reg. v. Hildebrandt; Reg. v. Henderson; Reg. v. Couper.""
(Citations omitted)

76Their Honours went on to say that there was no rigid formula to determine what constituted such a radical or fundamental error.

77In support of the proposition that the present case was one which fell into the categories of cases referred to in the passage from Wilde supra cited above, the appellant relied on three other cases. The first was S v The Queen [1989] HCA 66; (1989) 168 CLR 266, in which the accused was charged with three counts of carnal knowledge, each occurring within specified 12 month periods. The complainant gave evidence of two specific acts of intercourse during the specified period and numerous other acts over a two year period. It was held that in the absence of identification of the acts charged, the Crown could not lead evidence equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences any one of which might constitute the offence. The majority, following Wilde supra, held that it was not an appropriate case to apply the proviso. Dawson J held that the accused was reduced to a general denial and was unable to raise specific defences such as alibi defences which related to each particular offence charged. He also pointed out that individual jurors may have selected different occasions as constituting the offence. In these circumstances his Honour held that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice precluding the application of the proviso. Toohey J and Gaudron and McHugh JJ in separate judgments reached the same conclusion for substantially the same reasons: S v The Queen supra at 282-283, 287-288.

78The appellant also relied on Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250, which involved a judge alone trial for certain sexual offences. Section 33 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 required the judge in those circumstances to indicate in his judgment the principles of law applied and the findings of fact made, and to take into account any warning which would have been given to a jury. If the case had been tried by a jury the trial judge would have been required to have given a warning to the jury in the terms set out in Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79. The trial judge failed to have regard to this requirement or to record it. The Court in a joint judgment said it was an inappropriate case for the application of the proviso. Their Honours made the following remarks:

""[39] With respect to the application of the proviso, it has been held in this Court that not every wrong decision on a question of law will lead to the quashing of the conviction or a new trial and that '[t]here is no rigid formula to determine what constitutes such a radical or fundamental error' as to preclude the application of the proviso. There may be cases where the failure to satisfy the requirements of s 33 involves errors that are so trivial that the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude that there has been a trial according to law, notwithstanding that failure. However, given the importance of the subject matter of the warning demanded by this case, the miscarriage of justice was a substantial one. This was not a case for the application of the proviso.""
(Citations omitted)

79None of these cases involved a misdirection regarding the onus of proof. In that context the appellant relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Soto-Sanchez [2002] NSWCCA 160; (2002) 129 A Crim R 279 where, in the context of a short summing-up, the trial judge gave the following direction:

""We must be very wary of the risk of the entrapment of an innocent man. So is there a chance that the police accidentally got the wrong person. So could it be that he did come innocently to assist to [sic] two apparent strangers who appeared to come into the country the previous night with a large quantity of prohibited drugs. At the end of all your analysis of the evidence, is the only reasonable or credible explanation the guilt of the accused, namely he had the drugs when he walked out of the room and he knew he had them. Or could there be another explanation. Is there a reasonable chance on the balance of probabilities that what the accused said in his record of interview that he was merely coming to the Furama Hotel to take the people there out to see the town or to meet other people. Because if so then you must have a reasonable doubt and the accused must be acquitted.""

80The Court unanimously held that there was a real possibility that this direction reversed the onus of proof and had the effect of restricting the jury in considering reasonable doubt in relation to the prosecution evidence. Stein JA also observed that the impugned direction was virtually the last advice given to the jury. He concluded this was a fundamental error that went to the root of the trial: R v Soto-Sanchez supra at [20]-[22].

81In an earlier decision, MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348, the accused was convicted of making a false statement on oath. It was held that the trial judge erred in not acceding to a request to redirect the jury that in considering whether the accused knew his statements were false or lacked a belief they were true, the prosecution would not have established an essential ingredient of the offence charged if they were satisfied that the accused held a mistaken but genuine belief that the statements were true. The Court held that it was inappropriate to apply the proviso as the accused had lost a chance of an acquittal which was fairly open if the jury concluded that ""his dogmatic evidence, although false, was incorrectly or mistakenly so"": MacKenzie supra at 376.

82Not all misdirections even of a serious nature will lead to the conclusion that the proviso cannot be applied. In Glennon v The Queen [1994] HCA 7; (1994) 179 CLR 1 the trial judge directed the jury that although the accused's right to silence could not be used in a manner adverse to him, it could be used to test the veracity of his evidence. The majority at 8, referring to Wilde supra, emphasised that there was ""no mechanical formula or rigid test"" to be applied in determining whether an error goes to the root of the proceedings; each case will depend on its own circumstances. They further stated that in dealing with the question it is appropriate to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error. The majority held that in the circumstances, the error was not of such a nature as to render consideration of the proviso inapplicable, although they ultimately held that it should not be applied.

83In Krakouer v The Queen [1998] HCA 43; (1998) 194 CLR 202, the Court held that a misdirection in respect of a provision in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (WA) deeming the accused as having intent to sell or supply a prohibited drug was a misdirection as it had not been established that he had the requisite quantity in his possession for the deeming provision to apply. The Court also held it was a misdirection as the deeming provision was irrelevant to the offences of attempt and conspiracy. However, a majority of the Court held that the misdirection did not go the root of the proceedings and did not result in the trial being fundamentally flawed. The majority made the following comments:

""[22] Reduced to its essentials, the first branch of the appellant's argument concerning the proviso was that because the misdirection concerned proof of an element of each of the offences with which the appellant was charged, and because the misdirection occurred at a point when the appellant had no opportunity to address the jury about it, the appellant had been denied a proper trial. Especially was this so, so the argument ran, when the misdirection included a reversal of the onus of proof. 

[23] We do not accept that the proceedings against the appellant were fundamentally flawed or 'have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all'. Each of the matters which we have mentioned (the fact that the misdirection concerned an element of the offence, occurred at the end of the trial and reversed the onus of proof) may invite the most careful attention to whether the proviso can be applied; each of these matters may be said to suggest that the jury may have been led into a false or unsafe chain of reasoning. But we are not persuaded that the fact that there has been a misdirection about one element of the offence with which an accused is charged means that the trial was necessarily fundamentally flawed. After all, most cases of misdirection will concern directions about matters relevant to the jury's deliberations and yet the proviso requires that not every 'wrong decision of any question of law' lead to the quashing of the conviction or a new trial. As was said in Wilde v The Queen '[t]here is no rigid formula to determine what constitutes such a radical or fundamental error' as to preclude the application of the proviso. Simply demonstrating that there was a misdirection on a matter relevant to the jury's consideration is not sufficient.

[24] It may be that a misdirection which has the effect of denying procedural fairness and depriving an accused person of the right to have some substantial part of his or her case decided by the jury would result in a trial that is fundamentally flawed. It may also be that a misdirection about burden of proof invites closer scrutiny of the question whether the trial was fundamentally flawed but in this case it is important to put the particular misdirection into the whole context of the trial. It is convenient to do that at the same time as considering the second branch of the appellant's argument about the proviso, that the appellant lost a real chance of acquittal.""

84More recent cases have emphasised three matters. First, it is a necessary but not always a sufficient pre-condition for the operation of the proviso that the appellate court be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the guilt of the accused. If the court is not satisfied of that matter it cannot conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred: Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [44]; Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [226]; Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; (2007) 235 CLR 521 at [41]-[42]; AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438 at [53]. In considering this matter the court is performing essentially the same function as when it decides whether a jury verdict should be set aside as unreasonable: Weiss supra at [41]; Festa supra at [123]; Darkan v The Queen [2006] HCA 34; (2006) 227 CLR 373 at [84].

85Second, the court's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict: Weiss supra at [43]; Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; (2008) 236 CLR 358 at [128]-[130]. As a corollary, if the appellate court is unable to conclude the basis upon which a jury reached its verdict or if the jury did so without consideration of whether essential elements of the offence were proved beyond reasonable doubt, it could not be said that a substantial miscarriage of justice did not occur: see Patel v The Queen [2012] HCA 29; (2012) 86 ALJR 954 at [126]-[128].

86Third, in Weiss the Court emphasised that there was no universally applicable criteria as to when it would be inappropriate for a court to apply the proviso even though it was satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt: Weiss supra at [45]. In Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 225 ALR 161, Gleeson CJ, whilst emphasising that it was undesirable to seek to reduce miscarriages of justice to a simple formula, stated that circumstances when it was inappropriate to apply the proviso might include cases where the failure of process was such as to deprive the appellate court of the capacity to justly assess the strength of the case against the appellant, or if there had been a failure to adhere to the conditions essential to a satisfactory trial: Nudd supra at [6]; see also AK v Western Australia supra at [23] (per Gleeson CJ and Kiefel J albeit in dissent); Handlen v The Queen [2011] HCA 51; (2011) 245 CLR 282 at [47].

87An example of the first class of case referred to by Gleeson CJ is Evans supra. In that case the High Court confirmed that the trial judge had erred by refusing to admit alibi evidence and held that the proviso could not be applied in such circumstances. In their judgment, Gummow and Hayne JJ emphasised that as an important element of material (the alibi evidence) was excluded and necessarily untested at the trial, the Court of Criminal Appeal could not decide on the record whether the offences were proved beyond reasonable doubt: Evans supra at [48]. 

88In AK v Western Australia supra, Gummow and Hayne JJ warned against treating what was said in Wilde supra as a judicially determined exception grafted onto the otherwise general words of the statute: AK v Western Australia supra at [54]. Subsequently in Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; (2008) 236 CLR 293, Gummow and Hayne JJ again emphasised this point, making the following remarks:

""[17] The Court also pointed out in Weiss that the use of the word 'substantial' in the proviso to the common form appeal provision (no substantial miscarriage of justice) was more than mere ornamentation. The expression 'substantial miscarriage' was adopted to make plain that the common form appeal provision did away with the old Exchequer rule by which any departure from trial according to law, regardless of its nature or importance, entitled the accused to a new trial. But whether there has been a 'substantial miscarriage' at any trial will depend, as was also pointed out in Weiss, upon the particular facts and circumstances and '[n]o single universally applicable description of what constitutes 'no substantial miscarriage of justice' can be given'. 

...

[33] Identifying a priori some kinds of error as precluding application of the proviso presents difficulties of the same kind as are presented by using judicial statements about the application of the proviso as some substitute for the relevant statutory test. That is, it is neither possible nor useful to seek to apply the proviso according to a taxonomy of errors at trial which describes some as 'fundamental' and others as not. And what was said in Wilde v The Queen about 'such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings' is not to be understood as prescribing or defining a class of cases to which the proviso cannot be applied. Rather, what was said in the passage quoted from Wilde is a description, in words other than the statutory words, of one kind of case in which an appellate court could not conclude that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice. For the reasons given in Weiss, a negative proposition of this kind cannot be taken as a substitute for the statutory language. 

[34] Whether the error constituted by giving the impugned instructions is properly described as 'fundamental' or as an error going 'to the root of the proceedings' would depend upon the content that is given to the expressions used. The statutory question is whether the Full Court considers that 'no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred'. In answering that question it is necessary to consider the nature of the error and in doing that it will be important to consider the possible effect that the error may have had on the outcome of the trial.""

89In Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; (2012) 246 CLR 92 at [21]-[24] the plurality stated that it was neither possible nor useful to argue about the proviso by reference to some category of ""fundamental defects"". The plurality stated that the question posed was whether there had been a ""substantial miscarriage of justice"": see also Patel v The Queen supra at [126].

90What emerges from these authorities is the need to focus on whether, in the particular circumstances which existed, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. As the review of the trial and the evidence which I have carried out below indicates, if this is a case where the proviso can properly be applied, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. However, irrespective of this matter, it is necessary to consider whether there was a substantial miscarriage of justice such that the proviso cannot be applied.

91If the direction given by the primary judge as to honest and reasonable mistake had stood alone, I would have had little difficulty in concluding that regardless of the strength of the Crown case there would have been a substantial miscarriage of justice. The direction was quite incorrect and could only have misled the jury. More significantly, it would have inevitably diverted the members of the jury from the tasks assigned to them, namely to consider whether the Crown had established a critical element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. In these circumstances, an appellate court would be unable to place any weight on the verdict of the jury or be satisfied that absent the erroneous direction the jury, regardless of the apparent strength of the Crown case, would have entered a verdict of guilty against the appellant.

92However, the erroneous direction did not stand alone. It must be considered in the context where the Crown asserted that it was an essential part of its case that the jury should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to defraud the Commonwealth. Counsel for the Crown in his summing-up made the following remarks:

""The Crown has to do more than that. We have to prove that Mr Giourtalis deprived the Commonwealth of that money, and he did so intentionally, that is, this wasn't an accident, or to use his words, it's an honest mistake, he intentionally defrauded the tax office.""

93Counsel for the appellant at the trial expressly adopted these remarks:

""I would like to remind you of what my friend indicated was relevant from the outset and that's the presumption of innocence and also the onus of proof. In other words the accused doesn't have to prove anything, it's for the Crown to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that burden rests on the Crown from beginning to end of the case until you deliver your verdict.""

94It was in that context that the trial judge came to sum-up.

95In her written directions the trial judge emphasised that one of the elements of the offence was to intentionally deprive the Commonwealth of money. Her Honour made a similar direction with respect to the counts on the indictment alleging attempt to defraud. At the outset of her summing-up she repeated that direction. Further, as I indicated at par [26] above, after giving the direction complained of she returned to the appellant's evidence, referring to the fact that he said that ""at worst he made some honest mistakes about including some taxpayers on the wrong spreadsheet"". She then emphasised that it was not a matter where the jury could convict on the basis that one version of the events should be preferred over another. She expressly stated that if the appellant's version left the jury in some doubt as to whether the Crown proved its case in relation to a particular count, a verdict of not guilty should be entered. She further emphasised that it was only if the jury came to the conclusion that the account given by the accused could not reasonably be true that they should return a verdict of guilty.

96As I have indicated below, in my opinion the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. Whilst as I have stated that is not necessarily a sufficient basis for finding that there was not a substantial miscarriage of justice, it does not seem to me that the impugned direction of itself leads to the conclusion that such a substantial miscarriage of justice occurred. The jury were directed correctly as to the elements of the offences. The concluding remarks by the trial judge made it clear to the jury that it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant's version could not be accepted. It was a necessary precondition to a finding against the appellant that his evidence was not accepted by the jury both in relation to the charges where mistake was alleged and in relation to the other charges. In these circumstances any confusion brought about by the direction as to honest and reasonable mistake does not mean it is not possible to assess the basis on which the jury reached its verdict. If it was inevitable that a verdict of guilty would be reached on a correct application of the onus, then in my opinion in the circumstances of this case it would follow that there was not a substantial miscarriage of justice.

97I am fortified in this view by one further matter. The only type of mistake which the appellant said he made was that he misdescribed the name of the employer of various taxpayers. In each case where he stated that that misdescription arose, he contended that the other information in the taxation returns was correct. For fraud or attempt to defraud to be established it was necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that those figures which the appellant said were true were in fact false and known by the appellant to be false. It would not be enough for it to be established simply that the wrong employer was inserted in the returns. The critical material in the returns were the figures which led to the refunds or the assertion of entitlement to a refund. The appellant did not suggest these figures were inserted in returns as a result of a mistake and the directions made it clear that their falsity and the appellant's knowledge of such falsity had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

98The error in respect of the Browne v Dunn direction does not affect the position. Such a misdirection, which at most would lead to the jury taking into account matters relating to the credit of the appellant which should not have been taken into account, does not mean that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice if after taking into account all evidence properly admissible, it was inevitable that the appellant would have been convicted. 

99It follows that the proviso should be applied if taking into account all evidence properly admissible the appellant would have been found guilty.

Would the appellant have inevitably been found guilty on the evidence properly admitted against him?

(a) General matters

100A number of general matters may be noted at the outset.

101First, the case unsurprisingly was substantially a documentary case. The Crown prepared and tendered at the trial a summary document showing in respect of each count details of the returns lodged on behalf of the various clients of the appellant together with documents obtained from the appellant, Mr Campos and Messrs Lopez and Gonzalez by either the ATO or the Australian Federal Police (the summary). 

102The appellant accepted that the summary was accurate. As a consequence it is not necessary to go beyond the summary in relation to much of the evidence which was tendered at the trial.

103Second, although the appellant accepted that the summary was correct, he contended that various documents had gone missing from his office from about the time the documents were seized by either the ATO or the Australian Federal Police (AFP). In assessing the appellant's evidence it is necessary to have regard to the evidence given as to such search and seizure.

104Mr Scott Sykes, an AFP Agent, gave evidence that he was involved in the execution of a search warrant on 2 July 2003 at the appellant's property. He stated that the search warrant included documents relevant to an investigation to be carried out in relation to the appellant, Mr Campos, Mr Gonzalez, Mr Lopez, Mr Filocamo, Ramace and all the taxpayers listed in the summary with the exception of Mr Theologou, who was referred to in the warrant as Mr Gregorakis.

105Mr Sykes said that at the same time a search warrant was being executed at the appellant's home. He said that he and other officers waited in the reception area of the office of Ramace until the appellant arrived. He said that when the appellant arrived he commenced to type on the keyboard of his computer and he was requested to stop doing this. He stated that at that point in time no police officer or computer expert had accessed his computer.

106Mr Sykes said that he later saw the appellant at the front reception desk of the office sitting in front of a computer with a keyboard and typing. Mr Sykes said he told him again to cease using his computer. He said the appellant explained to him that he was making a sign for the front door. Mr Sykes said at that stage a handwritten sign had already been prepared.

107Mr Sykes stated that he recalled having some discussions with Mr Clinton Towers, the computer forensics officer assigned to the investigation, concerning documents which had been deleted from the computer. He said that he recalled having a conversation with the appellant concerning such deletions but he could not recall if the appellant offered any explanation.

108Mr Sykes said that items which were seized were recorded on a property seizure record showing the location of the document, when it was seized and where and by whom it was seized. He agreed that the property seizure record was signed by the appellant at the conclusion of the search. He said that the documents were then taken back to the AFP office and placed in the exhibits room.

109In cross-examination Mr Sykes agreed that he had no recollection of any of the particular documents seized.

110A warrant was also executed at the office of Messrs Lopez and Gonzalez on 2 July 2003. The agent responsible for executing that warrant, a Ms Lyndall Rimoldi, gave evidence of adopting a procedure similar to that adopted by Mr Sykes. She stated the property seizure record was signed by Mr Lopez and the documents were taken back to the office of the AFP and placed in the exhibits room. She also gave evidence that she had no recollection of any particular document seized.

111Similar evidence was given by a Mr Dominic Zappavigna, the AFP agent responsible for executing a warrant at Mr Filocamo's Burwood office on 2 July 2003.

112Mr Scott Miller gave evidence to the effect that he was the AFP agent responsible for the execution of a warrant at the appellant's home in Brighton Le Sands on 2 July 2003. He said that Agent Clinton Towers dealt with computer forensics. Mr Miller said he did not do anything in relation to the appellant's home computer. He stated that the only material seized at the appellant's home was a black floppy disk. He confirmed that a property seizure record was signed by the appellant and that the floppy disk was taken to a secure exhibits room at Police headquarters.

113Mr Miller was cross-examined as to a bundle of documents referred to in a statement he made and which he said were in a manila folder on a cabinet located alongside the desk in the office of the appellant. He said that was material which was located at the office of Ramace which was handed to a Mr MacAlister who was the property seizure officer in respect of the search warrant relating to the Ramace premises.

114Mr Jeffrey Cukon gave evidence as to the execution of a warrant at the premises of Mr Campos on 2 July 2003 in similar terms to the evidence of Mr Sykes and Ms Rimoldi. 

115The computer forensics expert involved in the execution of the warrants, Mr Towers, gave evidence. He stated that he had a Bachelor of Computer Science with First Class Honours from the University of Technology in Sydney together with a Bachelor of Economics degree and a Diploma in Information Technology. He stated that he attended the business premises of Ramace and the appellant's home in connection with the execution of the warrants. He stated that at the business premises there were five computers on a network in the office, which were able to share files and communicate with each other.

116Mr Towers described the technique he used to copy material stored on the computers. He described the precautions he took so as not to change any of the data on the hard drives and the establishment of a write protection device, the purpose of which was to prevent any changes in data. He said once that was done using forensic software, all the data whether currently in use or anything marked for deletion by the user was copied.

117Mr Towers stated that his investigation established that the time recorded on the appellant's computer as being the time marking the creation, modification or accessing of documents was accurate. He explained that in a Windows operating system deleted documents were removed to a recycle bin. Once documents were removed from the recycle bin they could not be restored without the use of special software or special expertise.

118Mr Towers gave evidence that he recalled looking at the appellant's computer and noted that there were large numbers of files which were shown as having been deleted on that day. He stated that he did not know if any particular analysis was conducted in relation to these files. 

119Mr Towers gave evidence that the computer in the appellant's office had a bottom hard drive, a middle hard drive and a top hard drive. He stated that he connected the blocking protection device referred to earlier in his evidence to that computer and then mirrored the contents of the three hard drives and burnt them onto a number of DVDs which were secured in the exhibits room. He said he adopted a similar process in relation to the other computers in the appellant's office, with the exception of one computer, the hard drive of which was searched but not copied.

120Mr Towers also gave evidence that the computer and laptop referred to in the summary were seized from the appellant's office and placed in the exhibits room.

121In cross-examination Mr Towers acknowledged that documents could be deleted either by the user or by an automatic process. He said, however, that he could not be sure if the documents were deleted on the date of execution of the warrant or on the date of last access.

122Evidence was also given by a Ms Maggie Ng, a forensics and computer expert employed by the ATO. She stated she received a number of DVDs in about April 2005. She analysed them by using computer forensic software to view the discs and she performed keyword searches to identify files. She said the keyword searches related to names contained on the various search warrants. 

123Ms Ng was shown a document entitled 'Statement of Facts Summary' which became Exhibit AP at the trial (Exhibit AP). She said that she searched the names of the taxpayers shown in Exhibit AP together with company names including Ladadika, Churchill Precision Grinding Pty Ltd (Churchill Precision Grinding), Hird Nominees, Phoenicia, One Shop, Master Auto Trim, European Enterprises, Hilton Glass Pty Ltd (Hilton Glass) and Chalmers. She said she extracted the relevant files on disc for viewing by a Mr Geoffrey Williams, the case officer. She explained that by relevant files she meant files that showed some hits for the relevant search terms.

124A Mr Peter Silk, formerly of the ATO, gave evidence that on 3 July 2003 he took possession of the materials seized as a result of the execution of the search warrants. He said he took the materials to the Newcastle ATO office where they were signed into the evidence room of that office where they remained until he reviewed them. He stated that he remained the case officer in relation to the matter until January 2004 when that role was taken over by Mr Williams.

125Mr Williams, who described his occupation as a fraud investigator with the ATO, gave evidence that he took over consideration of the matters the subject of these proceedings from Mr Silk in January 2004. He gave evidence that he created the document that became Exhibit AP.

126What is important from this evidence is that it was not suggested to any of the officers concerned in the search, seizure or analysis that any documents were destroyed in the course of the search or inadvertently deleted from the appellant's computers. Nor was it suggested that any of the documents seized were subsequently lost or deleted.

127Third, there was no significant dispute at the trial as to the manner in which tax returns for the various clients of the appellant came to be lodged. The primary information to lodge the tax returns was collected by the appellant who passed that information on to Mr Campos. Mr Campos then checked that the profit and loss statements and group certificates were in the correct form and passed them on to Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez who would prepare the tax returns. Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez, having prepared the returns, would pass them to Mr Filocamo who would then electronically lodge the tax returns. 

128The appellant gave evidence concerning this arrangement. His evidence was that he worked as an accountant for Ramace in 1998 to 2000. He said that he used to obtain work by word of mouth or through another firm of accountants, Hall Chadwick. He stated that Hall Chadwick was the liquidator or administrator of Ladadika, Hird Nominees, One Shop, Chalmers, Churchill, Hilton Glass, European Enterprises, AAANG and Dannoui Holdings Pty Ltd (Dannoui Holdings).

129He stated that his involvement with individual clients was generally in relation to loans. He said that he did not tell any of his clients that he was a tax agent, but rather, that he had an association with Mr Campos and that he could prepare their returns. He said in respect of all loans made to clients that there was a loan agreement.

130The appellant gave evidence that he was aware from the outset that Mr Campos had an association with Mr Filocamo. However, he only found out about the involvement of Messrs Lopez and Gonzalez in late 1999. He stated that at least to his belief, Mr Campos prepared the tax returns and gave him a paper copy.

131He said it was his standard practice to ask clients if they wanted to apply some or all of the tax refunds to their outstanding loans. He stated that once refunds were received he would call the client to tell them of the refund.

132He stated that he had no hand in preparing the tax returns. He understood Mr Campos was preparing the returns, then printing them and bringing them to him for his client's signatures. He stated that in all cases he received paper returns which he would get clients to come in and sign. He stated that he then explained the refund that the client would receive.

133He said that his practice was to get each taxpayer to sign an Appointment of Tax Agent form. As far as he understood, the form, which he gave to Mr Campos, appointed Mr Filocamo to act on their behalf as their tax agent.

134In cross-examination, the appellant said that prior to the arrangement with Mr Filocamo and Mr Campos, he had a similar arrangement with a Mr Nick Skoulos. He stated that he was very familiar with group certificates and tax returns and that the relationship between client and accountant was one of honesty and accuracy. He acknowledged that his clients relied on him to prepare documents to be used in tax returns and that he had an increased duty when acting for clients with literacy difficulties, who were not sophisticated financially or who were just starting a business.

135He stated that from the outset he knew that Mr Campos was not a tax agent and that Mr Campos was going to use another accountant to lodge the returns based on documents which he prepared. He accepted that Messrs Campos, Gonzalez, Lopez and Filocamo did not have any direct contact with his clients.

136Mr Campos gave evidence that he met the appellant in around 1992 and that he set up his practice, Marrickville Accounting Services, in late 1994. He stated that he knew Mr Lopez who told him he had contact with a tax agent. He then arranged to become part of a system so that the agent could lodge his clients' returns electronically. He stated that he meet Mr Filocamo only once.

137Mr Campos stated the arrangement with the appellant started sometime in 1998. He did not have any direct contact with the appellant's clients. He said the appellant gave him all the necessary documents including profit and loss statements and group certificates together with signed electronic lodgement declarations, but not signed income tax returns.

138Mr Campos said that he was familiar with the term 'replacement group certificate' and he had asked the appellant about replacement certificates. He said that the appellant explained to him that the companies to which the replacement certificates related were in liquidation and that he passed this information on to Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez. He stated that he had noted that the rate at which tax had been deducted was high and that the appellant told him that the employees had not provided tax file numbers.

139Mr Campos also accepted the losses said to have been incurred by the appellant's clients. He assumed that as an accountant the appellant was doing his job properly. 

140Mr Campos stated that he never played a role in banking refund cheques for the appellant's clients and did not know what the appellant did with the funds. He said he did not know anything about Ladadika, Churchill Precision Grinding or the other companies listed in Exhibit AP.

141Mr Gonzalez gave evidence that he and Mr Lopez had reached an agreement with Mr Filocamo pursuant to which Mr Filocamo would lodge tax returns prepared by them for a small fee. He stated that in about 1997 Mr Campos proposed that he and Mr Lopez prepare tax returns from documents supplied by Mr Campos. He stated that the tax returns prepared contained his and Mr Lopez's Canley Vale post office box address (Canley Vale PO Box). He stated that neither he nor Mr Lopez opened mail in respect of Mr Campos' clients, but rather, they contacted Mr Campos who would come to their premises to collect the material.

142Mr Gonzalez said that he noticed on some occasions the tax instalments deducted from Mr Campos' clients was at a high rate but as he recalled it he accepted the explanation proffered by Mr Campos.

143The evidence of Mr Lopez was broadly to the same effect as that of Mr Gonzalez.

144Mr Filocamo confirmed that he lodged income tax returns on behalf of Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez pursuant to the arrangement described in the evidence above. He stated that his practice was to check the returns prepared by them with the source documents which he received and that he probably spent about five to 10 minutes on each return. He stated that up until July 2001 he had not heard of either the appellant or Mr Campos. He stated that his understanding was that all the taxpayers were clients of Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez. He agreed he was probably receiving about $4.00 per return.

145Mr Filocamo said he was not involved in receiving notices of assessment or refund cheques as he believed that Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez were dealing with those matters. He stated he did not know if the cheques were passed on to clients. He agreed that the documents he lodged contained the Canley Vale PO Box. He considered it to be his Canley Vale branch office as it was the postal address of Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez.

146It is convenient to deal with other evidence which relates generally to taxpayers during the course of the consideration of each individual count.

147Although generally I will deal with the counts in the order in which they appeared on the indictment, it is convenient to deal with the counts on which tendency and coincidence evidence is relied upon after all other counts have been dealt with. As set out above, the counts in respect of which the notice was relied upon are Counts 3, 4, 5, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 48.

(b) Ladadika Pty Ltd

148It is convenient at this point to say something in relation to Ladadika. The evidence established that Ladadika for a brief period operated a Greek nightclub. Ladadika was incorporated on 17 June 1997 and was placed into liquidation on 24 March 1998, the liquidator being a Mr Geoffrey McDonald who gave evidence that he was at the time a partner of Hall Chadwick, which he described as a liquidation firm. 

149Mr McDonald gave evidence that he was introduced to the appellant in about 1990 and in the 1990s the appellant started to refer clients to him.

150Mr McDonald stated that as liquidator of Ladadika his primary source of instructions and documents was the appellant. He stated that it was normal for a liquidator to receive the company's books and records and in some cases group certificates may not have been issued. He said he did not deal with the directors of Ladadika. 

151He said by the time of his appointment Ladadika had ceased trading. He said he received replacement group certificates in respect of employees of Ladadika from the appellant. He accepted them as correct as he had no way of verifying the information. From these group certificates he prepared statements of earnings for the persons named in them. He said he discussed the high rate of deductions and the appellant explained to him that the employees were either employed on a second job or had not provided tax file number details and, therefore, were taxed at a higher rate. He said it was unusual but plausible due to the nature of the industry.

152A Mr Unal Ibrahim gave evidence. He stated that he owned a coffee shop ""La Fresca"" at Wynyard Station. He stated that when he sold that business the appellant arranged for him to invest money from the sale of ""La Fresca"" into Ladadika. Mr Ibrahim said he understood that a Mr Con Giannakarous was the owner of Ladadika.

153Mr Ibrahim said he gave the appellant a cheque for $50,000 and that the appellant said he would arrange the papers in respect of the investment.

154Mr Ibrahim said he worked as the Manager of Ladadika. He said he could not recall the exact date but it was between late July and September 1997.

155He said that shortly after he arrived the bills for the business began to pile up. He said there were bills for gas and electricity supplies, liquor, meat and vegetable supplies, and the singers and persons who worked there. He said Mr Giannakarous did not pay anything. He said that a week after he started work Mr Giannakarous left the club and went to Greece. Mr Ibrahim said he had to pay $57,000 to clear the expenses.

156Mr Ibrahim said he paid all the employees of Ladadika from his pocket because the club did not make any money. He said he remembered that he paid cash to four singers, two men and two women, a chef and three waiters, who he named as Lambros, Lagomigis and George.

157Mr Ibrahim said some three months after he started work at the club there was a fight outside it. Following the fight there was bad publicity and, as a result, the business rapidly deteriorated and ultimately shut down shortly before Christmas 1997.

158Mr Ibrahim said he did not know anything about the incorporation of Ladadika or it going into liquidation. He said he did not get any of the $108,000 he invested back and he did not draw a wage from Ladadika.

159Mr Ibrahim said he did not play any role in obtaining tax file numbers from employees of the club. He said that the appellant was looking after those matters. He said he did not give any group certificates to any employees and he did not know about any tax being deducted from their wages before they were paid. He said he did not know whether the appellant gave the employees any group certificates. 

160Mr Ibrahim was asked whether the persons referred to in the summary as having worked for Ladadika in fact worked there. Generally speaking he denied that they did or had no recollection. That evidence has relatively little relevance to the proceedings as the appellant accepted that most of the people concerned did not work for Ladadika. To the extent it is relevant, I will return to it when I deal with the individual counts.

161In his evidence in chief the appellant said that Ladadika and certain other businesses for which he acted were cash businesses. He said if they got into difficulty he advised the directors to put the company into administration. He said he had a working association with Hall Chadwick and Mr McDonald who he would advise if a company wanted to go into administration. The appellant said he referred Ladadika to Mr McDonald. He said that in the case of Ladadika he received all the paperwork from the administrator and he finalised the books and records and prepared schedules. He said he would enter the data on a spreadsheet and from there would prepare documents including replacement group certificates.

162The appellant identified in general terms the errors which he stated he made in respect of those spreadsheets. He stated that he would have mistakenly put employees not working for Ladadika under the Ladadika heading on the spreadsheet instead of under another company, for example, Hird Nominees. He said in respect of Ladadika there was a wages book but not everybody was in there. He said he had to rely on the directors of Ladadika in particular Mr Giannakarous to complete the records.

Count 1 - Mr Theo Katsantoni - Tax return for the year ended 30 June 1997

(a) The summary

163The summary discloses that a tax return for the year ended 30 June 1997 was lodged on behalf of Mr Katsantoni on 3 July 1998, the contact address being the Canley Vale PO Box. The return disclosed that Ladadika was Mr Katsantoni's employer and that he received income of $21,141 from which tax instalments of $9,936.51 were deducted. It also claimed a loss of $9,162 incurred in carrying on a business ""T Rex Art, Graphic Art"". The summary also shows that a refund of $5,449.52 was received and deposited into the account of Ramace on 30 September 1998.

164The summary also shows that a replacement group certificate for Mr Katsantoni showing wages and tax as detailed in the return was obtained from the premises of Ramace. It should be noted that the period of employment was said to be from 1 April 1997 to 30 June 1997, Ladadika only having been incorporated on 17 June of that year. Copies of the notice of assessment giving details of the refund payable to Mr Katsantoni were also obtained from the office of the appellant. The summary also states that there was retrieved from the appellant's computer a document entitled ""Statement for Katsantoni 1997 Graphic Artist"" showing gross income of $12,884, expenses of $22,045 and net loss of $9,161.

(b) The evidence

165Mr Katsantoni gave evidence. He said that in 1997 he established and worked in a business called T-Rex Art and that a Mr Peter Sweeney offered to put money into his business if his tax issues were taken care of. He said that Mr Sweeney paid $25,000 into his business.

166He said he met the appellant in June or July 1997 and told him that his tax affairs were a complete mess. He said he indicated to the appellant that he was happy to go along with whatever the appellant suggested.

167Mr Katsantoni stated that he gave the appellant his tax file number and all documents including bank statements and that the appellant told him that $14,000 would cover everything. He said he paid the appellant $14,000 out of money that Mr Sweeney had agreed to put into his business.

168He said that the appellant never showed him any tax returns and never discussed any tax refunds with him. He stated that from 1997 until he went to America in 2002 he never heard anything about his taxation affairs from the appellant. He stated that he demanded his papers back in 2002.

169Mr Katsantoni stated that he never worked for Ladadika, that he had never heard of Mr Campos, Mr Lopez, Mr Gonzalez or Mr Filocamo and he knew nothing about the Canley Vale PO Box shown on the 1997 tax return.

170He denied that he received any wages from Ladadika or that any tax was deducted.

171Mr Katsantoni acknowledged that he carried on a business named T-Rex Art but said he did not know if the business income of $12,884 disclosed on the return was correct. However, he said that the rental expenses of $7,508 shown on the profit and loss statement was incorrect, as he did not pay rent to anybody. 

172Subsequently in the evidence, Mr Katsantoni stated that after he first saw the appellant, the appellant told him he was opening a new Greek club in Belmore. He said he thought the appellant mentioned a partner was taking it over, renaming it Ladadika and that he was asked to design a logo for which he was paid about $200. He stated that was the only work he ever did for Ladadika. He did not say whether this work was carried out in the 1997 or 1998 year.

173Mr Katsantoni was shown the notice of assessment for the year ended 30 June 1997. He denied ever having seen it and did not know he was entitled to a refund. He said he thought the payment of $14,000 made to the appellant would bring him back to zero and ""that was it"".

174Mr Katsantoni was shown a document containing his signature authorising the refund to be deposited into a Ramace account. He said he had no recollection of signing the document. He acknowledged that he borrowed some money from the appellant between 1998 and 2001, one loan being for $4,000 and the other for a computer. He stated he repaid both loans.

175In cross-examination Mr Katsantoni acknowledged that he caused the company T-Rex Art Pty Ltd to be incorporated in June 1997 and that he and Mr Sweeney agreed that he would draw a wage from the company. It was suggested to him that of the $25,000 he received from Mr Sweeney, $14,000 was paid to the appellant to finalise his tax affairs and the remaining $11,000 was wages from T-Rex Art Pty Ltd. He denied that.

176It was ultimately put to Mr Katsantoni that he did not work for Ladadika in the year ended 30 June 1997 but for T-Rex Art Pty Ltd. He said he did not remember getting a group certificate from T-Rex Art Pty Ltd for the 1997 financial year.

177Mr Katsantoni acknowledged that he could have signed an employment declaration form and stated that he did not remember if he signed a 1997 tax return in the presence of the appellant. He said he did not recall the appellant giving him an opportunity to review his tax returns or get a copy. He stated that he had difficulty getting records back. He said he did not agree to have a refund cheque deposited into Ramace's account to offset bookkeeping fees and that the loan for $4,000 which he received was not to be offset against such a refund.

178Finally, in re-examination, Mr Katsantoni confirmed that the figure of $21,141.51 income shown in his group certificate was ""too high"".

179The appellant stated that Mr Katsantoni told him he wanted his accounts brought up-to-date. Subsequently he said Mr Katsantoni came to his office. He was shown notes of a meeting which he identified as notes he took at the meeting with Mr Katsantoni. Those notes do not make any reference to Mr Katsantoni being employed by Ladadika. In that part of the notes which the appellant described as detailing Mr Katsantoni's activities, he is described as ""artist fulltime"", whilst it states that his income was around $20,000 it says nothing about deductions.

180The appellant claimed that Mr Katsantoni told him he wanted a loan of $20,000 to update his computers. He said he was involved in the incorporation of T-Rex Art Pty Ltd. He acknowledged that he prepared the replacement group certificate for Mr Katsantoni. He said he would have calculated the top marginal rate due to there being no employment declaration. The appellant stated that Mr Katsantoni did not work for Ladadika in 1997; that was a mistake which arose from the spreadsheet.

181The appellant claimed that Mr Katsantoni signed documents in his presence including loan agreements, tax agent forms and an authority to deposit. He claimed that he gave signed documents relating to tax to Mr Campos and kept a copy. He claimed that there was a loan agreement for $3,000 and that he kept the original. No such document was produced. 

182The appellant said he gave to Mr Katsantoni a copy of the original notice of assessment of tax for the 1997 financial year and then applied the refund toward the repayment of loans and outstanding accounting fees. 

183Finally, so far as the return was concerned, he stated that the $21,141 was the gross figure calculated by using the net wage and top marginal rate. He said that the $9,162 loss for T-Rex Art was arrived at by using books provided by Mr Katsantoni. He said in relation to rent expenses that he apportioned the space in which Mr Katsantoni lived from his working space.

184A number of things can be noted about this evidence. First, it does not appear that the appellant had any material whatsoever to justify the tax instalment deduction contained in the replacement group certificate. Second, the appellant's handwritten note of his discussion with Mr Katsantoni indicated that Mr Katsantoni worked as a graphic artist. That was apparently intended to be reflected in the profit and loss statement. However, even assuming books and records of T-Rex Art were produced by Mr Katsantoni concerning that business, it is apparent from the manner in which the rental calculation was made that this was not based on any actual outgoing. 

185In cross-examination the appellant said that mistakes such as that made as to the identify of Mr Katsantoni's employer were made because he made notes of employees' names and income on loose pieces of paper which he described as working papers. He said he got details of the employees' names and income from a director of the employer company. He was asked why people were put on the Ladadika spreadsheet as a result of an honest mistake. In that context he gave the following answer:

""Ladadika was the top spread sheet within the Excel working paper and that's how I made the honest mistake. From Ladadika started other companies. There were about 15 or 20 companies that I kept details of the gross wage, the tax and net wage. So from those spread sheets, where I extracted the group certificates, so inputting in the working paper to the spread sheet is where the mistake occurred.""

186In subsequent cross-examination the appellant acknowledged that he knew where each of the taxpayers in respect of whom returns were lodged worked at the time he took instructions. Indeed, he stated he could still remember where they worked and roughly how much they earned when he reviewed the documents. He said that after he received tax returns back from Mr Campos he would call in the client to have them signed but he did not check them. He stated that he did not check whether the taxable income was correct even though he was making loans to some of the clients based on that income.

187In relation to instalment deductions the appellant stated that so far as he knew none of the relevant taxpayers provided employment declarations. He stated that he checked with the correct employer if there were in fact declarations and that once he made these inquiries he believed that tax would have been deducted at the highest rate.

188He stated that he did not attempt to determine if tax had been deducted because he did not have the wage books. He simply assumed that tax instalments were deducted. He said that because most companies were in administration, he did not know what payments had been made to the ATO. Subsequently he stated that he did ask the employers if tax had been deducted, acknowledging that he never gave that evidence in chief.

189The appellant denied that the Ladadika spreadsheet was a fabrication to disguise fraud. He denied that he intentionally failed to put the correct employer details on Mr Katsantoni's replacement group certificate.

190In cross-examination which specifically related to the return filed on behalf of Mr Katsantoni, the appellant repeated his evidence that Mr Katsantoni was incorrectly shown as working for Ladadika. The appellant said he was the accountant for T-Rex Art Pty Ltd and incorporated that company on 5 June 1997. He said that the wages claimed were given to Mr Katsantoni in a lump sum by Mr Sweeney. He said he did not attempt to determine if tax was deducted and did not make any inquiries in relation to this matter. 

191He elaborated on his calculation of rent in cross-examination. He stated that that was calculated by apportioning the rent payable by Mr Katsantoni for his residence. He stated he did not make up the figure of $7,508 for rent. He claimed he made a note saying that he was told Mr Katsantoni was paying $400 per week rent. He was referred to a note he took at a conference with Mr Katsantoni which stated that Mr Katsantoni was paying $240 per week rent. He stated this was for his home but he was not sure if it was for the relevant home or the home Mr Katsantoni lived in prior to his first interview with Mr Katsantoni. He denied that he made up the figure of $4,058 shown in the profit and loss statement as being paid to contractors by Mr Katsantoni. He stated Mr Katsantoni was mistaken when he said he had no contractors.

192In re-examination the appellant said that he did not make inquiries if tax had been deducted by T-Rex Art Pty Ltd for wages allegedly paid to Mr Katsantoni because it was not his responsibility. He stated that he had a clearer recollection than Mr Katsantoni about Mr Katsantoni's business in 1997 because he relied on the books and records.

193Mr Sweeney gave evidence that the figures shown for income for Mr Katsantoni of $21,141 with tax instalment deductions of $9,936 did not reflect the arrangements which he had with Mr Katsantoni. He said it was possible that he would have paid Mr Katsantoni around $21,000 over the course of that year but he did not deduct any tax from the amount he paid.

194In relation to the business expenses of T-Rex Art Pty Ltd, Mr Sweeney denied that he charged Mr Katsantoni rent or that the figures for repairs and maintenance shown on the expense sheet reflected any arrangement between Mr Katsantoni or his company, Reel Corporation Pty Ltd (Reel Corporation). It was not put to him in cross-examination that any of this evidence was incorrect.

(c) Consideration

195Several matters emerge clearly from the evidence and were not contested at the trial. The first was that Ladadika was not the employer of Mr Katsantoni during the 1997 tax year. Second, the tax return was incorrect insofar as it stated that instalment deductions of $9,936.15 had been deducted. Mr Katsantoni denied that any such deductions were made, whilst Mr Sweeney denied he contributed any funds to T-Rex Art Pty Ltd which were used as wages from which tax instalments were deducted. The appellant's ultimate position was that he made no inquiries as to whether or not tax instalments were deducted.

196I am also satisfied beyond reasonable date that the loss claimed in respect of the business T-Rex Art Pty Ltd was false for at least two reasons. 

197Although Mr Katsantoni conceded that he may have earned $12,000 income from his business during that year, he denied that he made any rental payments or incurred expenses for repairs and maintenance during the year in question. Mr Sweeney said he did not charge Mr Katsantoni any rental and that the figures for repairs and maintenance did not reflect any arrangement between him and Mr Katsantoni. 

198So far as the rental was concerned, the appellant said it was apportioned having regard to the fact that Mr Katsantoni worked at home. Even if this was correct, the rental payable by Mr Katsantoni according to a note taken by the appellant was $240 per week, meaning that 60% of such rental was apportioned to business expenses, a claim denied by Mr Katsantoni and inherently implausible. In this context it must also be remembered that the tax return prepared from information supplied by Mr Katsantoni showed the business address for T-Rex Art Pty Ltd as the Balmain premises of Mr Sweeney.

199There is no doubt in my mind that the appellant was responsible for the lodgement of the tax return which contained the false information and produced the refund. Although he was not physically responsible for its lodgement, there is no issue that he was responsible for the preparation of the figures which led to its preparation and gave instructions which led to its ultimate lodgement by Mr Filocamo. The appellant did not contend to the contrary. 

200Further, I am satisfied that the appellant knew the information contained in the return was false. So far as the instalment deductions were concerned, it is inherently improbable that tax instalments in respect of a relatively low income earner such as Mr Katsantoni would be deducted at the top marginal rate. The only explanation the appellant proffered was that he did not believe that Mr Katsantoni signed an employment declaration. He acknowledged that he did not inquire whether tax was deducted, much less at what rate.

201It must also be remembered that T-Rex Art Pty Ltd was only incorporated in June 1997. The appellant's statement that the wages were paid to Mr Katsantoni in a lump sum by Mr Sweeney was denied by both Mr Katsantoni and Mr Sweeney. There was no evidence to support that statement and it was not suggested to Mr Sweeney that his evidence was incorrect. Neither was it suggested to Mr Sweeney that his statement that he did not charge Mr Katsantoni rent or monies for repairs and maintenance was incorrect.

202It is totally implausible that an accountant such as the appellant would have caused a tax return to be lodged in those circumstances without knowing it to be false. It must be remembered that the appellant acknowledged he was familiar with group certificates and tax returns and was aware of the importance of honesty and accuracy in dealing with clients' affairs. Further, it must be remembered in this regard that Ramace, a company controlled by the appellant, received the benefit of the refund. It is not necessary to determine whether the money was received in repayment of a loan or fees due by Mr Katsantoni. Whatever be the case, the appellant or his company profited from a tax return which was manifestly false.

203It follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the return was false to the knowledge of the appellant and that it was lodged with the intention of dishonestly obtaining money from the Commonwealth for the benefit of the appellant or his company.

204In these circumstances I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the appellant was guilty of the charge the subject of Count 1.

(b) The evidence

208Mr Lagomigis was also known as Yiannis Lagos and gave evidence under the latter name.

209Mr Lagomigis gave evidence that he met the appellant in 1995 or 1996, about a year after he left high school. He said he wanted to open a car audio business.

210He registered the name Colossus Car Audio. His first shop was at Greenacre.

211In early 1998 he went to the appellant's office at Brighton Le Sands taking all his financial documents for 1996, 1997 and 1998. He said he had not lodged any tax returns for those years.

212He said that he told the appellant that he wanted the appellant to do his accounting work. He said there was no discussion about filing tax returns and he was never shown any tax returns. He said he signed documents but denied they included tax returns. He stated he talked to the appellant about borrowing money.

213Mr Lagomigis said that in 1999 the business that he was operating moved to Canterbury where he subleased premises from a Mr Louis Magliveras, paying about $200 per week. He said he did not work for Mr Magliveras and there were no other financial arrangements between them. There was no issue that Mr Louis Magliveras was the same person as Mr Elijah Magliveras to whom I have referred previously.

214He stated that as the business was expanding he wanted to borrow some money. He said that the appellant assisted him in borrowing $3,000 from St George Bank and that he signed the documents at St George Bank in the appellant's presence. 

215Mr Lagomigis stated that a few days after he signed the document he received $3,000 in cash from the appellant. He was told he would receive an additional $2,000 in two or three weeks which he did not receive. He said that there were no arrangements for him to repay the $3,000 loan.

216Mr Lagomigis stated that he did not discuss interest on the loan with the appellant. He stated that they discussed fees payable for accountancy work but not for income tax returns. He said that the appellant asked him to sign documents from time to time but he did not read them and they were not explained to him by the appellant.

217Mr Lagomigis said that he went bankrupt in February 2000 having been advised to do so by the appellant. He stated that from 1997 to 1999 Colossus Car Audio was ""holding its own""; the loss that it incurred was never more than about $2,000.

218Mr Lagomigis stated he did not believe that he had ever set up a company. He stated that from 1997 to 1999 he was working for himself under the business name Colossus Car Audio and was never employed by anyone else. He stated he never worked for Ladadika although he twice went to the nightclub as a customer.

219He said that Colossus Car Audio paid rent but did not have any motor vehicle expenses.

220In relation to Count 2, Mr Lagomigis said that he had never heard of the Canley Vale PO Box shown on the tax return. He had never heard of Mr Filocamo, Mr Campos, or Messrs Gonzalez and Lopez. He claimed the appellant did not tell him someone else would be preparing his tax return.

221He said that the 1997 tax return was incorrect. He was not employed by Ladadika and neither the income nor the tax instalments were correct. He stated that the appellant had advised him that his business was below the tax free threshold so he was not paying tax. His belief was that tax instalments were not being deducted.

222So far as the business was concerned, Mr Lagomigis said the business details were correct. However, the income of $12,425 was false as were the expenses of $25,563. They should have both been around $15,000. He said the loss of $13,118 was incorrect; it should have been around $2,000.

223Mr Lagomigis said he did not receive a notice of assessment nor was he advised that a refund cheque of $10,522 had been received. He identified handwriting on the back of the cheque as that of the appellant and said that he did not authorise anyone to bank it into an account of Ramace.

224In relation to the 1998 tax return, he repeated his lack of knowledge of the Canley Vale PO Box or of the involvement of Mr Filocamo. He denied he was employed by Ladadika and stated that the income shown on the return of $24,641 was incorrect as were the deductions of $11,581.

225So far as Colossus Car Audio was concerned, he stated that business income was not $10,481 but would have been closer to $4,000. He denied the expenses of $25,853 and said they should have been closer to $1,500. He said the business made a loss of much less than $15,500. 

226He was not told by the appellant that he was entitled to a refund of $10,994 and he did not authorise it to be banked into a Ramace account.

227Mr Lagomigis was shown a document headed ""Ladadika Pty Ltd wages breakdown from 2/7/97 for the period 1st July 1997 to 20 March 1998"". He said that it was untrue that he received monthly wages of $4,232 per month for a six month period commencing from 1 July 1997. 

228In relation to the 1999 tax return, he repeated his evidence that he did not recognise the Canley Vale PO Box. He denied that he was employed by Master Auto Trim, stating that he was never employed by or earned income from Mr Magliveras or his business. He said that both the income of $22,140 and tax deductions of $10,405 were incorrect. He stated that he had no other source of income apart from his business.

229So far as income from Colossus Car Audio was concerned, he denied that his 1999 business income was $46,052. He stated the business did not make a loss as large as $16,716 and the expenses listed were incorrect.

230Mr Lagomigis was shown a document with ATO letterhead and a refund cheque of $10,405. He said he was not told of the refund.

231In cross-examination Mr Lagomigis said the last time he saw the books for Colossus Car Audio was when he handed them to the appellant in 1999 or 2000. He acknowledged that he was relying on his memory recalling the gross income from his business.

232It was suggested to him that he borrowed $10,000 from the appellant in 1998, which he denied. He stated that he vaguely recalled going to the appellant's office in 1998 to discuss preparation of his tax returns. He recalled that the appellant gave him advice that he was below the tax free threshold and did not have to pay tax. On that basis he did not think he had to file a return.

233He reiterated that he worked for neither Ladadika nor Master Auto Trim. 

234Mr Magliveras said that in 1997 to 1999 he was running his own business, Master Auto Trim. He stated he knew Mr Lagomigis who used to rent a section of his workshop to do car audio work. He stated that Mr Lagomigis was never employed by Master Auto Trim, although he used to help out with some auto trimming jobs from time to time for which he was paid.

235The appellant gave evidence that in 1998 Mr Lagomigis asked him to prepare accounts for Colossus Car Audio and gave him books to do so. He said he set up Mr Lagomigis' account on an Excel spreadsheet and did his income and expenditure statements for three years from 1997 to 1999.

236He said that he invoiced Mr Lagomigis for his fees but the invoices were missing from his MYOB programme when he got his computer back. He said that in 1998 Mr Lagomigis borrowed $10,000 from him for his business expenses for which he signed a loan agreement.

237The appellant claimed that Mr Lagomigis wanted to get his tax returns done and that he told Mr Lagomigis about the involvement of Mr Campos. He stated that Mr Lagomigis signed documents relating to the appointment of a tax agent and an electronic lodgement declaration. He said that it was incorrect to say that Mr Lagomigis worked for Ladadika in 1997. In fact Mr Lagomigis worked for Master Auto Trim. 

238The appellant claimed that Mr Magliveras told him that Mr Lagomigis worked for Master Auto Trim, in the sense that when he was not busy he would assist Mr Magliveras. He said he did not believe that there was any employment declaration and that Mr Lagomigis earned about $150 to $200 cash per week. I have set out the evidence of Mr Magliveras on this issue above. Further, it should be noted that on the appellant's own evidence the income from Master Auto Trim would not have amounted to more than some $10,000 rather than $24,641 claimed. Also there was no suggestion in the evidence in chief that any tax instalments were deducted.

239In cross-examination the appellant admitted that he was aware that Master Auto Trim was only incorporated on 7 July 1999 but claimed that prior to that time Mr Lagomigis worked for Mr Magliveras trading under that name. It should be noted that part of the material seized from the appellant's office included a profit and loss statement for Mr Magliveras trading as Master Auto Trim for the year ended 30 June 1997. In each of those statements the only expense for casual wages was an amount of $18,098.

240Further, the appellant acknowledged that he did not check with Mr Lagomigis whether the figure in the tax return was correct.

241The appellant was cross-examined on the amount of rent claimed as an expense in the 1997 profit and loss statement for Colossus Car Audio. He said it was rent paid to Mr Magliveras for use of part of the premises at Canterbury. It was pointed out to the appellant that Mr Lagomigis stated he did not move to those premises until 1999 and he responded, ""He had moved in as far as I knew from the records"". The tax return lodged on behalf of Mr Magliveras for the year in question did not declare any rental received. That tax return, which is the subject of Count 27, was prepared from information provided by the appellant.

242In relation to the 1998 return, the appellant acknowledged that it was incorrect to say that Mr Lagomigis worked for Ladadika. He said that Mr Lagomigis worked for Master Auto Trim being paid roughly $250 per week. The appellant said he was told this by Mr Magliveras who also told him that Mr Lagomigis worked for Master Auto Trim in 1999. It should be noted again that on the appellant's own evidence the maximum amount which would have been earned by Mr Lagomigis from Master Auto Trim was $12,500, not the $24,000 referred to in the tax return.

243The appellant was shown a wages breakdown for Ladadika for the period 1 July 1997 to 20 March 1998. He stated that Mr Lagomigis was included on that spreadsheet by mistake. He repeated his evidence that the income figures were given to him by Mr Magliveras. He said he did not check them with Mr Lagomigis because he was dealing with his employer.

244He was referred in cross-examination to the fact that the income earned and deductions said to have been made were identical for the 1997 and 1998 tax years. He agreed in that context that his evidence was that Mr Lagomigis worked irregular hours at Master Auto Trim. He maintained that Mr Magliveras had provided him with the figures. He said he did not check the figures with Mr Lagomigis.

245In relation to business expenses, the appellant said he relied on what Mr Lagomigis told him. He said he went to see Mr Lagomigis at Canterbury where he was subleasing premises from Master Auto Trim. It was put to him that Mr Lagomigis did not move into those premises until 1999 and he disagreed. He denied he made up the claim for rental payments.

246In relation to the 1999 return, the appellant said he did not review previous returns for the purpose of the preparation of material for this return. He said he kept copies of the 1997 and 1998 returns but they were missing. He disagreed with the proposition that $22,140 was a large amount to pay someone who was helping out from time to time, stating it would depend on how much he worked and what Mr Magliveras had agreed to pay him. He said he asked Mr Magliveras how much he was paying Mr Lagomigis.

247The appellant was cross-examined as to the income and expense statement which formed the basis for the claimed business loss in the 1999 year. He said at the time he had the returns prepared he knew that Mr Lagomigis was in financial difficulty but did not know if Mr Lagomigis had declared himself bankrupt. He was asked about the rental claim of $12,085, which he said he got from the books and records kept by Mr Lagomigis. He said he did not know who actually paid it. 

248The appellant agreed he knew Mr Lagomigis was paying Mr Magliveras about $200 per week rent. It was put to him that he knew Mr Lagomigis had moved out of the factory at the beginning of 1999. He said he relied on the books and records and did not ask Mr Lagomigis if the rent was in fact $200 a week. He acknowledged he prepared the statement after 30 June 1999 but stated that he was not aware when Mr Lagomigis moved out of the factory. He agreed $200 a week for six or seven months does not get anywhere near $12,000 but denied the figure was false. He said they came from Mr Lagomigis' books and records and advice from him.

249The appellant was asked where Mr Lagomigis' books and records were, to which he said they would have been given back to Mr Lagomigis or they could have been kept in his office. He could not recall which.

250It was suggested to the appellant in cross-examination, which he denied, that the reason Mr Lagomigis was recorded as working for Ladadika in 1997 and 1998 but for Master Auto Trim in 1999 was that Ladadika had gone into liquidation and could no longer be used as a vehicle for fraud. It was pointed out to him that the replacement group certificate in relation to Count 45 was found at the office of Mr Campos. He acknowledged that the certificate had his handwriting on it but denied that he attempted to forge Mr Magliveras' signature, stating that it would have been the signature of Mr Magliveras. He acknowledged that Mr Magliveras denied signing the group certificate but claimed he had signed it in front of him.

251The appellant was then cross-examined about an electronic lodgement declaration found in Mr Campos' office for Mr Lagomigis which contained the appellant's handwriting. He denied that Mr Lagomigis' signature was forged on that document.

252Evidence was given by Ms Cindy English to whom I will refer in more detail later. She stated that she assisted Mr Magliveras with his books, including the wages book. She stated she knew of Mr Lagomigis and that he was not an employee of Master Auto Trim.

(c) Consideration

(i) Count 2

253It was common ground that Mr Lagomigis did not work for Ladadika. If the evidence of Mr Lagomigis was accepted, then his income tax return was incorrect as to the amount he earned from employment, the tax instalment deductions said to have been made and the business loss claimed. The appellant by contrast asserted that the figures were correct.

254The appellant's evidence, in my opinion, cannot be accepted. Mr Lagomigis denied that he worked for Master Auto Trim. This was generally confirmed by Mr Magliveras, although as set out at par [234] above, Mr Magliveras said that Mr Lagomigis used to help out with some auto trimming jobs from time to time for which he was paid. Further, on the appellant's own evidence, the most that Mr Lagomigis was earning was about $200 per week which is a little over $10,000 per year compared to the amount of $24,641 claimed in the return. It defies belief that tax deductions in excess of the amount of wages the appellant believed Mr Lagomigis was receiving were made. The appellant gave no evidence as to whether he made any inquiries that such instalments were deducted.

255Further, there is no support for the assertion that Mr Lagomigis was paid $24,641 by Mr Magliveras in the year in question. The profit and loss statement for Mr Magliveras trading as Master Auto Trim in the 1997 tax year only refers to expenses for casual staff of $18,098.

256So far as the business expenses were concerned, there is no support for at least the claim for rental expenses. Such a claim was inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Lagomigis and with the tax return for Mr Magliveras lodged from information prepared by the appellant. 

257I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant caused to be filed the return knowing the information was false. There was no material in his possession which lent support to the information in the return to which I have referred above. The amount said to have been earned as wages was contrary to what was contained in the profit and loss statement prepared for Mr Magliveras as was the statement of rental income. Further, the amount of earnings was contrary to what the appellant stated that he believed Mr Lagomigis had earned and the appellant had no evidence to support the claim for tax instalment deductions which was self-evidently absurd.

258I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the purpose of lodging the return was to claim the tax refund for the benefit of Ramace. Once again, it is immaterial whether or not Mr Lagomigis owed money to the appellant. Whatever be the position between them, the fact remains that Ramace took the benefit of the payment.

259It follows in my opinion that Count 2 was made out.

(ii) Count 9

260Once again it was common ground that contrary to what was stated in the return the subject of this count, Mr Lagomigis did not work for Ladadika.

261One of the remarkable features of this return is that although the appellant acknowledged that Mr Lagomigis worked irregular hours for Mr Magliveras, the income stated to have been earned and the tax instalments deducted were identical to what was claimed to have been earned and deducted in the previous year. The appellant's only justification was Mr Magliveras told him the figures. This was inconsistent with his statement of what he believed Mr Lagomigis was earning in the 1997 year, being $150-$200 per week, the profit and loss statement prepared for Mr Magliveras for that year and the appellant's evidence that in the 1998 and 1999 years he believed Mr Lagomigis was being paid $250 per week, $13,000 per year. 

262The appellant acknowledged that he did not ask his client if the income was correct or if the tax deductions had in fact been made.

263Further, it is self-evident that if the income earned by Mr Lagomigis was $13,000, there were no conceivable reasons for deductions of over $11,000 having been made.

264Further, I am satisfied that the appellant knew that these figures were false. They were contrary to his belief of the income earned, he had no basis for asserting that the tax instalment deductions were made and it was self-evident that it was remarkable that identical figures would be produced for the 1997 and 1998 years for casual work performed on an irregular basis. It is even more remarkable when it is taken into account that in the two years in question the appellant's evidence was that he believed Mr Lagomigis was earning different amounts.

265It follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence the subject of Count 9 was made out.

(iii) Count 45

266This count can be dealt with shortly. As with Count 9 which related to the previous year, the amount stated as wages earned by Mr Lagomigis was contrary to the appellant's stated belief that Mr Lagomigis was earning $250 per week. In these circumstances a deduction of $10,405.80 is inherently improbable. The appellant provided no basis for the claim that the instalment deductions were made and there was nothing in his records to justify the replacement group certificate which he prepared. In these circumstances I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the return was lodged containing information known to the appellant to be false and that the purpose of the appellant doing so was to obtain the benefit of the refund for his company Ramace.

267It follows that Count 45 is made out.

Count 6 - Mr Peter Tsigolis - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 1998

(a) The summary

268The summary sheet for Mr Tsigolis shows that his tax return for the year ended 30 June 1998 was lodged on 2 October 1998. The contact details were the Canley Vale PO Box.

269The return showed income of $17,258 earned from Ladadika with tax instalments of $8,111.26 being deducted. It also showed income of $5,275 with deductions of $441.03 from a company, Wejo Pty Ltd (Wejo).

270The summary shows that a tax refund of $4,720.33 was received which was banked into the account of Ramace.

271The summary also discloses that the appellant had in his possession the statement of earnings for Mr Tsigolis signed by Mr McDonald showing the amounts referred to in the return. The appellant also had the following additional documents which were relevant:

(a) A group certificate issued by Wejo.

(b) A tax file number advice dated 29 January 1998 to Mr Tsigolis at an address in Rockdale.

(c) An authority to deposit the 1998 refund into the Ramace account.

(d) A 1998 tax return showing income only earned from Wejo.

(e) A tax calculation for a 1998 refund of $2,022.97, crossed out and inserted in handwriting ""Refund $4,720.33"".

(f) An electronic lodgement declaration for 1998 taxable income showing income of $22,248 and total tax of $8,552.29 the contact being Mr Lopez.

272The summary also shows that Mr Campos had in his possession a copy of Mr Tsigolis' statement of earnings for 1998 signed by Mr McDonald.

273It should be noted there was no issue that Mr Tsigolis worked for Wejo, a company which controlled various McDonald's franchise restaurants, and was paid the amount stated in the return by that company which made the tax instalment deductions claimed. The alleged fraud in this case related to the refund generated by the inclusion of the Ladadika income and tax instalment deductions.

(b) The evidence

274Mr Tsigolis gave evidence that in 1998 he was 19 years of age, working at McDonald's at Bexley. He saw the appellant after his first full year of being employed by McDonald's. He had no other salary. He asked the appellant to do his tax return.

275Mr Tsigolis said that during the tax year ended 30 June 1998 he did not work anywhere other than McDonald's and he did not tell the appellant that he worked anywhere else. He stated that he was paid approximately $150 per week depending on the hours he worked. Mr Tsigolis stated he never told the appellant he earned an income from Ladadika. He was shown the tax return and stated he knew nothing of the Canley Vale PO Box, or that Mr Filocamo, Mr Campos or Messrs Lopez and Gonzalez were involved in the preparation and lodgement of his tax return.

276Mr Tsigolis said he commenced working for Tsigolis Rendering after 30 June 1998. He stated he never worked for Ladadika, nor did he borrow money from any company associated with the appellant including Ramace. 

277He said he was not told by the appellant that the appellant had received a refund cheque of $4,720. He did not authorise the appellant to keep the money. He was shown an authority to deposit the refund into Ramace in repayment of a loan and he denied the document contained his signature.

278He was shown an electronic lodgement declaration disclosing an income of $22,533. Mr Tsigolis stated that the figures were incorrect and he was never asked to sign the document by the appellant. 

279In cross-examination it was put to Mr Tsigolis that he went to see the appellant because he wanted a loan for a car. He denied telling the appellant that he had been working with his father for two years prior to 1997. It was put to Mr Tsigolis that he worked for Tsigolis Rendering from 15 July 1997 to 21 January 1998. Mr Tsigolis denied this and he said he did not earn $17,258 between 15 July 1997 and 21 January 1998 from Tsigolis Rendering. Mr Tsigolis reiterated in cross-examination that he did not authorise the tax refund cheque to be deposited in the Ramace account to offset loan repayments or fees for preparation of the tax return.

280In his evidence in chief the appellant stated he met Mr Tsigolis in 1998 or 1999. He said that Mr Tsigolis asked him for a loan for $4,000 or $5,000 to buy a new car. He stated at the time Mr Tsigolis was either 16 or 17.

281The appellant claimed he lent Mr Tsigolis the money and there was a loan agreement. He stated the tax return was incorrect insofar as it showed that Mr Tsigolis worked for Ladadika rather than Tsigolis Rendering. He stated that the figure of $17,258 gross income was arrived at by calculating from the net wage paid to Mr Tsigolis. The appellant stated that the mistake happened in the transfer of information to the Excel spreadsheet. He said that instead of putting Mr Tsigolis under Tsigolis Rendering in the spreadsheet, he put him under Ladadika. He said tax was at the top rate because there was no employment declaration.

282The appellant said he was repaid the money loaned to Mr Tsigolis. He received a notice of assessment and told Mr Tsigolis that he was entitled to a refund. He said that occurred in 1998 in his office. He said that there would have been some surplus which he gave to Mr Tsigolis in cash.

283However, in cross-examination the appellant was taken to the Excel spreadsheet showing what purported to be wage records for Ladadika for the 1997/1998 tax year. It was pointed out to him that Mr Tsigolis' name did not appear on that spreadsheet. He said it could not have been the final document, as sometimes he continued to work on a document or saved the file as a new document under a different name.

284Notwithstanding, the appellant continued to contend that he prepared the 1998 Ladadika group certificate by mistake. He said that Mr Tsigolis worked for his father at Tsigolis Rendering. He agreed that on Mr Tsigolis' file there was no reference to him working for Tsigolis Rendering. He said he would have had a separate loan file but he did not know where it was.

285It was put to him that there was no such loan for a car, which he denied.

286The appellant agreed that there was what was described as a ""catalogue of mistakes"" regarding Mr Tsigolis working at Ladadika. The name of employee and the occupation were mistakes. He stated that the tax instalments were calculated on the basis of no employment declaration.

287The appellant was cross-examined on the fact that he had in his possession another tax return for Mr Tsigolis showing only Wejo as his employer and the income and deductions relating to Mr Tsigolis' employment with that company. He stated that he must have had that in his possession because he was testing new software. He denied keeping two sets of accounts for purposes of fraud. He acknowledged that the loan agreement in relation to the alleged loan to Mr Tsigolis was missing. 

288It should be noted that Mr Tsigolis' father, Mr Nick Tsigolis, gave evidence that his son started working for Tsigolis Rendering Pty Ltd (Tsigolis Rendering) in approximately 1999 for about six months. He stated that Mr Tsigolis as a young boy worked at McDonald's before he worked for Tsigolis Rendering and after ceasing to work for that company he continued to work for McDonald's.

289In cross-examination Mr Nick Tsigolis denied on a number of occasions that his son worked for Tsigolis Rendering in the 1998 tax year, although he ultimately stated he could not recall whether or not his son worked for Tsigolis Rendering between July 1997 and January 2008.

(c) Consideration

290Once again it was common ground that the return was incorrect insofar as it asserted that Mr Tsigolis was employed by Ladadika.

291In dealing with the previous counts I did not find it necessary to conclude whether the insertion of Ladadika as the employer was part of the fraud which was perpetrated by the appellant. In those cases the name of the taxpayer was found on the Excel spreadsheet that the appellant claimed was the source of his mistakes.

292The present case is different. The name of Mr Tsigolis did not appear on the spreadsheet. The only explanation the appellant offered was there was a later version of the spreadsheet. However, none was produced nor was one found in the material obtained from the appellant's computer.

293Further, the appellant acknowledged that he was aware that Mr Tsigolis at the time of the return was too young to be employed as a barman as was stated on the tax return.

294In these circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew at the time of the lodgement of the return that the identity of Ladadika as the employer was false.

295Further, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the figures contained in the income tax return for wages and instalment deductions were false. Mr Tsigolis' evidence was that he did not work for Tsigolis Rendering in the 1998 year. That evidence was supported by his father, albeit Mr Nick Tsigolis qualified his evidence to a limited extent at the end of his cross-examination. Further, there was no material in the appellant's possession which would support the contention that the amount said to have been earned was earned from Tsigolis Rendering or any other source.

296In this regard it is significant that the appellant had in his possession a tax return showing Wejo as the sole employer. The return was consistent with the evidence of Mr Tsigolis as to his earnings for the financial year. The explanation given by the appellant that it was brought into existence as the appellant was testing new software was implausible.

297Critically there was no evidence to support the deductions claimed. On his own evidence the appellant made no inquiries as to whether the instalment deductions were made. It is inherently improbable that deductions of this amount would be made from the salary of a person earning the amount Mr Tsigolis was claimed to have earned.

298In these circumstances I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the return was false to the knowledge of the appellant, both as to the amount of income said to have been earned from Ladadika and the instalments deducted.

299I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the purpose of the provision by the appellant of the information was to enable a false return to be lodged to benefit Ramace. The refund cheque was banked into the Ramace account and Mr Tsigolis said he was not told of the refund. The appellant said there might have been a surplus (presumably after deduction of fees, as on the appellant's evidence the loan which he asserted he made to Mr Tsigolis had been repaid) which was paid to Mr Tsigolis. There was no record of any such payment or invoice for any such fees. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence should not be accepted.

300In these circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence the subject of Count 6 was made out.

Count 7 - Mr Walter Butler - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 1997
Count 8 - Mr Walter Butler - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 1998

(a) The summary

301The summary for the year ended 30 June 1997 shows that the tax return lodged on Mr Butler's behalf claimed he received income of $37,441 from Ladadika, from which $17,597.27 was deducted by way of tax instalments. It also shows that the return stated Mr Butler incurred a loss of $24,666 from a business, Walter Mark Butler, Marketing Consultancy.

302The summary shows that as a result Mr Butler became entitled to a refund of $16,272.27 and received a cheque in the sum of $24,805.19 in respect of that year and the subsequent year which was banked into the account of Ramace.

303The summary records that the following documents were found in the appellant's possession:

(a) A statement of earning for 1997 for Mr Butler signed by Mr McDonald showing wages of $37,441 received from Ladadika and tax instalment deductions of $17,597.27.

(b) A replacement group certificate recording these amounts.

(c) A profit and loss statement for 1997 for Mr Butler showing a net loss of $24,666.

(c) An electronic lodgement declaration for 1997 showing taxable income of $12,775 and total tax of $17,597.27.

304Documents obtained from Mr Campos indicated that he held a similar statement of earnings.

305The summary for the year ended 30 June 1998 shows that Mr Butler's tax return stated that he received $68,887 income from Ladadika from which tax instalments of $31,436.89 were deducted. It shows he was entitled to a tax refund of $8,532.92 and, as I indicated above, a cheque in the sum of $24,805.19 was received comprising a refund for both the 1997 and 1998 tax years. The monies were banked into the Ramace account.

306The summary records that the following hardcopy documents were in the appellant's possession:

(a) A statement of earnings for 1998 and a replacement group certificate consistent with what appears in the return.

(b) Electronic lodgement declarations also consistent with the returns.

(c) Tax calculations calculating a refund of $8,532.92.

(d) A notice of amended assessment posted to Mr Butler at the Canley Vale PO Box address dated 24 November 1999.

307The amended notice of assessment referred to above recorded that Mr Butler was liable to pay tax in an amount of $666.02 as a result of the Medicare levy not being taken into account.

308The summary also records that Mr Campos held a similar statement of earnings.

(b) The evidence

309Mr Butler in his evidence said that in the early 1990s he worked in home entertainment marketing sales for a number of different employers. He asked the appellant to prepare his tax returns. He knew nothing of the involvement of Mr Campos Mr Filocamo or Messrs Gonzalez or Lopez.

310Mr Butler said that he had never asked the appellant to lend him money. He said that in 1995 or 1996 he asked the appellant to arrange a loan on his behalf which he thought was arranged with St George Bank.

311Mr Butler said that he also saved money with Ramace for the deposit on a house. He did so by depositing money with Ramace, which accumulated interest, for approximately 12 months whenever he had money available. 

312Mr Butler was referred to the 1997 income tax return the subject of Count 7. He stated that he never had heard of the Canley Vale PO Box, and he knew nothing about Mr Filocamo lodging tax returns on his behalf. 

313Mr Butler denied he ever worked for Ladadika and stated that the figure of $37,441 was not what he earned. He said he would have earned more. He stated that it was wrong to say that $17,597.27 was deducted on his behalf from any salary paid to him by Ladadika.

314Mr Butler said that contrary to his tax return, he did not incur a business loss of $24,666. He acknowledged he was conducting a business in that year but did not think that it made a loss.

315Mr Butler said that during the 1997 tax year he worked as a consultant for the Reel Corporation which was run by Mr Sweeney. His income was the retainer he received from Reel Corporation amounting to $50,000.

316Mr Butler was referred to the gross income of $22,874 in respect of the consultancy business said to have been carried on by him. He stated it was incorrect and he denied incurring a loss of $24,666. In particular he denied that he paid rent for premises in an amount of $15,473.

317Mr Butler said he knew nothing about a refund of $16,272. He said he was expecting to pay tax that year. Mr Butler said he was never told by the appellant that he was keeping the refund in his bank account, and further, he did not authorise payment of the refund into the Ramace account.

318In relation to the 1998 tax return he again denied that he was employed by Ladadika and said that the statement of his income of $66,887 was incorrect. He said that the source of income from that year was his consultancy business Moljac Marketing Pty Ltd (Moljac Marketing) and its income increased from $50,000 to $70,000. He thought that Moljac Marketing would have been paying tax on income on his behalf.

319He was referred to the fact that the rate of tax deducted was 48.5%. He stated he did not believe any deduction would be at that level. In particular, he denied that he earned $66,887 in eight and a half months.

320In cross-examination Mr Butler agreed that he controlled a company called Binford Holdings Pty Ltd (Binford) and could have been working for it during that year. He acknowledged that Moljac Marketing was a proprietary company. 

321Mr Butler agreed that he introduced the appellant to Mr Sweeney, who he described as the owner of Reel Entertainment Pty Ltd (Reel Entertainment), who also became a client of the appellant. He agreed that he told the appellant that he wished to purchase a property and sought advice from him about the best way of getting a loan for the property.

322Mr Butler agreed that he had a discussion with the appellant about how to restructure his business affairs and that the appellant suggested that he start a company and trade under that company as a marketing consultant. However, Mr Butler said the conversation took place in 1993 or 1994, not in 1997.

323It was suggested to Mr Butler that the appellant told him his services cost about $20,000 per year. The appellant stated he could not recall that conversation but said it sounded a bit high for someone earning $70,000 per year. He agreed, however, that the appellant told him he could invest money with Ramace and earn interest at 15%.

324In cross-examination Mr Butler denied that he asked the appellant to find a tax agent to do his tax returns and that the appellant indicated that Mr Campos could do them for him. He said he gave the appellant information such as bank statements, chequebooks, invoices and receipts so financial statements could be prepared.

325Ultimately, it was put to Mr Butler and he agreed that he may have worked for Binford for the 1997/1998 financial year. However, he rejected the proposition that he earned $37,000 in the 1997 year, saying his gross income was around $70,000. He also denied he earned $66,887 for the eight months from 1 July 1997 to 13 March 1998, as stated on the return.

326Mr Butler also denied in cross-examination that he agreed to have his tax refund cheques deposited into the account of Ramace to offset against bookkeeping fees and/or loans due to Ramace.

327He denied he needed a deposit of $70,000 to purchase property at Leichhardt, stating in re-examination the property he purchased at Leichhardt cost $310,000 and he struggled to get a 10% deposit.

328In his examination in chief the appellant stated that he met Mr Butler in 1993 and that in 1998 he was asked by Mr Butler to prepare books and incorporate companies for him. The appellant said that he held funds on Mr Butler's behalf and obtained housing or investment loans for him.

329He claimed the loans that he organised were for $230,000 or $250,000 for a unit in Marrickville and $650,000 for a residential property in Leichhardt. He took a brokerage fee for the work and it was paid in full.

330So far as the tax returns were concerned the appellant stated that he obtained all of Mr Butler's records from him and that Ladadika was inserted as the employer by mistake. He said that Mr Butler was in fact employed by his private company, Binford. He said the income of $37,441 was correct, stating that the gross income was calculated based on his net wage plus the top marginal tax rate due to there being no employment declaration. The appellant stated that he followed this process for every taxpayer the subject of the proceedings. For convenience when I subsequently refer to the usual manner, I will refer to this process.

331He stated that the insertion of Ladadika was a mistake which arose from the Excel spreadsheet. The appellant referred to the profit and loss statement for Mr Butler for the year ended 30 June 1997 in respect of the marketing consultancy business said to have been carried on by him. The appellant said that in this year Mr Butler was self-employed for part of the year and then was employed by Binford. He claimed that the deduction of consultancy fees for $12,855 was due to him for work separate from his accountancy work. He stated that the tax return was signed by Mr Butler in his presence.

332So far as the 1998 return was concerned, the appellant acknowledged the replacement group certificate for the 1998 year was incorrect. He said the periods of employment would have been derived from records received by Mr Butler and the gross wage was calculated in the usual manner.

333In cross-examination he acknowledged that there was no reference to Mr Butler on the Ladadika spreadsheet. As I indicated in relation to Mr Tsigolis, the appellant's explanation was effectively that the document may have been a work in progress. He stated that he did not check with anyone to see if tax was in fact paid on Mr Butler's income. The appellant acknowledged that the books of Binford showed that no tax had been paid. He made the somewhat extraordinary statement that it was not false or misleading to state that $17,500 tax had been paid when it had not been, apparently on the basis that there was an obligation on the company to pay it and the employee would be entitled to a group certificate. 

334The appellant was asked in respect to the 1997 return that if Mr Butler was employed by Binford, what the source of the business income was. He said it was because for part of the year Mr Butler traded under his own name.

335The appellant continued to assert in cross-examination that he was authorised to retain the tax refund.

(c) Consideration

336These counts can be dealt with shortly. First, it was common ground that Ladadika did not employ Mr Butler. Second, Mr Butler's name did not appear on the Ladadika spreadsheet. There was thus no foundation for the excuse that Ladadika was inserted as the employer as a result of Mr Butler's name being mistakenly placed on the spreadsheet. In those circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware that the statement that Ladadika was the employer of Mr Butler was false to the knowledge of the appellant.

337Third, even accepting the possibility that Mr Butler worked for Binford during the years in question, the appellant expressly acknowledged that the books of Binford did not disclose the deduction of any tax instalments. His explanation that a statement could be made in a tax return that instalments were deducted when they were not, on the basis that the employer may have had a liability to deduct instalments, and as a consequence it was appropriate to add an amount to income received and state that instalments were deducted, is unbelievable. It is particularly unbelievable from an accountant experienced in tax returns.

338I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the information which led to the false returns being lodged was prepared by the appellant for the purpose of generating a refund for the benefit of Ramace. Ramace banked the cheque and retained the proceeds as was clearly intended by the preparation of the authority to deposit. It is immaterial whether or not this was done because the appellant knew or believed that Mr Butler owed Ramace money. The fact remains that Ramace benefited from the refund as intended by the appellant.

339In these circumstances it is unnecessary to deal with the question of whether the loss claimed to have been incurred from the carrying on of the consultancy business in the 1997 year was false to the knowledge of the appellant.

340It follows, in my opinion, that Counts 7 and 8 were proved beyond reasonable doubt.

Count 10 - Mrs Leanne Magoulias - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 1997 
Count 11 - Mrs Leanne Magoulias - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 1998

(a) The summary

341The summary in respect of Count 10 shows that a tax return was lodged for Mrs Magoulias declaring income of $10,144 with tax instalment deductions of $4,767.68. The employer was said to be Ladadika. It shows that a refund of $4,026.88 was received but does not reveal what occurred to it.

342The summary shows there was in the appellant's possession a statement of earnings for 1997 in the same terms as the tax return, a replacement group certificate and an authority to deposit the 1997 refund into Ramace.

343The summary also shows that the appellant also held in his possession various incomplete electronic lodgement declaration forms.

344The summary also discloses that Mr Campos had a statement of earnings similar to that held by the appellant.

345The summary in respect of Count 11 shows that the tax return lodged on behalf of Mrs Magoulias, which was lodged on the same date as that for the 1997 year, 12 October 1998, showed income of $24,463 together with instalment deductions of $11,497.61. The employer stated was Ladadika.

346The summary also shows that the appellant had in his possession statements of earnings and replacement group certificates consistent with what was shown in the return, an authority to deposit the 1998 refund into Ramace, and an electronic lodgement declaration which was incomplete with the name Sotirios Magoulias whited out and Leanne Magoulias written over it. The summary also states that the appellant held a 1998 electronic lodgement declaration consistent with the tax return.

347So far as Mr Campos was concerned, the summary shows that he also held the same statement of earnings as that held by the appellant.

(b) The evidence

348In her evidence in chief Mrs Magoulias said that she remained at home for two years from 1995 looking after her first child. She said that she had her second child in 1998 and during the whole of the period the subject of the charges was not working anywhere.

349She said she was pregnant with her second child when she met the appellant. She said she signed documents periodically with the appellant. He showed here where to sign and she would sign. She was not given time to read the documents.

350She said she did not borrow any money from the appellant.

351Mrs Magoulias stated that she earned no income for the financial year ended 30 June 1997. She never held the position of Staff Development Officer referred to in the tax return, she was not employed by Ladadika, and she did not earn $10,144 from that company or otherwise.

352Mrs Magoulias said she never received any mail with the Canley Vale PO Box address. She knew nothing about a tax refund of $4,026 in the 1997 year, nor did the appellant tell her that he received a cheque of $6,905 being a refund for the 1998 year.

353So far as the 1998 tax return was concerned, she said she was not a Staff Development Officer and did not work for Ladadika. She stated that she did not earn $24,463 in that year, stating she had no income in that year. 

354She knew nothing about the purported tax deduction of $11,497. She would not have signed a tax return with those figures on it.

355Mrs Magoulias stated that she did not authorise any tax refund to be deposited into the listed Ramace account.

356Mrs Magoulias was also shown a tax return that was in the appellant's possession which stated that for 1998 she earned $32,054 from Master Marble & Granite with tax of $6,874.52 deducted. She denied that she earned that income.

357Mrs Magoulias said she had difficulty reading because she had dyslexia. She said that she informed the appellant of her dyslexia when she first went to see him.

358In cross-examination it was suggested to her that the appellant loaned her and her husband approximately $28,000 repayable over three years. She denied this. She also denied that the appellant had told her that he was not a tax agent and that Mr Campos would do the returns.

359She acknowledged that she signed electronic declaration forms for Master Marble & Granite for 1997 and 1998. However, she denied she worked for the business in that year and stated she did not earn $450 net per week.

360She denied she was paid $450 a week in cash in 1997 and that she phoned customers and collected money. She stated that she only paid house bills. She also denied that she was maintaining books and records and chequebooks for the Master Marble & Granite business. She reiterated that she did not draw a wage from that company.

361The appellant's evidence was that he met Mrs Magoulias through her husband. He stated that she was a director of Master Marble & Granite Pty Ltd, a company which he caused to be incorporated in 1997 or 1998.

362He stated that in 1998 Mrs Magoulias asked him to advance funds to her and her husband and to help her find someone to do her tax return.

363He claimed that he arranged a housing loan for a property at Bexley and that he took the fee for organising the loan partly out of the tax refund cheque. The appellant claimed he advanced $15,000 to help Mr and Mrs Magoulias with their business. The appellant said Mrs Magoulias mostly came to meetings with her husband. He said that at the time of signing an authority to deposit the tax refund cheque into the Ramace account Mrs Magoulias owed $15,000 plus fees for the preparation of the tax returns. He said that the $15,000 was paid back through tax refund cheques.

364The appellant stated that the 1997 records showing that Mrs Magoulias worked for Ladadika were incorrect. He said she worked for Master Marble & Granite Pty Ltd running the administration side of the business and earned $300 to $400 per week. Similarly, he stated that it was incorrect that Mrs Magoulias worked for Ladadika in the 1998 tax year. He said that she worked for Master Marble & Granite Pty Ltd in administration earning $400 to $450 per week. He claimed he told her of the tax refund and she signed an authority to deposit.

365In cross-examination the appellant acknowledged that there was no reference in the Ladadika spreadsheet to Mrs Magoulias working for Ladadika in the periods in question. He stated that the spreadsheet may not have been the final document and he pointed to the fact that Mr Steven Liontos and Mr Steven Venieris, two people who he claimed in fact worked for Ladadika, did not appear on the spreadsheet.

366Mr Venieris' returns were the subject of Counts 29 and 44. He denied ever working for Ladadika. Mr Liontos also denied ever working for that company.

367In his cross-examination concerning the incorrect identity of Mrs Magoulias' employer for both the 1997 and 1998 years, the appellant denied that it was a huge coincidence that he had made the same mistake for two consecutive years.

368In his cross-examination the appellant gave conflicting evidence concerning monies due to him from Mrs Magoulias and her husband, Mr Sotirios Magoulias. He stated initially in cross-examination that he was entitled to keep tax refund cheques because there was a joint loan from Ramace to Mr and Mrs Magoulias for about $38,000. He then corrected that to $15,000. He agreed that the 1997 and 1998 refund cheques for Mr and Mrs Magoulias totalled around $38,700. He claimed that he was entitled to keep the surplus over $15,000 because, although the initial loan was for $15,000, he made other payments on their behalf. He said that he believed that he paid the balance over $15,000 to a real estate agent on the instruction of Mr Magoulias. He could not remember what it was for.

369The appellant agreed that money given to Mrs Magoulias for the payment of household expenses had nothing to do with employment income. 

370The appellant was also asked why he had in his possession a tax return for the 1998 year for Mrs Magoulias showing Master Marble & Granite Pty Ltd as the employer. He first said that he tried to do the tax return himself but not in order to lodge it. He again sought to explain the ""mistake"" by reference to the spreadsheet. However, he acknowledged that Mrs Magoulias' name did not appear on that spreadsheet. He denied he printed off the tax return showing Master Marble & Granite to give a false impression to Mr and Mrs Magoulias that he was their tax agent. He denied that he knew that Mrs Magoulias was not employed at all.

371As the evidence relating to the counts in respect of Mr Magoulias' tax return and those relating to Mrs Magoulias somewhat overlap, it is convenient to defer consideration of whether these counts were proved beyond reasonable doubt until after the evidence relating to the counts in respect of the tax returns lodged for Mr Magoulias have been considered.

Count 12 - Mr Sotirios Magoulias - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 1997
Count 13 - Mr Sotirios Magoulias - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 1998

(a) The summary

372The summary shows that the tax return for Mr Magoulias for the 1997 year disclosed income of $22,059 earned from employment with Ladadika with tax deductions of $10,367.73. The return also claimed a $15,655 loss from the business of Master Marble & Granite. 

373The summary shows that Mr Magoulias was assessed as being entitled to a refund for that tax year in the amount of $10,316.93 and that a refund cheque in the sum of $27,818.77 was received, being the total refund to which Mr Magoulias was entitled for both the 1997 and 1998 years. The cheque was banked into the account of Ramace.

374The documents in the possession of the appellant include a statement of earnings signed by Mr McDonald and a replacement group certificate for Mr Magoulias consistent with what was shown on the tax return. Also included were two profit and loss statements for Mr Magoulias trading as Master Marble & Granite. The first showed sales of $43,751, total expenses of $30,377 and a net loss of $14,920, which is somewhat consistent with what was contained in the return. The second, however, showed total expenses of $10,036 with a net profit of $2,837. Profit and loss statements similar to the second were also found on the appellant's computer.

375The records held by Mr Campos disclose that he held a statement of earnings consistent with the statement held by the appellant.

376So far as the 1998 tax year was concerned, according to the summary the return lodged showed income of $38,052 earned from employment with Ladadika with tax instalment deductions of $17,884.44. It also disclosed a $29,699 loss from the business Master Marble & Granite. It disclosed an entitlement to a refund of $17,501.84, which was contained in the cheque for $27,818.77 to which I have referred above.

377The documents held by the appellant include statement of earnings and a replacement group certificate consistent with what appears on the return. They also include three profit and loss statements for Mr Magoulias trading as Master Marble & Granite. The first showed a net loss of $29,847. The second showed a net profit of $54,469 and the third a net profit of $15,527. Profit and loss statements consistent with the latter two found in hardcopy in the appellant's records were also contained on the appellant's computer.

(b) The evidence

378Mr Magoulias gave evidence that he worked as a stonemason. He said that he started to do stonemasonry work for his own business Master Marble & Granite in around 1997. He stated that the appellant suggested he incorporate a company, Master Marble & Granite Pty Ltd, in 1998.

379Mr Magoulias said he was the only person who worked in the business before the incorporation of the company. He stated that Mrs Magoulias did not earn income from the business or from the company after its incorporation. 

380Mr Magoulias said his original arrangements with the appellant were that the appellant would look after his paperwork and do his tax returns. He stated the appellant supplied him with a computer and was to come to his work on a monthly basis to put his paperwork together on the computer.

381Mr Magoulias said he initially paid $300 to $400 a month for these services but that he ultimately had trouble in getting the appellant to attend his offices. Subsequently, an arrangement was reached whereby the appellant would do all the paperwork and finalise his tax returns for a fee.

382Mr Magoulias said that the appellant had never mentioned the names of Mr Campos, Mr Filocamo or Messrs Lopez and Gonzalez.

383Mr Magoulias said the appellant asked him to sign documents. However, he did not give him the documents to read before he signed them. Mr Magoulias said the documents were not explained to him by the appellant. 

384In relation to the 1997 return, Mr Magoulias denied that he ever worked as a security guard for Ladadika. He said that he had previously worked as a security guard for Wormalds Security. He stated that he never received any income from Ladadika. 

385Mr Magoulias said he did not earn $22,059 income from any source during the 1997 year. He stated that he would have earned less than $22,000 from Master Marble & Granite. He stated he did not pay tax of $10,367 for that year and would not have signed a return containing that information.

386In relation to that part of the return showing a loss of $15,655 for Master Marble & Granite, Mr Magoulias said he could not say whether the total business income derived from that business for the 1997 year was $43,751. He stated he did not recall total expenses of $59,406 and he could not say the loss claimed was correct.

387Mr Magoulias denied that the appellant ever told him that he was entitled to a refund of tax or that the appellant had received a refund cheque for $27,818.77.

388It was pointed out to Mr Magoulias that the replacement group certificate stated his period of employment with Ladadika was from 1 April 1997 to 30 June 1997. He denied working for that company during that period or that he earned $22,059 from any source over a three-month period. It must be remembered that Ladadika was only incorporated on 17 June 1997.

389Mr Magoulias was shown the profit and loss statement which formed the basis of the business loss claimed in the tax return. He stated the rent expenses of $3,169 shown on that document were incorrect. He said the correct amount for such expenses was about $2,000. He denied he spent $8,648 on subcontractors. Further, it should be noted that the profit and loss statement does not record any wages paid to Mrs Magoulias.

390Mr Magoulias was referred to a further return prepared for him for the 1997 year which showed a business profit of $46,574, comprising income of $236,085 less expenses of $189,511. He said he knew nothing about it.

391In relation to the 1998 return, Mr Magoulias repeated that he did not know the Canley Vale PO Box, or a person known as Vince. He stated he was not a security guard in that year. He said he was not employed by Ladadika, nor did he earn $38,052 for the year. He stated his only income was through his business and it would not have been more than $38,000.

392Mr Magoulias said he had no recollection of any deductions in an amount of $17,884. He understood he would have to pay tax and paid the appellant between $3,000 and $7,000 so he could pay the ATO. 

393Mr Magoulias stated he knew nothing about the $29,699 loss from Master Marble & Granite shown in the tax return. He was shown the profit and loss account shown in the return form and stated he did not recall business income for the year as $133,769 and that the total expenses of $163,468 did not seem right. He did not remember incurring a loss of $29,699.

394Mr Magoulias was shown the other profit and loss statements retrieved from the appellant's office showing profits of $54,469 and $15,527 respectively being derived from the business of Master Marble & Granite for the year ended 30 June 1998. He stated that he was not aware of those documents and did not know why the appellant had them.

395Mr Magoulias stated that the appellant did not tell him he was going to pay a refund cheque into the Ramace bank account.

396In relation to the income tax returns for Mrs Magoulias, Mr Magoulias said that Ladadika did not employ her in the 1997 tax year nor did she earn $10,144. He stated that his business did not pay her that amount of money nor did it pay tax on her behalf of $4,767. He gave similar evidence in relation to her return for 1998, stating that the income of around $24,400 was incorrect as were the tax deductions of $11,400. 

397In cross-examination it was put to Mr Magoulias that he told tax investigators that the signature on the 1998 electronic lodgement declaration was his. He acknowledged that he did so but stated that looking at it again it could be seen that the signature was different.

398Mr Magoulias denied in cross-examination that he was advanced $28,000 for business and personal expenses or that he asked the appellant to find him a tax agent. He stated that as far as he was concerned the tax returns were not supposed to be prepared by Mr Campos. 

399Mr Magoulias also stated that he believed he made less than $974 a week from Master Marble & Granite in the 1997 year. He stated that he did not receive a group certificate or any payslips from Master Marble & Granite during the 1997 year.

400In relation to the 1998 financial year, Mr Magoulias ultimately stated that he employed staff that year. He said his wife was only working as an administrator for a little while when he first opened up but that she did general office work as well as answering phones for a couple of days a week in the 1998 year. He denied signing an authority to deposit tax refund cheques into the account of Ramace to offset bookkeeping and accounting fees and repay the principal and interest on loan advances.

401In his evidence in chief the appellant said he met Mr Magoulias in late 1997. He said that Mr Magoulias told him he had a sole trading business, Master Marble & Granite, and he wished the appellant to do his business accounts, profit and loss statements and balance sheets. The appellant said that Mr Magoulias told him he also wanted the appellant to prepare tax returns for his wife and set up a computer with MYOB for his business. The appellant said he would charge him an annual fee of $5,000 or $6,000 being invoiced each month. The appellant said originally Mr Magoulias did not pay him the outstanding amounts but eventually he paid all fees due.

402The appellant stated that in about 1998 Mr Magoulias asked him to organise a home loan through St George Bank. The appellant said he charged a fee which was paid.

403The appellant also said Mr Magoulias asked for a one year loan for himself and his wife. He said there was a loan agreement but he did not have a copy. The loan was for about $28,000. The appellant stated that his standard interest rate was roughly 12% and that the loan to Mr and Mrs Magoulias was repaid in full in 1998 or 1999.

404The appellant stated that to obtain the bank loan with St George Bank Mr and Mrs Magoulias needed to complete their tax returns. The appellant said he discussed Mr Campos at Marrickville Accounting Services.

405The appellant stated that Mr Magoulias worked for Master Marble & Granite as the Operations Manager. It was incorrect to state that he worked for Ladadika or that he worked as a security guard. He said that the wage shown on the tax return was what Mr Magoulias earned from Master Marble & Granite and it was calculated on money drawn by him.

406In relation to Count 12, the appellant gave the same explanation as to how the mistaken identity of the employer came about, namely, that it was due to the name of Mr Magoulias being inserted on the Ladadika spreadsheet. He stated that the replacement group certificate was signed by Mr Giannakarous. He said the certificate was signed in his office in his presence where all the Ladadika replacement certificates were signed.

407The appellant was shown the 1997 profit and loss statement for Master Marble & Granite which showed a net profit of $2,836.80, although the appellant said that this statement was an interim and incomplete account.

408The appellant was also asked in chief about a facsimile sent from Ramace to St George Bank containing a 1997 tax return showing income of $46,574. The sole source of this income as it appears from the tax return was derived from the Master Marble & Granite business.

409The appellant described the document as an interim return sent to St George Bank in connection with a loan application. He said it was based on what he described as incomplete information, basically ""word of mouth"". He admitted that the document was not submitted to the Tax Office.

410The appellant stated that he had Mr Magoulias sign paper copies of the electronic tax return which he gave to Mr Campos. He stated that Mr Campos delivered a notice of assessment and refund cheque and that he called Mr Magoulias to tell him of the refund. 

411The appellant said that at the time that Mr Magoulias signed an authority to deposit form he owed Ramace some $38,000. He said he kept a ledger on MYOB but the ledger was gone when he got his computer back. The summary does not record any such ledger being on the computer.

412So far as Count 13 was concerned, the appellant referred to the varying profit and loss accounts for Master Marble & Granite, one used for the purpose of the return showing a loss of $29,847 and another showing a net profit of $54,469. He explained one was interim and one was the final statement. The appellant was also referred to a 1998 tax return prepared by him which showed a net income of $54,469. He stated that he prepared the document; he did not have to be an agent to prepare it.

413The appellant stated that this was an interim document and not submitted to the ATO. It should be noted that this return did not record any income being received from Ladadika or the existence of any tax deductions.

414In cross-examination in relation to Count 12, the appellant reaffirmed that it was a mistake to state that Mr Magoulias worked for Ladadika. He said the group certificate should have been from his own business, Master Marble & Granite. He acknowledged that Mr Magoulias' name did not appear on the Ladadika spreadsheet but stated that it was not final and that he would have updated the spreadsheet.

415The appellant was asked why, if Mr Magoulias was carrying on a business as a sole trader under the name Master Marble & Granite, part of the income from the business was declared as income derived from the business whilst another part was treated as wages from which instalments of tax were deducted. He stated he did that to show the business paid wages even though it was to the proprietor of the business. He stated that he believed that a group certificate could be issued to someone who works for himself. However, he acknowledged that you could not employ yourself and that self-employed persons have to show all their income in the business section of a tax return. He then gave the following evidence:

""Q. Can you fill out an employment declaration and give it to yourself?
A. If you want to get a group certificate from your own business, yes.

Q. Answer the question?
A. Yes.

Q. You can do that?
A. Yes.

Q. You can give yourself an employment declaration?
A. Yes, I believe you can.

Q. And if you fail to tell yourself your own tax file number you are in all sorts of strife, you have to pay tax at a higher rate?
A. Yes, you can choose -

Q. That is your evidence?
A. You can choose to pay tax at a higher rate.

Q. This is a load of nonsense, isn't it?
A. No, it's not.

Q, Master Marble & Granite, was that always a business name?
A. No.""

416The appellant agreed that in the 1997 year Master Marble & Granite was not incorporated. A search of the records of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) revealed it was incorporated on 5 June 1998.

417He was then cross-examined in relation to the 1997 return sent to St George Bank which showed all taxable income of $46,574 as being derived from Master Marble & Granite. He stated that he did not know why he sent the document to St George Bank but surmised it may have been because he was testing the software system. He was then asked whether or not he was defrauding St George Bank or the ATO to which he stated that he could not be sure that he sent the return to St George Bank.

418In relation to Count 13, the count relating to the tax return for the year ended 30 June 1998, it was put to the appellant that as Master Marble & Granite Pty Ltd was only incorporated on 5 June 1998, it was impossible for Mr Magoulias to have earned the $38,000 said to have been wages as an employee of that company in only 25 days. He stated that was incorrect. He said the company bought the business and the calculations were done on the basis that no employment declaration was signed.

419The appellant was then shown the three sets of figures showing different profit and loss statements for the business and said that he could not recall which one was correct. He was unable to explain why there was no version of a profit and loss account on his computer which recorded a loss. He reiterated that he was not trying to defraud anyone.

420The appellant was subsequently cross-examined by reference to documents seized from his office. He reiterated that he was entitled to keep the combined refunds of Mr and Mrs Magoulias which totalled approximately $38,000. He was reminded that his evidence was that the loan to Mr and Mrs Magoulias was for $15,000, however he said in cross-examination there was a further advance. He said he could not remember how much it was, but he believed he paid $25,000 to a real estate agent.

421The appellant was then shown an invoice from Ramace addressed to Mr and Mrs Magoulias recording that there was paid from funds held an amount of $7,780 in respect of brokerage fees, credit card fees and application fees. He acknowledged that he retained the tax refunds seven months or eight months before he sent the invoice. He said that this was because there was an agreement that he hold the funds.

422The appellant agreed that there was no reference on the invoice to any amount outstanding in respect of a loan made by him or Ramace to Mr and Mrs Magoulias.

423The appellant was also shown a facsimile from Ramace to St George Bank dated 1 June 1999 stating to enclose returns for S & L Magoulias for the 1998 year. The returns stated that Mr Magoulias earned net income of $54,469 from Master Marble & Granite. The appellant was not prepared to accept that the return formed part of the facsimile, notwithstanding the fact that that was consistent with what appeared from his files.

(c) Consideration

(i) Count 10

424It was accepted by the appellant that it was not correct that Mrs Magoulias worked for Ladadika as stated in the tax return. Rather, he stated that she worked for Master Marble & Granite, the business being carried on at that time by her husband, undertaking administrative work.

425The appellant said that the insertion of Ladadika as her employer was a mistake. He did not explain in chief how the mistake was made, although in cross-examination in relation to the 1998 tax return he stated that the replacement group certificate was based on the Ladadika spreadsheet. The appellant acknowledged, however, that her name did not appear on the spreadsheet. However, he sought to justify this by stating that two persons who in fact did work for Ladadika also did not appear on the spreadsheet. The two Ladadika employees identified by him as being those whose names did not appear on the spreadsheet were Mr Venieris and Mr Liontos. 

426In these circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware at the time he prepared the material for this tax return that Ladadika did not employ Mrs Magoulias as a Staff Development Officer. There is no foundation for the mistake as to the employer's name and nothing which would suggest that Mrs Magoulias was ever engaged as a Staff Development Officer. Further, it must be remembered that at the same time as the 1997 tax return for Mrs Magoulias was in the course of preparation, her 1998 tax return and both the 1997 and 1998 returns for Mr Magoulias were also being prepared. The appellant must have been aware from the preparation of these returns that Mr Magoulias was carrying on the business of Master Marble & Granite. Indeed, he had prepared a draft tax return for Mrs Magoulias for 1998 stating that her employer was Master Marble & Granite.

427I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Magoulias did not earn the amount claimed in her tax return for the 1997 year in question and that the tax instalment deductions were not made. Each of Mr and Mrs Magoulias denied such payments were made, saying that the only money Mrs Magoulias received from her husband was to pay household bills. There was no evidence to the contrary.

428Further, none of the profit and loss statements for the 1997 year prepared by the appellant for the Master Marble & Granite business showed any amount for wages and the appellant gave no evidence as to how he came to conclude that the tax instalment deductions were made.

429I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware the return was false. Both Mr and Mrs Magoulias denied they gave the appellant the information in the return and it is contrary to the profit and loss statements prepared by him. Further, as I indicated previously, the explanation as to how Ladadika came to be named as Mrs Magoulias' employer cannot be believed. 

430I am also satisfied that the appellant prepared the false information and the replacement group certificate for the purpose of obtaining a refund cheque for the benefit of Ramace. Although I am inclined to accept that Mr and Mrs Magoulias did not owe Ramace $38,000, it is unnecessary to reach a concluded view on this issue. Whatever the financial relationship between the appellant and Mr and Mrs Magoulias, I am satisfied that the appellant intended Ramace to retain the refund which in fact was what occurred.

431In these circumstances, I am satisfied on the evidence that the offence the subject of Count 10 has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

(ii) Count 11

432Similar considerations apply in respect to this count as for Count 10. For the reasons given in relation to Count 10, I am unable to accept that Mrs Magoulias was described as a Staff Development Officer employed by Ladadika by mistake.

433Further, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the figures in the return were false to the knowledge of the appellant. Both Mr and Mrs Magoulias denied they gave information to the appellant suggesting that Mrs Magoulias was paid $24,463 out of her husband's business. In addition, the profit and loss statement for Master Marble & Granite for that year prepared by the appellant which reflected what was contained in the tax return only made provision for casual wages in the sum of $5,201.

434In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the material in the return was false to the knowledge of the appellant.

435For the reasons given in relation to Count 10, I am also satisfied that the appellant prepared the material containing the false information for the purpose of obtaining a benefit for Ramace.

436It follows, in my opinion, that the evidence proved the offence the subject of Count 11 beyond reasonable doubt.

(iii) Count 12

437For the reasons given in relation to Counts 10 and 11, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the insertion of Ladadika as Mr Magoulias' employer in the tax return lodged in the 1997 year was not due to an honest mistake by the appellant. Rather, it was known by the appellant to be false. The appellant was aware that Mr Magoulias was conducting his own business in the year in question. 

438The appellant's explanation of how the replacement group certificate came to be prepared was unconvincing. He stated it was signed in his office by Mr Giannakarous. That ignores the fact that the return was not prepared until October 1998 well after Mr Giannakarous permanently left Australia.

439Further, the explanation of how wages and tax deductions were calculated was also unconvincing. The appellant's contention was that Mr Magoulias was paid wages from the business he was carrying on as a sole trader. I have set out the cross-examination on this issue in par [415] above. Although, of course, it is possible and in some cases necessary to pay tax by instalments over the year in question, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Magoulias in fact paid tax instalments much less chose to pay them at the highest possible rate. Mr Magoulias denied that this was the case.

440Further doubt is cast on the veracity of the figures by the fact that the tax return sent to St George Bank disclosing income earned by Mr Magoulias from the business of $46,574 (see par [417] above) did not assert that any tax had been deducted. It is not necessary to determine whether this tax return correctly set out the income earned by Mr Magoulias during the year in question or was designed to deceive St George Bank. What is significant is the absence of any tax deduction for purported wages.

441It is unnecessary to decide whether the business carried on by Mr Magoulias for the year in question incurred a loss of $15,655 as stated in the return, or a profit of $46,574 as stated in the return sent to St George Bank, or a loss of $14,920 or a profit of $2,837 as contained in two of the other profit and loss statements for that year prepared by the appellant. Mr Magoulias was not able to say with any certainty what he earned from the business for the year and in those circumstances it cannot be said that the loss referred to in the tax return was false to the knowledge of the appellant. However, the loss of itself would not have produced a tax refund without the claim that the tax instalments had been paid. As I have indicated, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this claim was false to the knowledge of the appellant.

442I am also satisfied for the reasons given in relation to Counts 10 and 11 that the appellant intended Ramace to profit from receipt of the tax refund which was received in relation to the 1997 and 1998 tax years.

443It follows that in my opinion the evidence proves the offence the subject of Count 12 beyond reasonable doubt.

(iv) Count 13

444For the reasons given in relation to Count 12, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement that Ladadika was the employer of Mr Magoulias in the 1998 tax year was false to the knowledge of the appellant. In addition, the appellant had prepared another tax return for Mr Magoulias for the 1998 tax year stating that the business of Master Marble & Granite made a profit of $54,469. This was described by the appellant as an interim return. Interim or otherwise, it did not show employment income from Ladadika or anyone else.

445In cross-examination on this count, the appellant seemed to suggest that the employment income was said to have been earned from employment with Master Marble & Granite Pty Ltd which was only incorporated on 5 June 1998. He asserted it was not impossible for Mr Magoulias to have earned $38,000 in wages from that company in the period between incorporation and the end of the financial year. His explanation was in the following terms:

""Because the company would have bought the business prior. So it would have bought all the debts and income and all the expenses for that period.""

446With respect that explanation was meaningless.

447As I indicated earlier at par [418], the basis upon which instalment deductions were calculated was because no employment declaration was signed. The appellant did not contend that the deductions had in fact been made or paid to the ATO as stated in the return. That explanation, particularly coming from an accountant claiming experience in relation to tax returns, is incapable of belief. The only conclusion that can be reached is that the appellant prepared the figures for wages and tax deductions used in the preparation of the return, including the replacement group certificate, knowing that they were false. For the reasons given in relation to Counts 10, 11 and 12 I am satisfied it was done to produce a profit for Ramace.

448It follows, in my opinion, that the evidence proves the offence the subject of Count 13 beyond reasonable doubt.

Count 54 - Mr Stelianos Mangafas - Income tax return for year ended 30 June 2000

(a) The summary

449The summary in respect of Count 14 shows that the tax return lodged on behalf of Mr Mangafas on 12 October 1998 stated that Mr Mangafas received income in the sum of $35,088 from Ladadika from which tax of $16,491.36 was deducted. It also shows that Mr Mangafas had a business loss of $14,494 from his business Stelianos Mangafas Financial Consultancy.

450The summary discloses that a refund of tax in the amount of $13,356 was received which was deposited into the bank account of Ramace. It also discloses that the appellant had in his possession a hardcopy electronic lodgement declaration for the 1998 income tax return showing income as $20,304 and tax instalment deductions of $16,491.36. His computer also held income and exp",2013-09-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762489,R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceAfter a five month trial in the Supreme Court with three co-accused, the respondent was found guilty on two counts of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth.  The counts as charged on the indictment were as follows:
Count 1:  Between about 1 January 1997 and 23 May 2001 the respondent conspired with Mr Robert Agius, Owen Daniel and two others to defraud the Commonwealth, contrary to sections 86(1) and 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.
Count 2:  Between 24 May 2001 and 23 October 2006 the respondent conspired with Mr Robert Agius, Owen Daniel and two others dishonestly to cause a loss, or dishonestly to cause a risk of loss, to the Commonwealth, knowing or believing that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk that the loss would occur contrary to s135.4 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment).
2The respondent was sentenced by the trial judge, Simpson J, on 23 August 2012 as follows:
Count 1:  Community Service work for 500 hours.
Count 2:  Imprisonment for 3 years commencing 23 August 2012 and expiring on 22 August 2015 with the respondent to be released on entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for three years.
3Initially the Crown relied upon a single ground of appeal:
That the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. 
4In the alternative, the Crown sought to rely upon additional grounds of appeal against the prospect that the Court might conclude that the case was one of specific error in sentencing, rather than manifest inadequacy.  No objection was made to those additional grounds.  Those additional grounds of appeal were:
Further or alternatively,2 Her Honour erred in finding that the offences, in the respondent's case, do not fall even near the worst category and in failing to find that they fall close to the worst category.3 Her Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the nature and circumstances of the respondent's offending and the need to impose adequate punishment.4 Her Honour gave excessive weight to the influence of Mr Daniel on the respondent's offending conduct.5 Her Honour erred in giving excessive weight to the personal circumstances of the respondent in determining the sentences imposed.
Factual Background
5The conspiracy, the subject of each count, originated in an accountancy firm in Vanuatu.  During the period of the conspiracy, Mr Agius was the senior partner of the firm and was resident in Vanuatu.  The conspiracy centred on a series or pattern of arrangements that concerned the preparation and lodgement of Income Tax Returns on behalf of Australian companies conducting businesses of various kinds.  A large number of Australian companies were invited to and did, participate.  The directors of eight of those companies gave evidence in the trial.  Those companies became involved via their association, professionally (as clients), with a New South Wales firm of accountants practising under the name of ""Owen  T Daniel and Company"" (ODC), of which the now deceased Mr Owen Trevor Daniel was the principal and in which the respondent was initially an employee, and from 2000, a partner.
6Throughout the trial, the arrangements were referred to as a ""scheme"".  The scheme was fraudulent.  What actually happened varied markedly from company to company and on occasions, departed substantially from what can be discerned as having been the original conception.
7At the heart of the scheme were fraudulent claims by Australian companies for income tax deductions, said to be for business expenses.  As designed, the scheme involved provision by the Australian company participants of invoices for specified services - usually identified as ""management and consultancy services"".  The wording on the invoices was selected, sometimes in conjunction with the company directors, to appear to be relevant to the nature of the business conducted by the relevant company.  These services were never provided by the invoicing company.  It was never intended that such services be provided.  The invoices were prepared on the letterheads of UK registered companies.  
8Notwithstanding that no such services were provided, the Australian companies made payments of the amounts on the invoices.  Payments were made to New Zealand bank accounts in the name of the UK invoicing companies.  The Australian companies entered the payments into their profit and loss (income and expenditure) statements.  The total of the expenses for the year, including the false entries, were then translated into the business expenses in the companies' Income Tax Returns, and (in accordance with the self assessment system operated by the Australian Taxation Office (""the ATO"")) resulted in reduction in the taxation for which the companies were assessed to be liable.  The false claims for business expense deductions constituted the fraud, the subject of the conspiracy in the first count, and the loss to the Commonwealth, the subject of the conspiracy in the second count.
9The money paid to the New Zealand accounts was, within a short period, transferred to other accounts, also held in New Zealand banks, in the names of finance companies based in Ireland.  The money was then, again within a short time, returned to Australia, usually to the personal accounts of the directors of the Australian companies.  It was returned under the guise of loans.  The purpose of returning the money in this way was to avoid it appearing in the records of the directors as income, with potential income tax liability.  The payment of money which was in reality the money of the companies, to the companies' directors, without it being declared for income tax purposes, was a secondary fraud or loss to the Commonwealth.  In some cases, the company directors transferred the money back to the company's accounts, recording the transfers as directors' loans.
10The scheme was therefore relatively simple.  It involved the payment of money by Australian companies in response to false invoices for services not received by the Australian companies and fraudulent claims of those amounts as deductible business expenses and the return to the directors personally of the money, masquerading as loans in order to avoid personal income tax.  
11Integral to the scheme was the maintenance of company accounting records that included the false transactions and the preparation of Income Tax Returns based on those false accounts.  This was done by the company directors with the assistance of ODC. 
12The scheme involved an elaborate trail of documentation.  That trail began with the invoices for services.  It also included letters from the Irish finance companies, reportedly responding positively to requests (which had never been made) for loan finance in specified sums, purported loan documents and further invoices, this time from the finance companies, purportedly representing interest charges on the draw down of the loans.
13This documentation was clearly designed to give an appearance of authenticity to the transactions in case of inquiry or investigation by the ATO.
14A variation of the scheme emerged in 2003.  It involved the provision to Australian companies of documents entitled ""Certificate of Insurance"".  These were alternatives to the invoices for management and consultancy services.  In other respects, this variation followed a similar pattern to that previously described.  The certificates of insurance, which were false, purported to specify the nature of the insurance, the amount of cover and the period of cover, together with the premium.  The Australian companies paid the amounts specified as the premiums to New Zealand accounts, most of the money was transferred to other New Zealand accounts, from which it was returned, again masquerading as loans, to the Australian company directors.  The Certificates of Insurance were created to provide apparent authentication of the insurance payments in the event of an inquiry by the ATO.
15Implementation of the scheme was haphazard and inept.  In many cases, invoices for services were not provided to the Australian companies.  In others, they were not provided until after the Australian company directors had pressed for their provision for the purpose of completing the company accounting records.  Frequently, the amounts on the invoices did not correspond with the payments that were made.  In some cases, the Australian companies made entries (false) in their accounts, purportedly representing payments to the UK companies for relevant services, but did not, in fact, send money to New Zealand.  These were simply false claims for deductible expenses.  They were not claims made in accordance with the design of the scheme, but they were a consequence of it and flowed directly from participation by those company directors.
16In each case, the Australian company directors were told that participation in the scheme required payment of a fee as ""start up costs"".  This varied from $8,000 to $12,000 over the period of the conspiracy and was deducted from the first payment.
17The most elaborate part of the scheme was the documentation designed to provide evidence that the money returned to the company directors constituted loans.  Commonly but not invariably, an Australian company director received, unsolicited, a letter from a finance company in Ireland, stating that a request made by the Director[s] for loan finance had been approved (no such request had, in fact, been made).  With this letter was a document entitled ""AUD$ facility"".  These documents on superficial assessment had the appearance of genuine commercial transactions.  They stated that finance was sought and offered ""for the purpose of debt restructuring"".  Usually the stated amount of the loan was $1 million. 
18These documents were created for the purpose of satisfying any ATO inquiry.  That the purported loans were shams was evident by two circumstances.  First, notwithstanding the quantum of the loans, no security was sought.  Second, the loan offers were accompanied by undated letters containing two palpably false statements - that the loans had been (fully) drawn down, and that the loans had been fully repaid.  These letters came to be known as ""letters of forgiveness"" or ""letters of comfort"".  
19Money was sent from the finance companies to the Australian company directors.  The amounts sent corresponded with the amounts purportedly paid in respect of the false ""management and consultancy"" fees claimed in the invoices, subject to deductions for administration expenses, and a single deduction, from the first payment, for ""start up"" costs.  This was the last step in the ""round the world trading scheme"".  
20Communications were substantially with the Vanuatu accounting firm Moore Stephens/PKF either through Mr Daniel, the respondent or other employees of ODC, or directly by the company directors.
21The nature and circumstances of the offending include the period over which it was perpetrated.  In the case of Mr Agius, it was a period of almost 10 years.  In the case of the respondent, a period of more than 7 years from the middle of 1999.  It came to an end only on the execution of search warrants by officers of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in October 2006.
22Mr Agius actively presented and promoted the scheme to clients of ODC.  He did this through his association with Mr Daniel.  He was in the practice of making regular visits to Australia and of making contact with Mr Daniel who identified and selected clients he considered suitable for participation.
23It was common for Mr Daniel to tell potential recruits to the scheme that the arrangements were legal and above board and had been scrutinised by the ATO auditors and had survived that scrutiny.  Notwithstanding the assurances given by Mr Daniel, in general the participants were in no doubt that the arrangements they were embarking upon were fraudulent in that they centred upon false claims for deductible expenses.  As a consequence, the directors of all but one of the eight companies identified in the trial, entered pleas of guilty to various charges of dishonesty.  Six of them have served terms of imprisonment.  In respect of the eight companies of which evidence was given, the financial loss was said to be in excess of $5 million.
24On 23 October 2006 a search warrant was executed by the AFP at the offices of ODC.  At about the same time search warrants were executed at the house of the respondent and other employees of ODC.  
Remarks on sentence
25The following findings of fact were made by her Honour.  None of these findings was challenged by the parties.
26The implementation of the arrangements was at all times under the direct control and supervision of Mr Agius.  He did this with the administrative support of employees of Moore Stephens/PKF in Vanuatu and also with the administrative support of employees of ODC including the respondent.
27The respondent's involvement began at an early stage.  He frequently communicated with client participants and with Moore Stephens/PKF, in the administration of scheme transactions.  By 9 July 1999 the respondent had a working knowledge of the arrangements whereby the scheme was implemented.  The respondent was very involved with a number of companies in the maintenance of the companies' accounts and the preparation of the fraudulent Income Tax Returns and he was well aware of the false records in the accounts and the fraudulent claims in the Income Tax Returns.
28On occasions the respondent determined or advised the amount of money that should be sent overseas.  On at least two occasions, he personally forwarded the ""letters of comfort"" to the directors with the advice that they keep the letters in safe places.
29Initially the respondent acted solely on the instructions of Mr Daniel.  He was during the period 1997 to 2001 (count 1) aware of the fraudulent nature of the arrangement.  The full appreciation of that fraudulent nature grew upon him gradually.  By 2001 he had a fair working understanding of the nature of the arrangements such that he could and did advise clients independently without recourse to Mr Daniel.  By 2001 the respondent had become a partner in the firm.  He was trusted by Mr Daniel, who presented him to clients as ""my right hand man"".
30In 2004 the respondent, on reading material disseminated by the ATO concerning overseas tax minimisation schemes, approached Mr Daniel to express his concerns and urge that no new clients be initiated into the scheme.  He was abruptly and discourteously rebuffed.  From that date, however, no further clients joined the scheme.
31In about 2003 the ATO began making inquiries into overseas transactions.  The respondent took an active role in organising fabricated responses to the audit of one of the companies, Tara.  In the case of that company, two meetings took place with officers of the ATO.  Immediately before the first Mr Daniel offered Tara's director, Ms Collette McKenna, a false story she could tell the ATO officers concerning her entry into the arrangement.  The respondent had no part in this fabrication but was aware of it.  He attended the meeting, aware that Ms McKenna had been advised by Mr Daniel to give untruthful replies to questions asked of her.  After that meeting, the respondent requested that Ms McKenna compile a document that had the appearance of a consultancy report emanating from the invoicing company, that corresponded with what appeared in the invoices - in other words, the respondent asked her to create false material in the hope that it would satisfy the ATO that the invoices were generally for ""consultancy services provided"".
32When Ms McKenna produced this document, the respondent created or was involved in the creation of a coversheet to provide added apparent authenticity.  The respondent arranged for invoices to be created but may not himself have created the invoices.  The respondent provided Ms McKenna with three documents purporting to be ""Consulting Agreements"".  They were also designed to mislead ATO auditors.  
33In relation to a company, ASS, the respondent participated in a ""role playing"" exercise on the evening before a scheduled meeting with ATO officers in April 2004.  A false story was concocted to explain the invoices relevant to that company.  False answers were provided by the respondent for the directors of Kylood Pty Limited and Jiess Pty Limited (Messrs Hili and Jones) when the ATO signalled its intention of making inquiries and required answers to pertinent written questions.  In the early stages, all of the respondent's participation was undertaken at and under the direction of Mr Daniel and not on his own initiative. 
34Her Honour found that the respondent was actively involved, and became more so as time went on, that he was well aware that he was involved in a fraudulent activity and that he was led into this by an unscrupulous, immoral and overpowering employer, Mr Daniel.
35For the purposes of s16A(2)(c) of the Crimes Act (Cth), her Honour found that both Agius and the respondent engaged in a course of criminal conduct that constituted the offences.  Company participants in the scheme filed false Income Tax Returns year after year with the connivance of both offenders.  This went on repeatedly over an almost 10 year period in the case of Mr Agius, and a 7 year period in the case of the respondent.
36Her Honour concluded:
""63 It is hardly necessary to say that offences such as these call for sentences containing a strong element of general deterrence. The need for individual deterrence (s16A(2)(j)) of the offenders is less obvious. I believe that it is unlikely that Mr Zerafa will require any further reminder of the need to avoid using his profession for fraudulent purposes.  Indeed, on his behalf it was put that it is likely that he will lose his professional status as an accountant, and will not have the opportunity to use his profession for that purpose.  ...  For the purposes of s 16A(2)(e), the immediate injury suffered by the Commonwealth was a very considerable loss of revenue.  In respect of the eight companies of which evidence was given, the financial loss was said to be in excess of $5 million.  But there is also an intangible loss. The Australian taxation system, based as it is on self-assessment, depends for its integrity upon the honesty of citizens. Of course, there will always be those who choose to cheat. They are cheating their fellow citizens, casting a greater burden on each of them. Further, when it is known that the system can be, and is, cheated, the very structures of society are damaged. The self-assessment system depends not only on the honesty of taxpayers, but on the confidence of taxpayers that others will make their proper contributions, or that, if they do not, they will be adequately punished.""  (ROS [63])
37Her Honour found that the two most important sentencing considerations, having regard to the role played by each offender, and the nature and circumstances of the offending were ""general deterrence and the need to impose adequate punishment"" [64].
38By reference to s16A(2)(m) - character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition - her Honour made the following findings in respect of the respondent.
39He was born in October 1975 and was married with two young children (aged 8 and 6 at the time of sentence).   He had no criminal convictions and her Honour was satisfied that his good character was a matter appropriate to be taken into account.  He commenced employment with ODC in 1997 when he was 21 or 22 years of age.  He had previously had very little employment experience and none in a professional office.
40Her Honour found that the environment into which he was inducted was morally poisonous and that Mr Daniel was a very corrupt man.  She noted that Mr Daniel was also gregarious, charming and charismatic and was generous to the respondent who was an impressionable and vulnerable young man.  Her Honour was satisfied that the respondent did not engage in the scheme of his own initiative, but did so under the malign influence of Mr Daniel.  Her Honour took into account, to his credit, that he did make an attempt in 2004 to persuade Mr Daniel to cease involvement and that notwithstanding Mr Daniel's rebuff, that attempt had the effect of limiting, if not bringing to an end, the participation of clients of the firm in the scheme.  Her Honour found that he was entitled to credit for that stand.
41Her Honour was satisfied that the respondent received no direct financial reward or benefit for his participation.
42Her Honour found:
""84 Mr Zerafa gave evidence in the trial over many days, and I had the opportunity to observe him in some detail. I should say at the outset, that I am satisfied that, in significant ways, the evidence that he gave was knowingly untrue. However, I also had some opportunity to make an assessment of his personal characteristics. I formed the view that, while he is intelligent, he lacked the strength to resist the overpowering personality of Mr Daniel. This may be due to family circumstances of which I have little evidence. He did give evidence that, at a critical time, he was almost estranged from his father, and this had the effect of driving him further into the sphere of influence of Mr Daniel.""  (ROS [84])
43It was not until eighteen months after the execution of the search warrants that the respondent was charged and five and a half years later that the trial commenced.  Her Honour found that both he and his wife had in the ensuing six years, suffered from depression and anxiety.  The family life had been severely affected.  The younger child was a baby when the search warrants were executed and the older child was aged two.  As a consequence, the children had never lived in a normal stress-free family environment.  One child exhibited very worrying behavioural tendencies.  Her Honour was satisfied that it was probable that a fulltime custodial sentence would produce significantly adverse and, in all probability, irremediable effects on the respondent's wife and his children.  Her Honour found that this in turn would make a period of incarceration more difficult for him [86].
44In relation to how she should use this finding, her Honour said:
""87 Uninstructed by authority, I would have considered that s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act both entitled and obliged me to take those family consequences into account.  However, binding authority requires me to take a different approach. Those circumstances may not be given substantial weight in the sentencing determination unless they can be categorised as ""exceptional"": R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522 at [9]-[17]; R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 143 A Crim R 286 at [31]. In Togias, Spigelman CJ seems to have taken the view that, although the words ""exceptional circumstances"" are not to be found in s16A(2)(p), nevertheless they have so consistently and repeatedly been notionally engrafted into the legislation by a number of State appellate courts that the time has passed for any court other than the High Court to reverse the trend.  In Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1, in a different context, the High Court rejected a construction that would have put an impermissible gloss on the text of s16A (at [19]; see also [25]-[27]). Nevertheless, Togias and Hinton state the law that I must apply. Powerful as the evidence of the impact on Mr Zerafa's family and dependents is, the circumstances here fall short of exceptional. I cannot allow s16A(2)(p) to guide the sentence to be imposed.""
45Her Honour accepted that it was likely that the respondent would lose his profession and livelihood because the professional bodies governing the accountancy profession had moved to strike his name from the relevant registers.  She considered that this was a significant extra-curial punishment which it was appropriate for her to take into account.  She concluded that besides the professional disgrace, it would bring with it a very heavy financial cost.
46In relation to culpability, her Honour rejected the Crown submission that his offences were close to a worst case.  She said:
""91 I accept that, objectively speaking, the offences are very serious, although I reject the contention that, in Mr Zerafa's case, they fall into the worst category, or even near it. I do accept that they involve a breach of the trust reposed in an accountant, both by the clients, by the community, and by the ATO. That breach of trust is, as I have indicated, somewhat ameliorated by the absence of any moral or ethical guidance on the part of Mr Daniel, who could have been expected, but entirely failed, to introduce Mr Zerafa to morally and ethically acceptable accounting practices. Mr Daniel used Mr Zerafa (and others in the practice) as instruments in a personal war he appeared to be conducting against the ATO. I do not accept that Mr Zerafa's participation approximates a worst case. That is particularly so, because of his youth and naivety, in relation to the period covered by the first offence.""
47Her Honour summarised her conclusions before passing sentence on the respondent.  She said:
""124 In Boughen and Cameron I made plain my views that those who defraud the revenue by tax evasion must pay the same heavy penalties as those who defraud the revenue by social security fraud. I do not resile from those views. Two circumstances distinguish those cases from that of Mr Zerafa. One is that such cases invariably involve and are perpetrated specifically for the purpose of financial gain to the offender. That is not here the case. The second is that they invariably involve a conscious and deliberate decision on the part of the offender to participate in the fraud. That also is not the case here. Mr Zerafa was drawn, quite insidiously, into the conspiracy by an older and stronger employer. I have already held that, by mid-1999, Mr Zerafa was very aware of the essential nature of the scheme. It is true, as the Crown submitted, that he could have confronted Mr Daniel, could have left the employment, and could have reported the conduct to the relevant authorities or professional bodies.  To hold that he ought to have done that is to ignore the realities of the situation in which he found himself.  Had he had more experience of the world when he came into Mr Daniel's orbit, he may well have been in a better position to evaluate the true character of his employer, and the degree to which the work he was required to do departed from acceptable professional practice, and to have resisted Mr Daniel. He did not have that experience. That, in my opinion, significantly diminishes his culpability.  In this context I place considerable store on his 2004 attempt to persuade Mr Daniel to abandon the scheme, and, indeed, the apparent success of those efforts despite Mr Daniel's arrogant and hostile response.""
48Her Honour also took into account that it was almost six years since the execution of the search warrants.  Her Honour qualified the effect of the delay because the evidence was complicated and detailed and because considerable additional delay was occasioned by unsuccessful applications of the four accused, for a stay of proceedings and appeals against the refusal of those applications.
Submissions
49It was common ground that despite the maximum penalty for count 1 being imprisonment for 20 years, and that for count 2 imprisonment for 10 years, the Executive Memorandum contained a clear acknowledgment that the maximum penalty under the Crimes Act was ""far too high"".  The parties accepted the approach in R v Ida Ronen, Nitzan Ronen, Izhar Ronen [2006] NSWCCA 123; 161 A Crim R 300 where the Court (Howie J with whom Spigelman CJ at Kirby J agreed) found that the situation was one where the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account that the maximum penalty prescribed (here count 1) was no longer an appropriate yardstick for the sentence to be imposed and had little relevance as a guide to the seriousness of the offender's conduct.  The Crown accepted that it was appropriate to take into account the significant diminution in the maximum available sentence as indicative of a change of attitude on the part of the legislature.  
50The Crown accepted that its right of appeal was an exceptional power to be exercised with restraint and in order to allow the Court to lay down sentencing principles (Griffiths v R [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293; Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 and R v MD, BM, NA and JT [2005] NSWCCA 342.  The Crown accepted these statement of principle:
""...  An appeal by the Attorney General should be a rarity, brought only to establish some matter of principle and to afford an opportunity for the Court of Criminal Appeal to perform its proper function in this respect, namely, to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.""  (Barwick CJ in Griffith at 310).
""The reference to ""matter of principle"" in that passage must be understood as encompassing what is necessary to avoid the kind of manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards which Barwick CJ saw as constituting ""error in point of principle"".""  (Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Everett at 300)
51The Crown noted that the most recent statement of principle in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ at [1] and [36] was to similar effect:
""1 The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (""Crown appeals"") under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Criminal Appeal Act"") is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons."" That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the ""residual discretion"".""
""36 A primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion is the purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D which, as observed earlier in these reasons, is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons."" That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.""
52Despite those limiting principles, the Crown submitted that this case fell within that permissible category of Crown appeals where the Court ought to intervene because the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate and created an inconsistency in sentencing standards.  The Crown submitted that this Court should intervene in order to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind, i.e. tax fraud.  The Crown submitted that taking into account all relevant matters, the sentences did not reflect the circumstances of the offences committed by the respondent and constituted an affront to community standards (R v Gallagher [1991] 53 A Crim R 248; 23 NSWLR 220 at 232).
53The Crown relied upon the summary of principles applicable to a Crown appeal against sentence provided by Refshauge J (with whom Penfold and Lander JJ agreed) in R v TW [2011] 6 Act LR 18 at [4] - [6].  Accordingly, the Crown submitted that occasions may arise for the bringing of a Crown appeal:
(a) When a sentence reveals such manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards as to constitute an error in principle.
(b) Where it is necessary for a Court of Criminal Appeal to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing a convicted person.
(c) To enable the Courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime.
(d) To enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crimes to be corrected.
(e) To correct a sentence which is so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience.
(f) To ensure, as far as the subject matter permits, that there will be uniformity of sentencing.
54As indicated, the Crown accepted the facts found by her Honour.  However, it submitted that her Honour did not give proper weight to those findings.  For example, the Crown accepted her Honour's finding as to the relationship between Mr Daniel and the respondent but not the weight given to it by her Honour.  By reference to her Honour's finding that in general the directors of the Australian client companies were in no doubt that the arrangements they were embarking upon were fraudulent, the Crown submitted that it was impossible for the respondent not to have known from the time of his first involvement in the scheme in about mid 1999, that at its core the scheme was fraudulent in the manner set out by her Honour.
55The Crown sought to demonstrate the inadequacy of the sentence by setting out the findings by her Honour as to the role of the respondent.  
(1) It began at an early stage.  He frequently communicated with client participants and with the Vanuatu firm of Mr Agius in the administration of the scheme transactions.  He was instrumental in making the initial arrangements to set up the structures for Tara.  He had a working knowledge of the scheme by early July 1999 [47].
(2) He was very involved with a number of the companies, the maintenance of their accounts and the preparation of fraudulent income tax returns and was well aware of the false records in the accounts and the fraudulent claims in the returns [48].
(3) On occasions he determined or advised the amount of money which should be sent overseas and on at least two occasions, he personally forwarded ""letters of comfort"" to the directors with the advice that they keep the letters in safe places [49].
(4) During the period 1997 - 2001 (count 1) he was aware of the fraudulent nature of the arrangements although it was possible, even likely, that his full appreciation of that fraudulent nature grew upon him gradually.  However, by 2001 he had a fair working understanding of the nature of the arrangements, such that he could and did, advise clients about the scheme independently without recourse to Mr Daniel [50].
(5) By 2001 he had become a partner in ODC.  He was trusted by Mr Daniel, who presented him to clients as ""my right hand man"" [51].  It was beyond doubt that by 2004 he was aware of the fraudulent nature of the arrangements [52].
(6) After the ATO began making inquiries into overseas transactions in about 2003, he took an active role in organising fabricated responses to the audit of Tara.  Her Honour set out in detail his conduct in this regard [53].  He was aware of Mr Daniel offering Ms McKenna a false story to tell the ATO officers.  After the audit meeting he requested that Ms McKenna compile a false consultancy report which appeared to conform with the company invoices.  In other words, he asked Ms McKenna to create false material in the hope that it would satisfy the inquiries of the ATO.  He provided a coversheet for this document and arranged for false invoices and false ""consulting agreements"" to be created so as to mislead the ATO auditors [53].
(7) In relation to ASS he participated in a ""role playing"" exercise on the evening before a scheduled meeting with ATO officers in April 2004 at which a false story was concocted to explain the invoices relevant to that company [54].
(8) In relation to the companies of which Messrs Hili and Jones were directors, similarly false answers were provided by him to the directors when the ATO signalled its intention of making inquiries and required answers to pertinent written questions [55].
56The Crown accepted that her Honour made strong findings in favour of the respondent in relation to subjective matters.  Her Honour was satisfied that in the early stages, his participation in the scheme was at and under the direction of Mr Daniel and not on his own initiative.  She was prepared to take into account the respondent's good character.  His participation in the criminal conduct was contributed to by his youth and inexperience and the morally bankrupt employment environment with which he became involved through Mr Daniel.  Nevertheless, the Crown submitted that her Honour had given excessive weight to these matters so that nothing less than a substantial sentence of fulltime custody was adequate to meet the circumstances of his offending.  The Crown submitted that a sentence was required which ""provides sufficient disincentive to others who may be tempted to offend, to ensure that they refrain from criminal activities"" (R v Podgson & Ors [2012] NSWCCA 225 at [143]).
57In relation to its primary complaint of manifest inadequacy, the Crown relied upon the statement of principle by the High Court in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [58] - [67] where the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:
""60 ...  But what reveals manifest excess, or inadequacy, of sentence is consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence.  ...""
""62 In the present matters, the inadequacy of the sentences imposed at first instance was evident from consideration of all of the matters that were relevant to fixing a sentence (and making a recognizance release order) ""of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". The chief considerations which pointed to inadequacy in these cases were the nature of the offending, and the sentences that had been imposed in cases most closely comparable with the present.
63 The applicants' offending was sustained over a long time. It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies. The applicants acted out of personal greed. The amount of tax evaded was not small. Detection of offending of this kind is not easy. Serious tax fraud, which this was, is offending that affects the whole community. As was pointed out in Ruha, the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the recognizance release orders that were made.""
58The Crown submitted that it was not without significance that Messrs Hili and Jones were clients of ODC and were directors of two of the companies involved in the scheme.  In a Crown appeal (R v Jones' R v Hili  [2010] NSWCCA 108; 76 ATR 249) this Court re-sentenced each of them to imprisonment for 3 years with a recognizance release order to take effect after 18 months.  The appeal to the High Court was dismissed.
59The Crown also relied upon another decision involving clients of ODC, R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17.  These directors participated in the scheme between 1997 and 2004.  They each evaded income tax of approximately $500,000.  In a Crown appeal, Simpson J (with whom Hislop and Latham JJ agreed) said:
""59 At least since 1996, when Brooking JA said: 

""The seriousness of the offence of defrauding the Commonwealth of a large sum of money by not declaring assessable income has in the past, perhaps, not always been sufficiently reflected in the sentences passed. Those who systematically defraud the Revenue of a large sum over a substantial period must in general expect a substantial custodial sentence. The deterrent and punitive effects of that sentence should not be unduly diminished by allowing release from custody at an unduly early stage."" ( R v Van Nhan Nguyen; Huu Duc Phan (1996) 86 A Crim R 521 at 525), 
appellate courts have consistently insisted that tax evasion offences ought to attract significantly deterrent sentences. This, properly, puts tax evasion into the same class of offending as social security fraud, which has an even longer history of insistence on custodial sentences. 
60 The earlier occasions on which social security fraud has been treated as an offence calling for significantly deterrent sentences are catalogued in the decision of this Court in R v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141 pp 145-146. Lee J quoted from the judgment of Street CJ in R v Luu (unreported, NSWCCA 7 December 1984): 

""The courts of this State have uniformly sought to make plain to persons who abuse the system of social welfare that they must expect to face heavy penalties. The introduction into the administration of that system of overly meticulous preliminary checks before benefits are paid could result in real hardship to persons whose need for benefits is urgent and immediate. Thus it is that such susceptibility is open to abuse, which results in persons who do abuse it receiving salutary penal consequences at the hands of the Court."" 
To the same effect is the decision of this Court in R v Purdon (unreported, NSWCCA, 27 March 1997). This approach to social security fraud cases has been consistent in this State and others: see eg R v Medina (unreported, NSWCCA 28 May 1990); R v Carroll [1991] 2 VR 509; R v Cameron; R v Simounds (unreported, SACCA, 19 July 1993); Kovacevic v Mills [2000] SASC 106; 174 ALR 77.""
60The Crown noted that Messrs Boughen and Cameron received sentences from this Court of imprisonment for 3 years with a recognizance release order to operate after 18 months.  Those were sentences imposed after a 50 percent discount for assistance and a plea of guilty.
61Her Honour while adhering to the views which she expressed in R v Boughen; R v Cameron distinguished the respondent's position in that he had not received any financial gain from his participation in the scheme and because his initial participation had not involved a conscious and deliberate decision on his part, but rather he had been drawn insidiously into the conspiracy by an older and stronger employer.  The Crown challenged that reasoning.  It submitted that while it could not identify any financial gain, it strained credulity to accept that he did not expect some benefit, even if that benefit were intangible, e.g. the continuation of his employment with the firm, both as an employee and as a partner.
62The Crown submitted that her Honour's first point of distinction failed to take into account his breach of trust as a professional accountant, registered tax agent and partner in an accounting practice directly enabling clients to defraud the Revenue.  It also failed to have regard to the matters referred to at [63] in Hili and Jones.  The Crown submitted that it failed to have regard to the offending conduct in relation to Ms McKenna and the company, ASS.  The Crown submitted that the absence of personal greed did little, in the circumstances of this case, to detract from the objective criminality of the offending.  It submitted that the respondent was a critical vehicle through which the scheme operated.  
63In relation to the second point of distinction the Crown submitted that even it were given full weight, the sentences were manifestly inadequate.  The Crown submitted that the respondent was not deprived of his free will by the corrupting influence of Mr Daniel, nor was there evidence that his will was relevantly overborne by Mr Daniel during the whole period of the offending, particularly after 2004 when he actively engaged in conduct to deceive officers of the ATO.  The Crown submitted that the respondent's study and training as an accountant and as a member of the Chartered Institute of Accountants, as well as his registration as a tax agent, must have made him aware of the seriously dishonest nature of his conduct and serious breach of professional trust and the trust of the community by abusing the Australian self assessment tax system.  The Crown submitted that these factors well outweighed the ameliorating aspects of his youth and inexperience when he first came in contact with Mr Daniel.
64The Crown noted that in Hili and Jones, the High Court had accepted Ly v R [2007] NSWCCA 28 as a case which could provide some guidance as to an appropriate sentence to be imposed on participants in a tax fraud scheme.  The Crown submitted that Ly v R had particular relevance to this case because the offender was a tax agent who lodged false income tax returns on behalf of tax payer clients as a consequence of which he fraudulently obtained 49 tax refunds totalling approximately $329,000 in a two year period.  The Crown noted that he received a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years, with a non-parole period of 4 years after a discount of 25 percent for his plea.  The Crown submitted that with the respondent there had been no plea, no co-operation in the investigation of the offences and no remorse, although there had been a degree of co-operation in the conduct of the trial.  The Crown submitted that the offending conduct of Ly as recorded at [13] of the judgment was similar to but not as extensive as that of the respondent.
65The Crown referred the Court to R v Wheatley [2007] 67 ATR 531 where the offender had been sentenced by a judge of the County Court of Victoria to 2 ½ years imprisonment for evading tax of about $318,000 by what were described as ""complex arrangements to funnel Australian earned funds offshore, under the guise of authenticity"" (at [69]).  The Crown noted that the sentencing judge held that the offending was found to have been due to need not greed.  The offender received a sentence of imprisonment for 2 ½ years with a recognizance release order to take effect after 15 months.
66In relation to the alternative grounds of appeal, the Crown did not make separate submissions but noted that these matters had been covered in its submissions in relation to the primary ground of manifest inadequacy.
Respondent's submissions
67The respondent advised the Court that he had completed the 500 hours of community service work.  Thirteen months of the suspended sentence had passed without incident.
68The respondent submitted that the delay in this matter had been extensive.  The search warrants were executed in 2006 but he was not charged until 2008.  The trial did not take place until 2012.  He submitted that even the appeal proceedings had been delayed in that they were originally fixed for hearing in February 2013.  The respondent relied upon her Honour's finding [86] that this delay had contributed to the development of depression and anxiety in him and his family and that the family has been severely affected.  He referred to her Honour's specific finding that the two children had never lived in a normal stress free family environment and that one child had exhibited ""very worrying behavioural tendencies"".  The respondent submitted that these were matters which were properly taken into account by her Honour as being a product of the delay in the finalisation of the criminal proceedings against him (R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; 136 A Crim R 451; R v Cheung [2010] NSWCCA 244; 203 A Crim R 398).
69The respondent submitted that the significant delay was an important consideration in her Honour's judgment.  He submitted that it was also an important factor to be taken into account in answer to the Crown's submission that a custodial sentence should now be imposed.  He submitted that 7 years had passed since the search warrants were executed, that he and his family had been living in a state of anxiety during that period and that the family had now come to terms with his conviction and the sentence which had been imposed.  He submitted that the significant extent of the delay would make it cruel and unfair to both him and his family to now impose a custodial sentence.
70The respondent submitted that the imposition of a custodial sentence at this time would fail to have regard to the extra curial punishment to which he had been subjected.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants had moved to strike his name from the relevant register so that he would in due course lose his profession and his livelihood.  He submitted that this was a very substantial punishment and was correctly noted by her Honour [88] as militating against a custodial sentence.
71The respondent relied upon her Honour's error in refusing to consider whether the imposition of an Intensive Correction Order (ICO) was an appropriate sentence for him.  Her Honour concluded that such an order was not appropriate since an ICO was directed to the rehabilitation of an offender and he was not in need of rehabilitation.  Such an approach has now been expressly disproved in R v Pogson; R v Lapham; R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225.  The respondent submitted that in the context of this appeal, her Honour's approach had operated to his disadvantage in that her Honour may well have imposed an ICO in respect of either or both of the counts of which he was convicted.
72The respondent submitted that in accordance with s16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) a fulltime custodial sentence, if imposed by this Court, would have a most adverse effect on his family.  In that regard, he submitted that in her Honour's discussion of this matter at (see [44] hereof) her Honour had erred by following R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 552; 127 A Crim R 23 and R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286. On that issue, the respondent noted that her Honour had found [86] that ""I am satisfied that it is probable that a fulltime custodial sentence would produce significantly adverse, and, in all probability, irremediable, effects on Mr Zerafa's wife and his children"".  Even so, her Honour did not regard that as ""exceptional"".
73The respondent submitted that R v Togias and R v Hinton were wrongly decided and that not only should they not have been followed by her Honour, but they should not be followed by this Court.  The respondent submitted that should this Court decide that he be re-sentenced, it was necessary for the Court to properly interpret and apply s16A(2)(p) and to give the evidence on that issue full force and effect, regardless of whether the evidence could be properly categorised as ""exceptional"".  The respondent submitted that if this Court did so, such a factor would render a fulltime custodial sentence inappropriate.
74The respondent developed his argument as follows.  Section 16A(2)(p) provides that where it is known to the court, the court must take into account ""the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants"".  He submitted that the decisions in Togias and Hinton required that despite the wording of s16A(2)(p), the hardship be ""exceptional"" before it could be taken into account on sentence.  He submitted that such an interpretation was not authorised by the wording of the subsection.
75The respondent submitted that Bui v DPP (Commonwealth) [2012] HCA 1; 244 CLR 638 held that it was necessary to interpret the language of s16A to determine whether common law principles were picked up.   Bui v DPP held that the principle of ""presumed anxiety"" was not a matter listed in s16A and that a court could not have regard to it on re-sentencing.  Although the decision in Bui was not directly on point, the respondent submitted that it was clear from the reasoning that the statutory language of s16A must be applied according to its clear terms.  If that approach is correct, the respondent submitted that Togias and Hinton were wrongly decided.
76In the alternative, the respondent submitted that there was no real uniformity in approach to s16A(2)(p) in NSW.  Although the decisions in Togias and Hinton were regarded as stating the law in NSW, they had not been followed in R v Nguyen [2006] NSWCCA 369; 166 A Crim R 124.  There, James J (with whom Hidden and Hislop JJ agreed) citing R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 and R v X [2004] NSWCCA 93 at [24] said:
""27 It was submitted by the Crown that, accepting that X and Girard had been correctly decided and should be applied in the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders, all that those cases had decided was that hardship to members of an offender's family, while it could be taken into account as a part of the general subjective facts, could not be used to justify any substantial reduction in sentence, unless it was truly exceptional.  In my opinion, this submission is in accordance with the parts of Sully J's judgment in X and Hodgson JA's judgment in Girard which I have quoted and should be accepted.""
77The respondent did accept that on this issue, the courts of Victoria had followed Togias (Markovic v R, Pantelic v R [2010] VSCA 105; 30 VR 589, DPP v Bui [2011] VSCA 61).  The respondent also accepted that the Courts of Queensland had followed Togias (R v Huston; ex parte Cth DPP; R v Fox; ex parte Cth DPP; R v Henke; ex parte Cth DPP [2011] QCA 350; 219 A Crim R 209 R v Jones [2010] NSWCCA 108; 76 ATR 249).  He did, however, note that the Supreme Court of the ACT (DPP v Ka-Hung Ip [2005] ACT CA 24) expressly disavowed any reliance upon Togias and that the position in South Australia was not clear (R v Berlinsky [2005] SASC 316) nor was the position in Western Australia (Thi Nga Nguyen [2001] WASCA 72 and Nguyen v The Queen [2001] WASCA 119).
78On the basis of the contradictory authority in the States of Australia, and the clear approach of the High Court in Bui, the respondent invited this Court to overrule Togias or alternatively, not to follow it and to apply s16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) according to its wording, both when considering the submissions of the Crown and, should it become necessary, when determining to re-sentence him.
79The respondent submitted that her Honour had taken into account all relevant considerations in a detailed judgment and had appropriately exercised her sentencing discretion.  He submitted that the points of distinction identified by her Honour between this case and cases such as R v Boughen; R v Cameron were valid.  The absence of any financial gain by him, together with his youth, impressionability and vulnerability when he commenced employment with ODC were important distinguishing features.  The respondent submitted that it was open to her Honour to give substantial weight to his attempt in 2004 to dissuade Mr Daniel from continuing with the scheme.  He submitted that the cases relied upon by the Crown, i.e. Boughen and Cameron, Ly and Hili and Jones were readily distinguishable on their facts.  The respondent submitted that a suspended sentence was a serious form of punishment in that it carried the threat of imminent imprisonment should its conditions be breached (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321; R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17).
Consideration
80I have concluded that this is an appropriate matter for a Crown appeal.  Her Honour's sentencing judgment, and the issues raised by the parties, involve matters of principle which this Court should deal with ""for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"" (Griffiths v R [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 (per Barwick CJ)).
81While being mindful that a Crown appeal against sentence is an appeal against the exercise of a sentencing judge's discretion, I have also concluded that the Crown appeal in this matter should be upheld and that it will be necessary to re-sentence the respondent.  I have concluded that the sentences reveal such manifest inadequacy as to constitute an error in principle.
82Her Honour made a number of significant factual findings which set out in detail the criminality involved in the respondent's offending.  These were conveniently collected by the Crown in its submissions (see [55] hereof).  In summary, the offending covered seven years.  Other than in the conduct of the trial, there was no co-operation in the investigation of the offences and no contrition.  His involvement with the scheme was substantial.  After the ATO commenced investigations, he actively sought to thwart those investigations.  His actions over that period were the very antithesis of his obligations as an accountant.
83The characterisation by the Queensland Court of Appeal (Muir, Chesterman JJA and Margaret Wilson AJA) of the conduct under consideration in R v Huston is (except for the element of personal gain) appropriate to the respondent's offending.
""[57]  The offending here was serious, protracted, deliberate and grossly dishonest. It was embarked upon in the case of Henke and Huston for personal gain. It put at risk about $4.5 million of Commonwealth revenue. The criminal conspiracy involved elaborate attempts at concealment and disguise. Two of the conspirators were accountants who must have understood the gravity of their criminal misconduct. The third (Henke) was a registered tax agent. Such persons, more than most, must know of the need for taxing statutes to be applied uniformly according to their terms, and the consequences of subverting their uniform application. The effect of evading taxation liability is to deprive the community of revenue needed to provide government services and to impose an unfair burden on those who act honestly.
[58]  Sentences in these cases must do more than pay lip service to the need for general deterrence. They must be effective deterrents, and address the reality that conspiracy to evade tax is a form of corruption which has an insidious corroding effect on society. They must as well vindicate honest taxpayers.""
84Her Honour recognised many of these considerations when she referred to not only the immediate loss of revenue suffered by the Commonwealth, but what she described as ""an intangible loss"" which encompassed, in effect, an attack on the Australian taxation system and the cheating of fellow citizens (see [36] hereof).  
85Her Honour observed:
""64 ...  The two most important sentencing considerations, having regard to the role played by each offender, and the nature and circumstance of the offending, are general deterrence and the need to impose adequate punishment.""
Unfortunately, the sentences imposed on the respondent failed to reflect those considerations and were not of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offending.
86The matters of distinction identified by her Honour between this case and that of Boughen and Cameron while important, were not sufficient to justify the sentences which were imposed.  As the Crown submitted, while there may not have been any direct financial gain derived by the respondent from the scheme, there was obviously an indirect benefit in relation to his position in ODC and being regarded by Mr Daniel as his ""right hand man"".
87The circumstances leading to the respondent's involvement in the scheme, the continuing baleful influence of Mr Daniel and the respondent's intervention in 2004 to prevent new clients entering the scheme were important matters for her Honour to take into account in sentencing.  They did not, however, answer the fact of the respondent's continuing involvement with the scheme until 2006 when he was in his thirties, nor did they answer his efforts to mislead officers of the ATO once it had commenced its investigations into the scheme.  They did not answer his absence of remorse, as illustrated by her Honour's finding [84] that in significant ways the evidence which he gave at trial was knowingly untrue.  Despite the influence of Mr Daniel, there was no suggestion of any duress in relation to the respondent's continuing participation in the scheme.
88There is no doubt that delay in the prosecution of an offence in many cases will be a matter of mitigation to be taken into account in sentencing a convicted person.  Weight needs to be given in those circumstances to the effect on the convicted person of that delay.  
89Notwithstanding, it has been recognised that in cases involving complex financial transactions, account has to be taken of the difficulty of proof.  In R v Kearns [2003] NSWCCA 367, a case involving the improper use by the offender of his position as an officer of a corporation, contrary to s232(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), it was held that the sentencing judge did not err in failing to take into account a delay of four years between the offence and the commencement of proceedings.  Spigelman CJ (with whom the other members of the court agreed) said:
""68 In the present case, I do not see that the delay was of such an order of magnitude as to conclude that any significant unfairness arose of a character that needed to be identified and adverted to by the trial judge in the sentencing task. There was a process of investigation by the Australian Securities Commission that continued for some years prior to the laying of charges. The period of some three and a half years for the process of investigation and determination of which charges could be pursued does not, in the circumstances, appear to me to be so excessive as to constitute a factor that is required to be taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.""
90The delay in this matter coming to trial was substantial.  However, her Honour found [125] that this was not due to fault on the part of the Crown.  The evidence was complicated and detailed which was to be expected in a five month trial with four accused where liability was fully contested.  As her Honour noted:
""Some considerable additional delay was occasioned by applications, unsuccessful, made on behalf of the four accused for a stay of proceedings, and appeals against the refusal of these applications.""
91In any event, her Honour did take into account, as has this Court on re-sentencing, that there had been a substantial delay and that this caused considerable stress and anxiety to the respondent and his family.  The circumstances of that delay, however, were not such as to prevent either her Honour or this Court from imposing an appropriate sentence as required by s16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
92While I accept the relevance of the extra curial punishment likely to be suffered by the respondent as a mitigating factor, its effect is limited.  As with insider trading cases, it must have been anticipated by the respondent that an inevitable consequence, if his offending were discovered and successfully prosecuted, would be that he would be struck off the role of chartered accountants as not being a fit and proper person to pursue that profession.  This was a risk which the respondent chose to take when he facilitated the operation of the scheme for 7 years.
93In relation to s16A(2)(p) it is not appropriate for this Court to overrule or depart from cases such as Togias and Hinton.  As the respondent accepted, the ""exceptional hardship"" approach has been followed in Queensland and Victoria, and to a limited extent in South Australia and Western Australia.  It is only the ACT which has refused to follow that line of authority.  As Spigelman CJ acknowledged in Togias:
""17 If there is to be any change in this position, and that was not put in this case even on a formal basis, only the High Court can effect it.""
94The Court had before it not only the report of a psychologist, Ms Adams, dated 15 August 2012 which was before her Honour, but a more recent report, dated 18 February 2013 and affidavits from the respondent and his wife.  These last three documents were before the Court on a contingent basis, i.e. they were to be read if the Court decided to re-sentence the respondent.  
95The first report of Ms Adams focused not so much on the effect on the respondent's wife and two children if he received a custodial sentence, but on the anxiety and distress caused to the family by the ""invasion of their home"" by members of the AFP executing a search warrant in 2006 and the effect of the delay in the proceedings being finalised.  Ms Adams also noted that any time that the respondent spent in prison would be made worse for him because he would be aware of how much his wife and children were suffering.  Of course those latter considerations could be taken into account in sentence proceedings quite independently of s16A(2)(p) and were in fact taken into account by her Honour.  They have been taken into account by this Court in re-sentencing.
96The recent report from Ms Adams and the affidavits focused more on the effect on the respondent's wife and children if he is re-sentenced to a period of imprisonment.  Ms Adams reported the respondent as suffering from increased anxiety and sleeplessness.  His wife has become very anxious and is unsure how she will cope if he is sent to prison.  The respondent's son, aged nine, has become anxious and there is a probability that he will display nervous behaviour in such a circumstance.  The affidavit material confirms that history and prognosis.
97I am not satisfied on my reading of this material that even if those parts which related to the effect of the respondent's incarceration on his family were taken into account on sentencing, it would significantly affect the outcome.  As her Honour concluded, those circumstances do not amount to ""exceptional"" hardship.  Except for the nervous symptoms likely to be experienced by the respondent's son, it is the sort of reaction that one would expect from most close families if a father received a prison sentence.  Accordingly, even if as the respondent urged upon the Court, hardship to third parties was taken into account in the sentencing process, it would not operate to significantly mitigate the sentence which should be imposed.
98I do not accept as was submitted by the Crown that the respondent's offending was in the worst category for offences of this kind.  His offending was serious as her Honour found, but not of that level.  Accordingly, my reason for intervening is that her Honour failed to give sufficient weight to general deterrence and the need to impose adequate punishment.  I am satisfied that her Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried and that her reasoning over-valued the respondent's personal circumstances and particularly the effect of Mr Daniel's influence.  For the same reasons it is not appropriate to exercise the Court's residual discretion and to decline to intervene.
99The result is that the sentences are substantially more lenient than the offending called for and that the sentencing discretion must be re-exercised by this Court.  The seriousness of the offending and his breach of trust as an accountant have to also be adequately taken into account.
100Some assistance is provided by the decisions in Boughen and Cameron, Hili and Jones and Ly.  The sentence imposed on Mr Agius of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months is also of assistance.  The facts of these cases differ in a number of respects from this case.  The respondent has a stronger subjective case, particularly in relation to his introduction to criminality under the influence of Mr Daniel.  Accordingly, while these cases provide some assistance, the respondent has to be sentenced by reference to his particular offending and his particular personal circumstances.
101I am also mindful that this is a Crown appeal and there has been substantial delay so that there is a need for judicial restraint.  In oral submissions, the Crown accepted that in relation to count 1 the sentence of 500 hours of community work was within the range of appropriate sentences for that offending, but at the very bottom.  In respect of count 2, the Crown urged that only a custodial sentence would be appropriate and that the sentence would need to be significant.  I agree.  Nevertheless the sentence which I propose is also towards the bottom of the range.
102The orders which I propose are:
(1) Crown appeal allowed.
(2) The sentences imposed by Simpson J on 23 August 2012 are quashed.
(3) In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced as follows:
In respect of Count 1, the sentence imposed by Simpson J is confirmed.
In respect of Count 2, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months, commencing 23 August 2012 and expiring 22 February 2016 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, expiring 22 November 2014.
103LATHAM J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
104BEECH-JONES J:  I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL which comprehensively surveys the landscape of this appeal.  His Honour finds that the sentence imposed by Simpson J was manifestly inadequate and that it is appropriate for this Court to intervene and re-sentence the respondent to a custodial sentence.  I agree with that course and, subject to what follows, his Honour's reasons for doing so.
105Hoeben CJ at CL proposes that an appropriate sentence for the respondent on count 2 is one of three years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and three months backdated to the date he was sentenced.  This term, backdated as it is, represents a lenient sentence for the respondent.  The level of criminality involved was significant.  He and others implemented a fraud on the Commonwealth over a very long period.  The suggestion that he was overborne by the principal of the accounting firm, Mr Daniel, does not substantially diminish his criminality given the length of time over which the conduct occurred, his personal circumstances and his status as a professional.  Professional persons are meant to resist pressure to act unethically. Otherwise the significance of general deterrence in the punishment of so-called ""white collar criminals"" is well recognised (R v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315; 152 A Crim R 548 at [44] to [47] per Wood CJ at CL).
106Further, as is evident from the cases discussed in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [57] to [65], the sentences imposed on some of the clients of his accounting firm that implemented the scheme the firm marketed are only moderately less than the sentence that is proposed for the respondent.  In addition to those cases I also note that in R v Hawkins [2013] NSWCCA 208 this Court upheld a Crown appeal against one of those clients and imposed a series of sentences that cumulated to a combined sentence of six years and a non-parole period of three years and six months. That offender was convicted after a trial of one offence under s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and seven offences under s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) each of which carried a maximum penalty of ten years.  He received an identified tax benefit of approximately $600,000.00 (at [12]) which corresponded with the loss occasioned to the Commonwealth.  In the respondent's case he contributed to the occasioning of a loss of in excess of $5 million to the Commonwealth.  Although there was no identifiable gain accruing to the respondent from participating in the fraudulent scheme, as noted by Hoeben CJ at CL at [86], there was an obvious indirect benefit flowing to the respondent from his actions in terms of his position in his accounting firm.
107Ordinarily these matters would suggest that a sentence that exceeded that proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL might be warranted.  Nevertheless I agree with the sentence proposed by his Honour, bearing in mind one further matter.  This concerns the relevance, if any, of an unchallenged finding made by Simpson J in the emphasised portion of the following passage:
""Both [the respondent] and his wife have, in the six years since the execution of search warrants that signalled the commencement of these proceedings, suffered from depression and anxiety. Their family life has been severely affected. The younger child was a baby when the search warrants were executed. The older child was two years old. As a consequence, the children have never lived in a normal, stress-free family environment. One child has exhibited very worrying behavioural tendencies. I am satisfied that it is probable that a fulltime custodial sentence would produce significant adverse, and, in all probability, irremediable, effects on Mr Zerafa's wife and his children. That, in turn, would make a period of incarceration more difficult for him.  Of course, those who commit criminal offences must live with the consequences to themselves, and to those closest to them."" (emphasis added)
108This finding was sought to be supported by further evidence tendered on the appeal against the contingency that the Court decides to intervene and re-sentence the respondent as I consider it must. This evidence is summarised by Hoeben CJ at CL at [94] to [96].  I refer to the nature of the consequences envisaged by the unchallenged finding and expanded upon by the further evidence below.
109In her sentencing judgment Simpson J described the relevance of this finding in the passage extracted by Hoeben CJ at CL at [44] but which for convenience I will again set out:
""Uninstructed by authority, I would have considered that s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act both entitled and obliged me to take those family consequences into account. However, binding authority requires me to take a different approach. Those circumstances may not be given substantial weight in the sentencing determination unless they can be categorised as 'exceptional': R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522 at [9]-[17]; R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 143 A Crim R 286 at [31]. In Togias, Spigelman CJ seems to have taken the view that, although the words 'exceptional circumstances' are not to be found in s 16A(2)(p), nevertheless they have so consistently and repeatedly been notionally engrafted into the legislation by a number of State appellate courts that the time has passed for any court other than the High Court to reverse the trend. In Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1, in a different context, the High Court rejected a construction that would have put an impermissible gloss on the text of s 16A (at [19]; see also [25]-[27]). Nevertheless, Togias and Hinton state the law that I must apply. Powerful as the evidence of the impact on Mr Zerafa's family and dependents is, the circumstances here fall short of exceptional. I cannot allow s 16A(2)(p) to guide the sentence to be imposed.""
110During argument there was debate about whether these comments meant that Simpson J felt constrained by authority to not give the probable effects on the respondent's family of his incarceration any weight on the one hand or any determinative or substantial weight on the other. Given that this Court is proposing to re-sentence, it is not necessary to resolve that debate about her Honour's reasons.  However the debate highlights some uncertainty in the authorities about the proper construction or manner of application of s 16A(2)(p).
111Senior Counsel for the respondent, Mr Game SC, sought to draw on the unchallenged finding and the further evidence as one of many factors warranting leniency being exercised in favour of his client if the Court proceeded to re-sentence his client.  To that end he made two submissions concerning s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act.  First, he contended that the two judgments referred to in the above extract, namely R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; 127 A Crim R 23, and R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286, which construed s 16A(2)(p) as requiring hardship to third parties to be ""exceptional"" before it can be taken into account, were wrongly decided and should not be followed. In that context he accepted that the hardship that would be occasioned to his client's family in the event that he was sentenced to a custodial sentence would not meet the description of ""exceptional circumstances"", as discussed in the authorities.
112Second, he submitted that, even if Togias and Hinton were not overruled, the subsequent decision of this Court in R v Nguyen [2006] NSWCCA 369; 166 A Crim R 124 at least enabled some weight to be given to the probable hardship to the respondent's family as found by Simpson J.
R v Edwards
113In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516 Gleeson CJ described the following passage from the judgment of Wells J in R v Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 291 as the ""most frequently cited Australian judgment on [the] subject"" of the relevance of the impact of incarceration of an offender on third parties:""The argument thus presented to us raises the following question: When (if ever), and to what extent (if at all), should the hardship caused, directly or indirectly, by a proposed sentence of imprisonment, to the family of, or to others closely associated with, the offender be taken into account by the Court in mitigation of that sentence?
... Hardship to spouse, family, and friends, is the tragic, but inevitable, consequence of almost every conviction and penalty recorded in a Criminal Court. ... It seems to me that courts would often do less than their clear duty - especially where the element of retribution, deterrence, or protection of society is the predominant consideration - if they allowed themselves to be much influenced by the hardship that prison sentences, which from all other points of view were justified, would be likely to cause to those near and dear to prisoners.
But it has been often remarked that the strength of our law lies in the willingness of judges, when applying a principle, not to carry it past the point where a sense of mercy or of affronted common sense imperatively demands that they should draw back. So it is proper that I should here add that, in my opinion, hardship likely to be caused by a sentence of imprisonment under consideration ought to be taken into account where the circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be, in effect, inhuman to refuse to do so. For example, if it were demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that to send a man to prison would, without much doubt, drive his wife to suicide, it would be a steely-hearted judge who did not, however illogically, at least try to meet the situation by suitably framed orders as to penalty. But further than that, in my judgment, courts should not go.""  (emphasis added)
114Although Wells J warns against sentencing judges being ""much influenced"" by the hardship that would be occasioned to an offender's family by their incarceration, the principle stated by his Honour goes further.  It only allows the hardship likely to be caused to families to be taken into account when the circumstances are ""highly exceptional"" (cf R v Kertebani [2010] NSWCCA 221 at [65]).  On its face the principle stated by Wells J in Wirth does not permit hardship falling short of exceptional to be considered as a factor warranting any consideration as part of the process of ""instinctive synthesis"" undertaken in sentencing an offender (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357).
115Edwards was a Crown appeal against a sentence of periodic detention for manslaughter that was imposed because of the hardship the offender's full time custody would cause to a long term patient at an institution who was cared for by the offender.  This sentence was set aside on the basis that those circumstances were not properly characterised as ""exceptional"" (at 516 and 517 per Gleeson CJ).  The sentencing judge was found to have ""deflect[ed] her[self] from imposing the sentence of full-time imprisonment which she plainly indicated she would otherwise have imposed"" (at 518).  Thus Edwards was a case in which the sentencing judge was found to have wrongly treated the impact on a third party as determinative of the type of sentence that was to be imposed.
116Although the limitations on considering hardship to third parties derived from Edwards are said to be the subject of ""well settled principles""  (FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [309] per R.A. Hulme J) they are sometimes stated in different terms.  Thus, in Hay v R [2013] NSWCCA 22 at [49] Edwards was cited for the proposition that ""[i]t is well established that the effect on family or others can be taken into account only in exceptional circumstances"".  That formulation reflects the statement of Wells J in Wirth (see also Waugh (aka Willoughby) v R [2010] NSWCCA 3 at [16] per Hidden J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing).  Recently, in R v MacLeod [2013] NSWCCA 108 at [43] the principle derived from Edwards was described as being that ""it is only in exceptional circumstances that hardship to third parties can be taken into account in order to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence"". This formulation leaves open the possibility that the ""otherwise appropriate sentence"" is one in which hardship to third parties falling short of exceptional circumstances is considered as part of the process of ""instinctive synthesis"", even if it cannot be considered as a ""distinct matter justifying any substantial modification of an otherwise appropriate penalty"" (Dipangkear v R [2010] NSWCCA 156 at [41] per Whealy J).
117This latter possibility has been explicitly recognised in cases discussing Edwards and applying the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""Sentencing Act"").  Thus, for example, in R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 at [21] Hodgson JA, with whom Levine and Howie JJ agreed, stated:
""In relation to the children, in my opinion this was not shown to be a case falling within the category of exceptional circumstances as discussed in Edwards. It is certainly a matter of concern, and a matter that can be taken into account as one subjective circumstance in assessing the appropriate penalty, that innocent children will be adversely affected by the imprisonment of their parents. However, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, this is not to be taken into account as a specific and particular matter resulting in a substantial reduction or elimination of a sentence of imprisonment.""  (emphasis added)
118It is unnecessary to consider these cases further as they concern the Sentencing Act, whereas this case involves the proper construction of the Crimes Act.  One matter of significance to the Sentencing Act is that hardship to an offender's family can justify a finding of ""special circumstances"" for the purposes of s 44(2) (King v R [2010] NSWCCA 202 at [18]; R v Grbin [2004] NSWCCA 220; R v Murphy [2005] NSWCCA 182).
Sub-section 16A(2)(p)
119The unchallenged finding made by her Honour extracted at [107] reflects the literal terms of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act, which relevantly provides:
""(1)  In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.
(2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:
(a)   the nature and circumstances of the offence;
...
(p)   the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants.""
120On its face this provision clearly enables sentencing judges to take into account the probable hardship to an offender's family of the offender's incarceration. 
121It has been accepted that s 16A of the Crimes Act is apt to incorporate some judge-made sentencing principles. Thus, in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [25] the plurality stated:
""As noted in Johnson v R, s 16A of the Crimes Act, on its proper construction, accommodates the application of common law principles of sentencing, such as the principle of ""totality"" discussed in Mill v R.  Section 16A accommodates the application of that and some other judicially developed general sentencing principles because those principles give relevant content to the statutory expression 'of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence' used in s 16A(1), as well as some of the expressions used in s 16A(2), such as 'the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence'.""  (references omitted)
122However the accommodation by s 16A of judge-made sentencing principles has its limits (Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1; 244 CLR 638 at [18] and [25]).  It is not apposite to s 16A(2)(p).  Unlike the provisions described in the above passage from Hili (ie s 16A(1) and 16A(2)(k)), s 16A(2)(p) is not drafted at a level of generality that permits the accommodation of the principle in Wirth.
123A consideration of the secondary materials does not lead to any conclusion different to that which is suggested by the plain words of the s 16A(2)(p) (Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 15AB(1)(a)).  Section 16A was introduced into the Crimes Act by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1989 (Cth), which started its life as the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1989. The Bill was the outcome of Australian Law Reform Commission's report on sentencing (ALRC Report 44: Sentencing, (March 1988)).  Chapter 6, entitled  ""Determining the sentence"", recommended at [170] the inclusion in legislation of a list of factors relevant to sentencing which comprehended ""the impact on third parties of a particular sanction, for example, distress, reduced financial circumstances and deprivation of emotional support for the offender's family"".  In explaining this recommendation the Report stated at [172]:
""Two controversial matters. Two matters have been included which may be regarded as controversial.
·  Impact of a particular sanction on third parties. This matter might be thought to authorise punishment otherwise than by reference to the offender's characteristics or conduct and therefore not be consistent with the principles underlying this report. On the other hand, depending upon the nature of the relationship, a detrimental impact on the offender's family can itself be a form of punishment of the offender. Several submissions to the Commission warned of the potentially destructive results if the impact of punishment on third parties, especially the family of the offender, was ignored.""
124Of greater significance is the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill which stated as follows in relation to s 16A:
""Subsection (1) directs a sentencing court to impose a sentence or make an order that is appropriate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the circumstances of the offence.
Subsection (2) contains a number of matters that must be taken into account by a court when selecting a sentence, if relevant. These matters are in addition to matters a court is otherwise required or permitted to take into account on sentencing. The subsection in part gives statutory recognition to matters already taken into account by courts when sentencing (eg the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person), but it also highlights certain matters including the circumstances of the victim and the probable effect of the sentence on the offender's family or dependants. The matters to be taken into account are not set out in a hierarchy of importance or significance.""  (emphasis added)
125This passage suggests that s 16A(2)(p) was seen as introducing a matter that had not previously been considered by the Courts.  In so far as the passage from the judgment of Wells J in Wirth suggests that a sentencing  court was precluded from giving any consideration to the hardship caused to family members unless that hardship was exceptional, then s 16A(2)(p) was intended to alter that position.
Cases considering s 16A(2)(p)
126In Adami and Adami v R (1989) 42 A Crim R 88 the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal construed s 10(n) of the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1988 (SA) as not altering the common law position that ""the effect of a sentence of imprisonment on dependants is not normally to be taken into account in fixing the sentence"" (at 91 per Bollen J).  Sub-section 10(n) was in similar terms to s 16A(2)(p).  In R v Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 at 430 to 431, the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal (Malcolm CJ, Kennedy and Pidgeon JJ agreeing) referred to Adami and Adami, and held that s16A of the Crimes Act was not intended to alter the common law, finding that the sentencing judge had wrongly construed s 16A(2)(p) as though it had.
127In R v Matthews (1996) 130 FLR 230 at 233 the Victorian Court of Appeal (Phillips CJ, Southwell and Hampel A-JJA agreeing) followed Sinclair to the effect that ""hardship to the family of the [offender] resulting from the [offender's] imprisonment could be taken into account only if that hardship were exceptional"", although it was acknowledged that at ""first sight"" that result was not supported by s 16A(2)(p).
128In his often quoted passage in R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; 127 A Crim R 23 at [13] to [17], Spigelman CJ followed these decisions stating:
""His Honour approached the sentencing exercise on the basis that hardship to a child had to be classified as 'exceptional' before it could be given substantial weight for the purposes of s16A(2)(p). Counsel for both the Appellant and the Respondent in this appeal accepted that his Honour was correct.
The necessity for such an 'exceptional' effect has long been accepted for sentencing at common law. (See eg R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 per Gleeson CJ at 516-517).
The South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal held that legislation in that State to the same effect as s16A(2)(p) did not affect the application of the common law principle (R v Adami (1989) 51 SASR 229). The Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal came to the same conclusion with respect to s16A(2)(p) (R v Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 esp at 430-431). This was also the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in Victoria (R v Matthews (1996) 130 FLR 230 at 233). (See also R v Carmody (1998) 100 A Crim R 41 at 45).
Courts of Criminal Appeal in three States have interpreted s16A(2)(p) as not altering the common law. Exceptional hardship is required. It is important that Courts of Criminal Appeal adopt the same approach to the interpretation of national legislation. Some comments by Dunford J appear to express a different view (R v Caradonna [2000] NSWCCA 398 at [25]). However Gleeson CJ referred to the South Australian and Western Australian decisions without disapproval in Edwards supra at 517. Subsequently to Caradonna, where he had agreed with Dunford J, Wood CJ at CL affirmed the authority of the earlier cases (R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73 at [36]).
If there is to be any change in this position, and that was not put in this case even on a formal basis, only the High Court can effect it.""  (emphasis added)
129The reference to ""substantial"" in the first paragraph of this extract suggests that Spigelman CJ may have left scope for hardship that was not classified as exceptional to be given some weight in the sentencing exercise.  The statement in the last paragraph presumably reflects his Honour's assessment of the weight of accumulated authority on the point.  Further, at [80] of Togias Grove J endorsed a passage from an academic text that referred to the need for the hardship to be ""overwhelming"" or ""extreme"" as ""correctly stating the law, applicable both at common law and by virtue of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act"".
130Shortly after Togias was decided, in R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286 at [31] Howie J stated:
""It is now clear that the reference in s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act to the 'probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependents' should be read as if it were proceeded by the words 'in an exceptional case': R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522 where many of the relevant cases concerned with the effect on a child of a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the mother are considered in the judgment of Grove J. But each case will, to a very great degree, depend upon its own facts involving an evaluation of the seriousness of the objective circumstances of the offence committed, the extent of the requirement for general and, perhaps, specific deterrence, and the nature and degree of the impact of the sentence upon the third person. It should be emphasised that the question of whether the probable effect of a sentence upon a third party will give rise to an exceptional case, cannot be considered in isolation from the facts of the particular matter and the degree of criminality involved in the offences for which sentence is to be imposed.""  (emphasis added)
131The reference in this paragraph to ""the nature and degree of the impact of the sentence upon the third person"" is to be understood as explaining the manner of assessing whether the relevant hardship is truly exceptional. The opening part of the paragraph makes explicit that s16A(2)(p) is to be read consistent with the passage from the judgment of Wells J in Wirth. It precludes any consideration being given to such hardship unless it satisfies the description of exceptional.
132In R v Nguyen James J, with whom Hidden and Hislop JJ agreed, arguably formulated a different approach at least to that stated by Howie J in Hinton.  His Honour noted at [21] to [22] the discussion in Togias and Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136, but then also noted the passage from the judgment of Hodgson JA in Girard extracted above at [117].  His Honour then reconciled those decisions as follows at [27]]:
""It was submitted by the Crown that, accepting that X and Girard had been correctly decided and should be applied in the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders, all that those cases had decided was that hardship to members of an offender's family, while it could be taken into account as a part of the general subjective facts, could not be used to justify any substantial reduction in sentence, unless it was truly exceptional. In my opinion, this submission is in accordance with the parts of Sully J's judgment in X and Hodgson JA's judgment in Girard which I have quoted and should be accepted.""  (emphasis added)
133Since they were decided, Togias and Hinton have been applied by this Court in numerous judgments concerning federal offenders (eg Sowaid v R [2011] NSWCCA 177 at [39],  R v Aller [2004] NSWCCA 378 at [23],  Le at [25],  Van Eeden v R [2012] NSWCCA 18 at [3] and at [36] to [39,  Hawkins at [55]),  Ihemeje v R [2012] NSWCCA 269 at [71],  McCraw v R [2011] NSWCCA 162 at [11],  Kertebani at [66],  Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22; 193 A Crim R 87 at [68] to [70]).  Only in Le was the correctness of Togias and Hinton directly challenged as it was in this case, and in that case it does not appear that the Court was taken to the secondary materials.
Interstate decisions since Togias and Hinton
134Mr Game SC submitted that the broad consensus that appeared to have been reached by the intermediate Courts of Appeal concerning s 16A(2)(p) as revealed by the passage from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Togias had unravelled since those judgments were published. He accepted that Queensland (R v Huston; ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] QCA 350; 219 A Crim R 209) and Victoria (Markovic v R;  Pantelic v R [2010] VSCA 105; 200 A Crim R 510) had maintained the test of exceptional circumstances or exceptional hardship.  However he submitted that the Australian Capital Territory had accepted his primary submission and that the position was now different in Western Australia and South Australia to what it had formerly been.
135I accept Mr Game's submission in so far as it concerns the Australian Capital Territory.  In Director of Public Prosecutions v Ip [2005] ACTCA 24 at [60]  the Full Court of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory (Higgins CJ, Gray and Madgwick JJ) ""specifically dissociate[d] itself from the reasoning"" in Togias.
136However I do not accept the balance of Mr Game SC's submission.  He contended that in R v Berlinsky [2005] SASC 316 the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal adopted a different approach to s 16A(2)(p) to that which they adopted to the equivalent provision in State law considered in Adami and Adami.  However, in Berlinsky at [5] Doyle CJ referred to and applied Adami and Adami and referred to the need to establish exceptional circumstances.  Gray J, at [15] to [17], referred with approval to a number of judgments of other intermediate Courts of Appeal that required  exceptional circumstances or hardship.
137As for Western Australia, Mr Game SC referred the Court to the twin decisions of Nguyen v R [2001] WASCA 72; 118 A Crim R 519, and Nguyen v R [2001] WASCA 119;  160 FLR 284.  However, in allowing the appeal and ordering a non-custodial sentence in that case, the Court clearly applied a test that required exceptional circumstances to be demonstrated (Nguyen v R [2001] WASCA 119 at [39] per Malcolm CJ and at [66] per Wallwork J).  Further, in S v R [2003] WASCA 309 at [29] Miller J, with whom McKechnie J agreed, restated the need for exceptional circumstances in cases which seek to invoked s 16A(2)(p).  Wallwork AJ disagreed, stating at [39] that s 16A(2)(p) ""should be applied in State Courts without any 'riders' to the clear words of the section"".
138Tasmania is too often overlooked.  However, it does not appear that this issue has been dealt with by its Court of Criminal Appeal, although Sinclair, Matthews and Togias have been followed at first instance (McAree v Barr [2006] TASSC 37 at [21] per Evans J).
Approach to s 16A(2)(p)
139The above represents only a sample of the judgments of intermediate courts of appeal that have considered or applied s 16A(2)(p). Contrary to Mr Game SC's submission, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory, intermediate Courts of Appeal of all the mainland States have consistently construed it in a manner that requires that exceptional circumstances be demonstrated before its subject matter is to be given any, or possibly any substantial, weight.  Nevertheless, the origin of that principle is a South Australian decision concerning legislation of that state. As best as I can ascertain, none of the judgments that have adopted or applied this principle has attempted to reconcile it with the express words of the section or considered the secondary materials concerning its introduction. In my view those matters invalidate the assumption upon which this stream of cases has flowed, namely that the section was not intended to modify the common law's treatment of hardship to an offender's family. 
140This succession of cases has led to the adoption of a principle with little to commend it.  If in other contexts Courts are bound to consider the impact of their orders on innocent third parties (Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30; 195 CLR 1 at [65] to [66]; Silktone Pty Ltd v Devreal Capital Pty Ltd (1990) 21 NSWLR 317 at 324 and 332), why is the impact on children of any sentence under consideration to be excluded unless their hardship is only exceptional? The primary objects in sentencing of ""retribution, deterrence [and the] protection of society"" described by Wells J in Wirth can still be given effect to without requiring sentencing courts to divide the forms of hardship occasioned to an offender's family into those which meet the description ""exceptional"" and those which do not.  The assessment of probable hardship to family members is a task that sentencing courts are perfectly able to undertake, and no doubt they do.  In any event, the words of the section and the secondary materials indicate a clear policy choice on the part of the legislature on this topic.
141Further, the difficulty that accompanies the addition of a gloss to a legislative provision that is otherwise clear is revealed by the different formulations of the gloss that have emerged from the cases.  The construction adopted by Howie J in Hinton suggests that no consideration can be given to hardship that falls short of the description ""exceptional"".  The judgment of  Spigelman CJ in Togias suggests that something other than ""substantial weight"" might be afforded to probable hardship occasioned to family members of offenders even if exceptional circumstances cannot be demonstrated.   Nguyen appears to confirm that.  In circumstances where s 16A(2) specifies that a court is to take a ""matter into account"", what authority does an intermediate court of appeal have to specify the weight a sentencing court attaches to that factor?  The relevant constraint on a sentencing court affording too much weight to the factor set out in s 16A(2)(p) is to be found in s 16A(1).  Unconstrained by authority, in my view, s 16A(2)(p) should be applied by sentencing courts according to its terms, without having to determine whether the circumstances are exceptional or otherwise. If the result of affording weight to that consideration is that the sentence is unduly lenient then that will attract appellate interference on the established basis that it is manifestly inadequate, but not because some specified level of weight was attached to this factor that the Crimes Act does not expressly preclude.  A  sentence that is manifestly inadequate does not conform with s 16A(1).
142Standing in the path of the adoption of this approach is the stream of authority in this Court and other intermediate courts of appeal that I have referred to.  In so far as the latter is concerned, I can only depart from their interpretation of a Commonwealth law if I am ""convinced that that interpretation is plainly wrong"" (Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 at 492;  Hili at [57]).  The same test has been said to apply to departures from earlier decisions of this Court  (Hili at [74] per Heydon J).
143In Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504 at [294] to [295] the Court of Appeal (Allsop P, Beazley and Basten JJA) described this test as stating a necessary but not sufficient basis for departure, and expanded upon what was meant by the description ""plainly wrong"":
""The phrases 'plainly wrong' or 'clearly wrong' can be understood to focus on at least one or more of the following attributes of a ruling: 
    (a)    the fact of error is immediately (in the sense mentioned in [283] above) apparent from reading the relevant judgment;
    (b)   the strong conviction of the later court that the earlier judgment was erroneous and not merely the choice of an approach which was open, but no longer preferred (cf Chamberlain and Clutha), and
(c) the nature of the error that can be demonstrated with a degree of clarity by the application of correct legal analysis.
In our view, the first possibility is liable to be highly subjective and should not be required, where the other two possibilities are satisfied. The existence of (b) and (c) is a precondition to the exercise of the power to depart from earlier authority.""
144In my view, the words of s 16A(2)(p) are clear.  The secondary materials confirm that meaning.  The cases that have considered the provision have not reconciled their construction with either.  I am satisfied that the construction of s 16A(2)(p) which reads the provision as though it was preceded or proceeded by the words ""in an exceptional case"" is plainly wrong on either of the approaches suggested in Gett at [294] to [295]. 
145In Gett at [296] to [301] the Court of Appeal also noted that there were ""practical considerations"" which governed a decision to depart from earlier authority even if the precondition to departure had been established. At [297] their Honours noted a passage from John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1989] HCA 5; 166 CLR 417 at 438 to 439, namely:
""There is no doubt that this court has power to review and depart from its previous decisions. However, such a course is not lightly undertaken: see Queensland v Commonwealth (1977) 16 ALR 487; 139 CLR 585, especially at 599, 602 and 620. Although there is, in the words of Dixon J in Attorney-General (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co (Ltd) (1952) 85 CLR 237 at 243-4, 'no very definite rule as to the circumstances in which [the court] will reconsider an earlier decision', in Commonwealth v Hospital Contribution Fund (1982) 40 ALR 673 ; 150 CLR 49 Gibbs CJ (at 56-8), with whom Stephen J (at 59) and Aickin J (at 66) agreed, specified four matters which in that case justified departure from earlier decisions. The first was that the earlier decisions did not rest upon a principle carefully worked out in a significant succession of cases. The second was a difference between the reasons of the justices constituting the majority in one of the earlier decisions. The third was that the earlier decisions had achieved no useful result but on the contrary had led to considerable inconvenience. The fourth was that the earlier decisions had not been independently acted on in a manner which militated against reconsideration, as had been the case in Queensland v Commonwealth.""
146The Court of Appeal in Gett accepted that the principles governing the departure by the High Court from its earlier decisions did not necessarily translate to intermediate courts of appeal (at [299]).  In particular, account must be taken of the role of the High Court in resolving differences that may emerge either between intermediate courts of appeal or within them (at [299]).  Nevertheless the Court noted the need for consistency and certainty in the law (at [300]).
147In this case the Director was plainly on notice that the correctness of Togias and Hinton was challenged.  The Director responded by pointing to the consistent line of authority that was contrary to the respondent's contention. However the Director did not contend that any great uncertainty or inconvenience would be occasioned by a departure from those decisions. 
148One of the considerations identified in John as potentially warranting a departure from earlier decisions is that the ""earlier decisions did not rest upon a principle carefully worked out in a significant succession of cases"". There is no doubt that the principle referred to in Edwards is a principle that ""was carefully worked out in a significant succession of cases"". However, as I have sought to demonstrate, the adopted construction of s16A(2)(p) is not such a principle.
149Notwithstanding the authorities to the contrary, I accept Mr Game SC's first submission as noted in [111] above.
The respondent's family
150At the time of the hearing of the appeal the respondent's son was nine years old and his daughter was seven.  In her affidavit, the respondent's wife described the offender as a ""hands on"" father.  The affidavit evidence confirms that the family was close.
151The passage from the judgment of Simpson J refers to the ""worrying behavioural tendencies"" of the respondent's son.  This was not a reference to any form of anti-social behaviour on his part, but instead to him manifesting significant anxiety about the fate of his father and thus his family.  The context is that he and his sister have never known a time when their parents were not under severe stress as a result of the respondent's investigation and trial.  It is unnecessary to describe how the son's anxiety manifests itself.  However, by way of example, it appears that, unbeknown to his parents, he had written to the Australian Tax Office asking them to drop the action against his father.  He believes that his intervention caused his father to avoid incarceration.  Not surprisingly, in her affidavit his mother describes her fears for her son's wellbeing if his father is incarcerated.
152In the passage extracted from her Honour's judgment in [107] above, the ""irremediable ... effects"" on the respondent's wife and children of his incarceration were not identified, nor did they need to be. In the circumstances the likely harm to the wellbeing of his family, especially his children, is obvious.  In this case, the unchallenged finding of her Honour, which is confirmed by the material before the Court, is a matter deserving of real weight in the process of synthesising the various factors relevant to fixing an appropriate sentence.  
153Having regard to that and to other matters I have referred to, I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

2762519,Isbester v R [2013] NSWCCA 230,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:OffenceThe appellant was charged with the following offence:Between about 19 February 2006 and about 10 April 2010 at Sydney did deal with money or other property, the proceeds of crime, and was reckless as to the fact that the money or property was proceeds of crime, and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or property was $100,000 or more, contrary to s400.4(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).
2The trial proceeded before Tupman DCJ and a jury for 21 days between 16 June and 24 July 2012.  On 24 July 2012 the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
3The appellant relies upon two grounds of appeal:
Ground of Appeal 1:  The verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported.
Ground of Appeal 2:  The jury were not properly directed regarding the elements of the offence charged.
Factual Background
4The prosecution case was as follows.  Eva and Phillip Southcombe were directors and shareholders in the company, Gladesville Bridge Marina Pty Limited (GBM).  In 1998 they arranged for the company to send funds overseas in a tax evasion scheme set up by Robert Agius, an accountant based in Vanuatu.  The funds were disguised as payment for services and interest on non-existent loans, and were intended to be returned to the Southcombes (thereby evading the payment of tax on dividends paid by the company to them as shareholders).  
5The scheme continued for some years.  Between 25 May 2005 and 9 April 2008 the appellant delivered large amounts of cash to the Southcombes.  All of it was made up of funds sent overseas as part of the tax evasion scheme by GBM.  All of that cash was, under Australian tax law, deemed dividends paid to the Southcombes and thus part of their taxable income.
6On 6 April 2006, pursuant to tax returns lodged on 30 March 2006, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) issued a Notice of Assessment in relation to the Southcombes for the 2005 financial year which did not include in their taxable income the dividends notionally received in 2005.  At that point in time, the amount of tax thereby evaded became proceeds of crime, either on the basis that it was proceeds of the conspiracy between Agius and the Southcombes to evade tax, or on the basis that it was proceeds of crime committed by the Southcombes of obtaining a financial advantage by deception.
7Amended Notices of Assessment were subsequently issued by the ATO in respect of the Southcombes for the year 2005.  Evidence was adduced that each had understated their taxable income by $500,598 with the consequence that each had evaded tax of $242,790.03.  It was the Crown case that more than $100,000 of the cash that the appellant delivered to the Southcombes after 6 April 2006 and before 10 April 2008 was accordingly proceeds of crime and that the appellant was at least reckless to that fact (in the sense that he was aware that there was a substantial risk that those funds were proceeds of crime).
8It was no part of the Crown case that the appellant had himself joined the conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth by tax evasion.  It was not suggested that he had engaged in any fraudulent activity.  It was not suggested that he had dealt with the property as an instrument of crime.
9The case against the appellant was that, because he acted as a courier for funds that were the subject of a tax evasion scheme, and was reckless as to that fact, he was guilty of the offence of recklessly dealing in the ""proceeds of crime"".  On the prosecution case, the appellant dealt with at least $210,527 of deemed dividends in respect of which at least $100,000 in tax revenue had been evaded (assuming a tax rate of 48.5 percent).
10The following matters were important parts of the Crown case:
(a) The payments to the Southcombes were made outside the normal banking system by way of cash payments.
(b) In the earlier part of the period, the amount of cash delivered ranged between $10,000 and $30,000 each delivery.  In the later part of this period, the amounts decreased but remained over $1,000 for each delivery.
(c) These cash deliveries often occurred at covert locations, such as in parks or on the street.
(d) The appellant used code when discussing these deliveries in emails and on the phone with Mr Agius.
11The importance of the date 6 April 2006 is that this was the date on which the Notice of Assessment was issued to the Southcombes by the ATO.
12By way of further background, the Southcombes since the early 1980's had operated a marina business called ""Gladesville Bridge Marina"".  They incorporated a company, GBM, in which they were the only directors and shareholders.  The Southcombes and GBM used as their accountants a firm, Owen T Daniel and Company.  It was Mr Daniel who persuaded them to enter the tax evasion scheme and who put them in contact with Mr Agius.
13The mechanics of the scheme were that GBM sent money to a bank account in New Zealand on the pretext that it was paying legitimate business expenses.  There were invoices to GBM from a company called ""Bilbury Ltd"".  The work that was being invoiced was never actually done.  GBM claimed these expenses as business expenses in order to reduce its tax liability.  The invoices were for amounts in the tens of thousands of dollars and they accumulated over a substantial period of time.
14After the payments were received into the Bilbury bank account, the money was then redirected to another New Zealand bank account in the name of ""Uniton Ltd"".  That money would be transferred back into the account of the GBM on the pretext that it was money that was being made available to GBM as a loan.  There was no legitimate loan.  This was the GBM money being returned to it.
15By the early 2000's GBM's balance sheet was showing that it had a debt by way of this loan of over $900,000.  The Southcombes were concerned because on the books of GBM the debt would just continue to grow and there was no way of them legitimately getting access to the money.  The Southcombes wanted to achieve a mechanism whereby the loan balance would not increase, but they would still be able to get their money out of the tax evasion scheme.
16The method used was as follows.  The GBM debt was transferred from Uniton to Security Life Nominees Ltd (SLN), another company controlled by Mr Agius that had a bank account in New Zealand.  GBM then commenced making payments to SLN which appeared on the documents to be repayments of the loan.  Initially, it was Mr Agius who then delivered cash directly to the Southcombes with it being shown through documents that he was purchasing a half share in a boat.  The documents showed that he provided a personal cheque to the value of $290,000.  Mr Agius never actually took any share in any boat.
17By early 2005 there was still a debt recorded that GBM owed SLN about a million dollars.  The Southcombes were told that the only way they could get access to that money would be if GBM transferred to SLN a million dollars so that the documentation would show that the loan had been repaid.  This is what the Southcombes did between 23 March 2005 and 16 June 2005.  During that period, GBM paid $1,000,001.00 to SLN.
18When the Southcombes caused GBM to send that money to SLN it was their intention that they would always get it back.  Accordingly, it was the Crown case that those payments which added up to just over a million dollars, were in fact a dividend paid by GBM to each of the Southcombes in half shares, i.e. approximately $500,000 to each of them.  As such, the Southcombes should have included those dividends in their tax returns for the tax year ending 30 June 2005.  In not doing so the Crown case was that they acted dishonestly and therefore committed a crime.
19In about May 2005 the appellant was introduced to the Southcombes by Mr Agius.  He was not a person whom they had previously met.  The introduction was done in a park in Drummoyne, near to where the Southcombes were living.  He was introduced as a person who at the time was running a catering business called ""Fit for a King"".  It was the Crown case that he was introduced by Mr Agius because it was to be his role to receive approximately one million dollars into his business bank accounts and for him to then take cash from those business accounts and to deliver that money to the Southcombes.
20It was the Crown case that the appellant commenced doing so in May 2005 and thereafter made payments to the Southcombes ranging between $10,000 to $30,000 every four weeks or so.
21The deliveries of cash initially occurred in a car-park near the Southcombes' house in Drummoyne.  After the Southcombes moved to a new house in Hunters Hill, some deliveries took place there.  The Southcombes would provide an authority to SLN, by sending emails to Mr Agius for money to be transferred to one of the appellant's business accounts.  
22On 24 October 2006 the Australian Federal Police executed search warrants at the accountancy firm of Owen T Daniel.  From that date, the appellant and one of the Southcombes would meet at the Hunters Hill Hotel or in a street outside the front of the hotel.  The code used was a simple one with the appellant in telephone intercepts referring to units of $1,000 as ""anchors"".
23The defence case was as follows.  There was no dispute that between 25 May 2005 and 9 April 2008 the appellant delivered large amounts of cash to the Southcombes.  It was disputed that any of those funds were proceeds of crime (or, at least, more than $100,000 of proceeds dealt with in the period specified in the indictment).  If they were the proceeds of crime, the appellant disputed that he was aware of a substantial risk that they were proceeds of crime.  The appellant said that the payments of cash were to repay a loan.  He said that he used code because he did not want it known that he was carrying large amounts of cash.
24In an application for a verdict by direction, the appellant submitted that it had not been proved that the cash which he delivered to the Southcombes was proceeds of crime because a tax liability was a pecuniary liability to the Commonwealth arising under taxation law - it was an unsecured debt (a chose in action) which the Commissioner had against the tax payer.  The appellant submitted that, properly analysed, any offence committed by the Southcombes resulted in the ATO being deprived of that chose in action, but he never dealt with that chose in action.  He dealt with the money which was the basis of the calculation of the amount of the debt.  The appellant submitted that nothing was ""realised"" by the Southcombes as a result of the failure to declare the dividends, rather there was a ""temporary reduction in the chose in action that the Commissioner had against the taxpayer"".  That application was rejected by the trial judge.
25Before the jury the appellant submitted that it had not been proved that he was reckless about the cash which he delivered to the Southcombes being proceeds of crime because of his evidence that he believed that the funds he had received, and subsequently delivered to the Southcombes as cash, were provided to him as a loan rather than as part of a scheme to evade tax.  He submitted that the Southcombes were paid back in cash because they wanted cash for their house renovations.  The appellant submitted that he had relied upon a legal opinion prepared in March 2000 which influenced his understanding of the legal position in relation to the money.  In evidence he said that he did not suspect that the funds were ""proceeds of crime"".  He said ""At worst, there was some tax minimisation which was not a crime"".  
26The appellant submitted that it had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt that he had turned his mind to the circumstances which actually rendered the cash he delivered proceeds of crime (in particular the circumstances that made the funds deemed dividends).
27The Southcombes in their evidence both denied that they had asked the appellant to make payments in cash so that they could pay for renovations to their house.
THE APPEALGround of Appeal 1:  The verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported.
28Section 400.4(2) of the Criminal Code Act relevantly provides:
""400(2)  A person is guilty of an offence if:
  (a)  the person deals with money or other property; and
   (b)   ...
(i)  the money or property is proceeds of crime ... 
and 
(c)   the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime ...; and

(d)   at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.""
29Section 400.1 defines ""proceeds of crime"":
""Proceeds of crime means any money or other property that is wholly or partly derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).""
30The appellant explained this Ground of Appeal.  He said that it raised the same issue as that set out in [24] hereof, which was the basis of the application for a verdict by direction before the trial judge.  For the reasons therein set out, the appellant submitted that his dealing with a sum of money which was the basis of the calculation of the amount of a debt owed by the Southcombes to the Commonwealth, could never amount to dealing with money which was the ""proceeds of crime"" as required by s400.4(2).  It was on that basis that he submitted that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and could not be supported.
31The appellant submitted that the Crown case was based on a wrong characterisation of the money sent by GBM to SLN.  The appellant noted that those funds had been derived or realised from the legitimate business activities of GBM.  He noted that it was necessary for the prosecution to rely upon s109C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the deeming of dividends.  That provision had the effect of including the deemed dividends in taxable income and determined the amount of tax that was ""evaded"" (more precisely, which had the effect of imposing a tax liability on the Southcombes in respect of the funds sent overseas by them).  As a result, the appellant accepted that it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the ATO was misled regarding the taxable income of the Southcombes when it issued a Notice of Assessment in relation to them which did not include the deemed dividends.  He accepted that as a result, the Southcombes (for a period of time at least) evaded liability for tax on that money.  The appellant submitted that such a circumstance was quite different from establishing that the cash which he delivered to the Southcombes was the proceeds of crime.  This was because what had occurred was not the commission of an offence by the Southcombes but the creation of a pecuniary liability in the Southcombes to the Commonwealth.
32In oral submissions the appellant put the argument as follows:
""The argument put by the defence at trial and put here is that none of the cash was proceeds of crime because the cash was the income by reference to which the tax was calculated.  None of it was the unpaid tax, nor was it derived from the unpaid tax.  ..."" (AT 3.21)
""What we are saying is that there is no provision in the tax legislation deeming a percentage of the income on which tax has not been paid as property of the Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth has legislation which says ""when you don't pay tax we can claim it back as a debt owed to the Tax Office"".  It should say the income or a percentage of the income in respect of which tax has not been paid is deemed to be property of the Commonwealth.  In substance that's what this prosecution really contends, that when you haven't paid X dollars in tax and you owe X dollars to the Commonwealth ""we're going to deem 48.5 percent of the income on which tax is calculated as the unpaid tax or as derived from the unpaid tax.""  (AT 4.25)
""... unpaid tax can be characterised as a benefit.  We are prepared to concede that.  We accept unpaid tax can be characterised as an advantage.  It is the next step of saying you go from that perhaps to another proposition saying any particular item of property is unpaid tax or is derived from unpaid tax.  That's the step which occurs in this case which was to be considered in Saffron or Jeffery.  It says nothing as to whether you can simply say that some income on which tax is calculated becomes the unpaid tax or is regarded as derived indirectly from unpaid tax.""  (AT 6.12)
33In support of that proposition, the appellant relied upon clause 255-1 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to the effect that ""a tax related liability is a pecuniary liability to the Commonwealth arising directly under a taxation law"".  By reference to other sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 the appellant concluded:
""Under clause 255-5(1) of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ""an amount of a tax related liability that is due and payable:
(a) Is a debt due to the Commonwealth ...""
And under clause 255-5(2), the Commissioner:
""May sue in his or her official name in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover an amount of a ""tax related liability that remains unpaid after it has become due and payable"".
34By that reasoning, the appellant submitted that it was not clear how any part of the cash delivered by him was ""derived or realised"" by the commission of the offence.  The Southcombes were lawfully entitled to all the money they received from him.  They had, for a time, evaded a liability for tax on that money and the ATO was deprived of the tax worked out ""by reference to"" that money, but none of the money dealt with by him was ""derived or realised"" by the commission of the offence - it was no more than the ""taxable income"" on the basis of which the ""tax payable"" was calculated.  In the alternative, the appellant submitted that money is not derived or realised by an offence that has the consequence that a liability to pay tax on that money is evaded.
35The appellant submitted that if the Crown's submission that he was dealing with the ""proceeds of crime"" were upheld, any person who dealt with money upon which he or she had failed to pay the correct amount of tax, was also guilty of the offence of which he was convicted.  The appellant submitted that this was an outcome which suggested that the definition of ""proceeds of crime"" should not be given such a broad interpretation as to extend to the money delivered to the Southcombes by him.
36There are a number of difficulties with this submission.  Implicit in it is the premise that because a sequence of events creates a tax liability (which is a pecuniary liability to the Commonwealth) in a person or entity, those same circumstances cannot also create an offence.  That is novel, controversial and is not self-evidently correct.  Just because tax legislation provides a mechanism for the recovery of evaded tax does not mean that evaded tax cannot also be the subject of a criminal offence.  
37The submission also adopts a somewhat benign interpretation of the facts.  The evidence showed that the amount owing in financial statements of GBM as a loan from SLN, was in reality the end product of many years of participation in a tax avoidance scheme by the Southcombes as shareholders of GBM.  GBM was paying funds to overseas companies for the payment of invoices to it for services which had not been provided.  Those funds were moved about so that they ultimately returned to GBM from SLN ostensibly as a loan.  
38The evidence was overwhelmingly to the effect that it was never the intention of GBM (nor of the Southcombes as its shareholders) to repay the SLN loan.  They intended and expected that in due course the loan would be forgiven.  That was an integral part of the scheme with which they and GBM were involved.  When that did not happen, the Southcombes determined that there was no other way to deal with the loan which in GBM's financial records was owed by it to SLN than to appear to repay the loan (as they did with the payments in 2005) but at all times with the expectation and with an arrangement in place with Mr Agius, that all of the funds used to repay the loan would be repaid to them.   The appellant was the person who delivered the cash by way of repayment to the Southcombes.  This involved very large amounts of money being paid into companies controlled by the appellant to enable him to perform this function.
39The effect of the appellant's submission is that no money would ever be directly or indirectly derived or realised by an offence if the transaction constituting the offence had the consequence that a liability to pay tax on that money is evaded.  It must follow, if that submission is correct, that as both of the offences particularised by the Crown were ""tax evasion"" offences, none of the money dealt with by him could ever be the proceeds of crime resulting from either of the offences.  Such a result would be surprising.
40The Crown approached this ground of appeal differently to the appellant.  It took as its start point the elements of the s400.4(2) offence with particular reference to the definition of ""proceeds of crime"" as set out in s 400.1 (see [28] - [29] hereof).  The Crown submitted that the words of s400.1 were ordinary words in the English language and that their meaning and application in this case were questions of fact for the jury.  The Crown submitted that each element in the definition of ""proceeds of crime"" had been made out and that there was nothing unreasonable in the jury's conclusion to that effect.  That being so, the offence by the appellant had been made out.
41By reference to the definition of ""proceeds of crime"", the two offences relied upon by the Crown were that of a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, contrary to s29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), i.e. that the Southcombes conspired with Mr Agius and others to defraud the Commonwealth of money by entering into a scheme whereby they would not be required to pay tax on funds paid out by GBM, which would otherwise be required to be declared as a dividend.  The other offence was one contrary to s134.2(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, namely obtaining a financial advantage by deception.  The basis for this offence was that dividends which ought to have been declared were avoided and as such the Southcombes did not declare those dividends in their 2005 tax returns thereby avoiding paying tax on those dividends.
42On the relatively uncontroversial facts, the Southcombes knew that their participation in the scheme was dishonest.  During the 2005 financial year GBM sent in excess of $1 million to SLN in purported repayment of a fictitious loan.  The Southcombes as sole directors and shareholders of GBM caused GBM to do this with the intention that the money would be repaid to them.  On 30 March 2006 when the Southcombes each lodged tax returns for the 2005 financial year, those returns did not include an amount of $500,598 (their individual shares of the amount sent by GBM to SLN) as income received from GBM.  They were required to do so because s109C provided that a private company is deemed to have paid a dividend to a person if it made a payment on behalf of that person.  After 6 April 2006 at least $470,000 was paid to the Southcombes in cash by the appellant.  
43It was against that factual background that the Crown case required the jury to find that the cash payments handed over by the appellant were derived from the commission of one of the offences relied upon.
44In that respect the appellant accepted that the meaning of ""derived"" in the context of tax evasion offences was correctly set out in Saffron v DPP [1989] 96 FLR 196 and DPP v Jeffery [1992] 58 A Crim R 310.  In Saffron, Clarke JA found that Saffron had derived a ""monetary benefit"" being the tax saved which flowed from his commission of a tax evasion offence.  Kirby P accepted as correct the conclusion that the profits from Saffron's unpaid taxes were a benefit ""indirectly"" derived from the commission of a tax evasion offence.  Hunt CJ at CL in Jeffery by reference to Saffron v DPP concluded that property acquired by the use of money made available to Jeffery by reason of him committing the offence of understating his income was indirectly derived from that offence.
45Another way of expressing the findings in Saffron v DPP is that Saffron directly derived the money he should have paid in tax because he retained it to use as he saw fit.  Similarly, his profits cannot have been indirectly derived from the commission of an offence unless the cash which represented the unpaid tax was directly derived from the same offending.  Inherent in the approach of Hunt CJ at CL in Jeffery was a finding that the money made available by the tax evasion offence was directly derived by the commission of that offence.  Accordingly, it is difficult to reconcile the point taken by the appellant with the effect of those decisions.
46The Crown submitted that by reference to the reasoning in Saffron and Jeffery it was clear that the definition of ""proceeds of crime"" had been satisfied in that the evaded tax had been derived indirectly by the Southcombes from the commission of one of the relevant offences.  It followed, the Crown submitted, that there was ample evidence before the jury to establish the first two elements of the s400.4(2) offence, i.e. the appellant had dealt with money and that the money was the proceeds of crime.
47The Crown rejected the appellant's submission (at [35] hereof).  It submitted that a person dealing with money on which the incorrect tax has been paid is not liable for criminal punishment unless the reason for the incorrect payment is the commission of a criminal offence.  Put another way, the Crown submitted that for a person to be liable for criminal punishment, there needed to be some predicate criminal offending.  Almost inevitably this would involve some degree of dishonesty on the part of the offender.  There would not be any predicate offending if the failure to pay the correct tax occurred due to mere inadvertence and without dishonesty.  In addition, the Crown submitted that the person dealing with the money had to have some awareness that the money being dealt with was the proceeds of crime.  If a person had such an awareness, then it was appropriate that they face criminal sanction for their conduct.
48In my opinion, the Crown submissions should be accepted.  They take as their start point the criminal offence.  They identify the elements of the criminal offence and set out by reference to the facts and authority how those elements have been satisfied.  They, in effect, highlight the incongruity which would result if the appellant's submission were accepted.    This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground of Appeal 2:  The jury were not properly directed regarding the elements of the offence charged.
49The appellant qualified this Ground of Appeal in oral submissions to the effect that he had abandoned any criticism of the directions as to recklessness (AT 1.19, 8.12).
50This ground of appeal is closely related to Ground of Appeal 1 in that the primary complaint of the appellant was that the direction given to the jury concerning the ""proceeds of crime"" did not raise the issue which formed the basis of Ground of Appeal 1.  The appellant accepted that the jury was told, correctly, that evaded tax was a loss to the Commonwealth and a financial advantage to the Southcombes.  His complaint, however, was that no directions were given regarding the question whether any of the cash delivered by him to the Southcombes ""resulted from, or was a product of"" that loss to the Commonwealth and financial advantage to the Southcombes.
51To illustrate the submission, the appellant relied upon the written direction at AB 1, p 45:
""(b) Were these cash payments in fact the proceeds of crime?
The jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cash payments handed over were derived from the commission of one or other of those two offences.  Derived means came from or resulted from or was a product of the commission of one or other of those two offences, either a conspiracy amongst the Southcombes and others to cause a loss to the Commonwealth or the Southcombes obtain a financial advantage from the Commonwealth by deception.
Question:  What is the loss to the Commonwealth or financial advantage claimed?
Answer:  The tax which ought to have been paid.""
52The appellant submitted that such a direction was of little assistance to the jury and that more guidance should have been provided to them.
53The appellant also relied on the further written direction at AB 1, p 50:
""Question:  What is the method of calculation?
Answer:  The tax rate payable on income in excess of $70,000 per annum at the relevant date was 48.5 percent.  The proceeds of crime amounts to 48.5 percent of payments which are found to have been made as the proceeds of crime by the accused to the Southcombes after 6 April 2006 about which he was reckless as to whether they were the proceeds of crime.
The total of payments found to have been made as proceeds of crime from 6 April 2006 must be at least $206,186 before this element could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.
Issue for jury consideration:
(1) Determine which payments made after 6 April 2006, if not all, were in fact made as proceeds of crime in relation to which the accused was reckless about that.
(2) Calculate the total of those payments.
(3) Calculate 48.5 percent of that total.
(4) If that final figure is less than $100,000 then the accused must be acquitted.  The figure must be at least $100,000 for this element to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.""
54The appellant submitted that these directions must have led to confusion in the jury's mind as to precisely what amounts were to be regarded as ""proceeds of crime"".  The appellant submitted that when referring to the ""proceeds of crime"" the trial judge appeared to confuse the total of the monies not declared by the Southcombes with the amount of the unpaid tax.
55The Crown submitted that the jury received appropriate directions to the effect that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the monies delivered by the appellant to the Southcombes were derived from one of the offences particularised by the prosecution.  The Crown submitted that the written direction at AB 1, p 45 was adequate in that what it made clear was that the decision on that issue was a question of fact for the jury.  The Crown submitted that the issue to be decided by the jury was clearly identified.
56The Crown noted that directions to similar effect were given in the summing up:
""So the next element you have to be satisfied about beyond reasonable doubt is that the money was the proceeds of crime.  What does proceeds of crime mean?  In this trial when I say relevantly - and the only reason I say that is because the definition is broader but the way in which the Crown brought the case I'm just giving you the definition that is relevant for the way in which the charge has been brought in this trial - relevantly in this trial, that means any money that is wholly or partly derived by any person from the commission of a relevant offence against the law of the Commonwealth.""  (SU 46.23 - 47.4)
""If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those offences was committed then you have to consider another issue before you could be satisfied that element 2 is made out, and that is that any money paid over by the accused to the Southcombes was in fact the proceeds of crime.
You have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cash payments handed over were derived from the commission of one or other of those two offences.
Derived also is a term that is not actually defined in the relevant legislation, but again it is an ordinary word, and it means that it resulted from, or was a product of, the commission of one or other of those two offences - either a conspiracy amongst the Southcombes and others to cause the Commonwealth a loss, or the offence of the Southcombes obtaining a financial advantage for themselves from the Commonwealth by deception.
The question you should ask is ""what is the loss to the Commonwealth or the financial advantage claimed?""  The answer to that is ""the tax which ought to have been paid"" because no matter which of the two offences you are looking at, that is the same answer to the question.""  (SU 54.6 - .23)
57In relation to the second matter raised by the appellant, the Crown accepted that there was an ambiguity in the written direction provided by the trial judge at AB 1, p 50 (see [53] hereof).  It submitted that the context made it clear, however, that the relevant calculation was 48.5 percent of the monies received by the Southcombes from the appellant.  This was stated three times in the direction.  Accordingly, the ambiguity in expression would have had no effect on the amount calculated by the jury.  The Crown also noted that no objection was made by the appellant to the direction at trial.
58In relation to the first matter raised by the appellant, its resolution is dependent upon the outcome of Ground 1 of the appeal which has not been made out.  In relation to the second, there is some ambiguity in the way in which the written direction at AB 1, p 50 has been expressed.  Despite that ambiguity, the mathematical process to be followed by the jury was clearly set out on three occasions.  The jury could have been in no doubt as to how they should calculate the figure for the ""proceeds of crime"" if they reached that point in their deliberations.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
59The orders which I propose are:
(1) Leave to appeal is granted.(2) The appeal is dismissed.
60LATHAM J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
61BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		15 October 2013",2013-10-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762542,Patsalis v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 343,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Basten JA in draft.
2I agree with his Honour for the reasons given by him that in considering the application of Mr Patsalis under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, R A Hulme J was not exercising judicial power, nor did the consideration of the application by him constitute judicial proceedings.
3It follows that I agree with Basten JA that the decision of R A Hulme J to decline to order an inquiry or to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal is susceptible to judicial review for jurisdictional error.
4I also agree with Basten JA for the reasons given by him that R A Hulme J made no error of law in rejecting the application.
5It follows that the orders proposed by Basten JA should be made.
6In the circumstances, I would prefer to defer consideration of the other matters raised by Basten JA until the need arises.
7BEAZLEY P:  I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA for the reasons his Honour gives in respect of those orders.  I also prefer to defer consideration of the other matters raised by Basten JA as they do not directly arise in this case.
8BASTEN JA:  On 24 September 1999 the applicant, Michael Patsalis, was convicted of murder.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 16 years with a balance of term of 5 years 6 months.  He and his co-accused, Alexios Spathis, each appealed against their convictions and sentences.  On 29 November 2001 each appeal was dismissed: R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476.  The applicant sought leave to appeal to the High Court, but that application was refused: Patsalis v The Queen [2007] HCA Trans 651.
9His rights of appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) were thus exhausted: Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; 60 CLR 431; International Finance Trust Co Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission [2009] HCA 49; 240 CLR 319 at [129].  Nevertheless, against the possibility that matters may subsequently come to light which cast doubt upon the fairness or correctness of a conviction, there has long been power to hold an inquiry where rights of appeal have been exhausted: see eg Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 475 (as enacted).  There has also long been a power in the Executive to confer a pardon which could, somewhat anomalously, be exercised where doubts arise with respect to a conviction or sentence: see eg Criminal Appeal Act, s 26.  These provisions have since been repealed and replaced by Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""Appeal and Review Act"").  In particular, s 78 of the Appeal and Review Act permits an application to be made to the Supreme Court by or on behalf of a convicted person, seeking an inquiry into the conviction or sentence.  A copy is to be provided to the relevant Minister: s 78(2).  The powers of the Supreme Court are found in s 79 which, so far as relevant, provides:
79 Consideration of applications
(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:
(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:
(a) it appears that the matter:
(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and
(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action....
(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.
(5) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).
10The pardoning power has been retained in s 76 of the Appeal and Review Act, which permits a petition for review of a conviction or sentence to be made to the Governor.  The Governor may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer, refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal or request the Court of Criminal Appeal to give an opinion on any particular point: s 77(1).  The Governor's power to take one of those steps is limited to a case where it appears ""that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt"": s 77(2).
11On 22 August 2011 the applicant submitted a petition to the Governor pursuant to s 76 of the Appeal and Review Act.  On 16 April 2012 the applicant was advised that his petition had been declined.  The same material, although supplemented from time to time during the course of the process, was lodged, whilst the petition to the Governor was pending, with an application under s 78 of the Appeal and Review Act.  That application was referred to R A Hulme J for inquiry, pursuant to s 79(1)(a).  On 20 November 2012 R A Hulme J determined that the application be refused, providing written reasons for that determination: Patsalis - Application for Inquiry into Conviction pursuant to section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001 [2012] NSWSC 1597.  
12Although the proceedings are described in s 79(4) as ""not judicial proceedings"", the decision in this case was entitled ""judgment"".  Whether that appellation was correct is a matter which will need to be addressed.  It may in part have been responsible for the view of the applicant that he was entitled to appeal from that decision.  On 10 December 2012 he filed a notice of intention to appeal to this Court.  A summons seeking leave to appeal was subsequently filed, leading to a motion by the Attorney General for New South Wales, seeking dismissal of the application on the ground that it was incompetent.  That motion was heard on 17 April 2013, when the Court granted the applicant leave to file an amended summons which invoked the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW): Patsalis v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 98.  Those steps were taken without prejudice to the right of the Attorney to submit that the appeal should be dismissed as incompetent and the summons dismissed generally as incompetent on the basis that the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court did not extend to a decision of a judge of the Court sitting alone, in the exercise of non-judicial power.  These are matters to which it will be necessary to return.
13It is convenient to note that the Attorney General gave notice of a constitutional matter, pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), identifying the following question:
""Whether in the light of the principles discussed in Kirk v Industrial Relations [Court (NSW)] (2010) 239 CLR 531, the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court extends to the review of a decision of a single judge of the Court in relation to an application made under section 78 of the [Appeal and Review Act] seeking action under section 79(2) of [that Act] on the basis of an alleged 'doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case'.""
14For the reasons given below, the proceeding should be dismissed on the basis that there is no right of appeal from the refusal of the application and that the matters relied upon by the applicant do not provide a basis for the exercise of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction, without finally determining the existence or scope of that jurisdiction.
Nature of inquiry15In order to identify the validity of the challenges by the applicant to the decision of the primary judge, it is necessary to consider the nature of the inquiry conducted by him.  Both parties relied upon discussion of this issue in the cases.  The significance of such discussion is, however, dependent upon an understanding of the legislative history: the relevance of an authority will be materially affected if the legislation were in a different form at the time it was decided.  Central to the ultimate conclusion in the present case must be the statement in the current legislation that ""[p]roceedings under [s 79] are not judicial proceedings"": s 79(4).
16The legislative history has been considered in numerous cases, including White v The King [1906] HCA 53; 4 CLR 152; Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 and Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority (NSW) [2006] NSWCA 172; 66 NSWLR 151.  A sufficient history is provided by Heydon J in Eastman at [64]-[71], in relation to the New South Wales provisions later adopted in the ACT.  
17Two points of significance arise from that history.  The first is that earlier forms of these provisions pre-dated the existence of criminal appeals.  Prior to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the only available means of ""appeal"" were by writ of error and reservation of a point of law: Eastman at [70], Heydon J, referring to the analysis of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen in A History of the Criminal Law of England (1883).  The first legislative provision in this State which sought to remedy the deficiency in procedure where a doubt or question was raised with respect to a conviction was s 383 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 (NSW), which later became s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  As explained by McHugh J in Eastman at [8]:
""Against that background, s 475 can be seen as intended to authorise the Executive government to inform itself of possible miscarriages of justice resulting from deficiencies in the evidence adduced at the trial.  The section left it to the Executive government to determine whether any actual or suspected miscarriages of justice had occurred.  It also left to the discretion of the Executive government what steps should be taken to remedy any actual or suspected miscarriage of justice.  The remedies were of course limited and confined to commuting death sentences, granting free and conditional pardons and releasing prisoners on licence.""
18Section 383 envisaged two separate procedures by which persons could be summoned and examined on oath before a justice of the peace, who was required to take down the evidence as a deposition.  That step could be taken either by direction of the Governor on behalf of the Executive government, or by a judge of the Supreme Court ""of his own motion"".  Where the depositions were transmitted to the judge, the judge was required to report to the Governor.  The Governor, either on the report of the judge or on his or her own consideration of the depositions, was then to take such steps as appeared to be just.
19In Varley, this Court was concerned with an appeal from an order made by Lusher J in the Common Law Division dismissing a summons seeking an inquiry under s 475 into the applicant's conviction.  The Court (Hope JA, with Samuels JA agreeing; Kirby P dissenting) held that the role of the Supreme Court under s 475, like that of the Governor, was administrative and not judicial.
20Since that judgment, the Crimes Act was amended to include a new Pt 13A, which, subject to some minor amendments, is reflected in Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act.  In particular, s 474E (s 79 of the current legislation) contained a sub-s (4) in the same terms as s 79(4), stating that ""[p]roceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings"".  Accordingly, there is no purpose in reviewing the analysis of this Court in Varley.  Nor are the facts of Varley any longer relevant: the question in that case was whether a person could bring proceedings by summons in the Supreme Court, or whether the Court was required to act on its own motion.  (The Court upheld the latter view, treating the summons as an invalid attempt to commence judicial proceedings.)  The Appeal and Review Act now provides that an ""application"" for an inquiry may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person: s 78(1).  
21Section 79 in effect permits the following steps to be taken in the Supreme Court, namely that the Court may:
(a)consider an application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence;(b)on its own motion, consider whether there should be an inquiry into a conviction or sentence;(c)after (a) or (b) -(i)direct that an inquiry be conducted, or(ii)refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal.
22There is a question as to the meaning of ""proceedings"" in s 79(4).  It is unlikely that it was intended to cover a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Referral of ""the whole case"" leads to the matter being dealt with ""as an appeal"" under the Criminal Appeal Act, which would involve a judicial proceeding.  However, by the time that stage would be reached, the proceedings would not be ""proceedings under"" s 79.  Whether an inquiry conducted by a judicial officer on direction of a Supreme Court judge would be a judicial proceeding is less clear.  Because the judicial officer would have no other source of authority, it may well be that the inquiry is a proceeding ""under"" s 79.  If that were so, then s 79(4) in its terms would characterize the inquiry as ""not judicial proceedings"".  On the other hand, the reference in s 79(4) to the Supreme Court considering written submissions by the Crown ""with respect to an application"", suggests that the ""proceedings"" envisaged by that subsection may be limited to the consideration of an application for an inquiry or consideration of any matter which the Supreme Court seeks to address on its own motion.  The present case involves the consideration of an application for an inquiry which did not result in a direction that an inquiry be conducted.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to decide whether the inquiry would itself constitute a ""judicial proceeding""; it is sufficient to conclude that the consideration of the application was, pursuant to s 79(4), not a judicial proceeding.
23The Supreme Court Act provides for an appeal from ""any judgment or order of the Court in a Division"": s 101(1)(a).  Similar language is found in s 73 of the Constitution (""judgments, decrees, orders and sentences""), in the Judiciary Act (ss2 and 35) and many other statutes conferring appellate jurisdiction.  One point made in cases discussing these provisions is that a finding of fact or a ruling on a submission is not, of itself, an operative judicial act: The Commonwealth v Mullane [1961] HCA 28; 106 CLR 166 (Dixon CJ); Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCA 357; 75 NSWLR 392 (Spigelman CJ).  Another is that a reference to a ""judgment"" may mean an operative order as distinguished from reasons for judgment: Driclad Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1968] HCA 91; 121 CLR 45 at 64 (Barwick CJ and Kitto J).  Relevantly for present purposes, it has never been doubted that the language applies only to the exercise of judicial power.  That is made clear by its context, namely a judgment or order ""of the Court in a Division"".  In a passage cited with approval in this Court in Johnston v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 17; 62 NSWLR 309 at [30] (Spigelman CJ) and in Salter at [19] (Spigelman CJ), King CJ in Legal Complaints Committee v A Practitioner (1987) 46 SASR 126 at 127 stated:
""A judgment or order is a judicial act which decides the question or one of the questions which is raised for decision in the particular proceedings then before the court or judge.""
24It follows that no appeal lay, whether by leave or otherwise, from the determination of R A Hulme J, rejecting the application for an inquiry.  The only right of appeal arises pursuant to s 101 of the Supreme Court Act, which is limited to the exercise of judicial power, as opposed to administrative determinations.  
Review of administrative determination25The fact that the primary judge was not exercising a judicial function does not mean that his decision was beyond review.  If, for example, he purported to exercise a power which was not available as a matter of law, it may well be that this Court could intervene on the motion of a party having standing to seek the appropriate relief, either to set aside the decision or to grant a declaration.  An example of superior courts exercising such powers without the perceived need to determine first whether there was jurisdiction to do so may be found in the three levels of decision in relation to a claim by David Harold Eastman that he had been unfit to plead when tried and convicted of a murder in the Australian Capital Territory: Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) v Eastman [2002] ACTSC 35; 130 A Crim R 588 (Gray J); [2002] FCAFC 209; 118 FCR 360 (on appeal), and in the High Court, Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318.  The substantive issue in those proceedings was whether s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), which mirrored the earlier form of s 475 in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), extended to an inquiry into the fitness of the offender to plead at his trial.  The original determination of the Chief Justice of the ACT Supreme Court, somewhat anomalously reviewed by a single judge of that Court, was to direct an inquiry on the question of fitness to plead.  
26An application by the Director for a review of that decision and for a declaration that it was not a determination available under s 475 was rejected by Gray J.  That decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Federal Court, but, on further appeal, the High Court reinstated the decision of Gray J.  The consequence was that the inquiry directed by the Chief Justice was allowed to continue.  In the High Court, Heydon J (with whom all other members of the Court agreed other than McHugh J, who wrote separately but to similar effect) stated at [55]:
""The primary issue in the appeal was the construction of s 475.  Among the issues which the parties argued in writing, and came prepared to argue orally, were whether the Director had power to institute the Supreme Court proceedings; whether, if he did, he had power to appeal against Gray J's orders; whether he was a 'person aggrieved' for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act; and whether the time for commencing the second proceedings should have been extended.""
27That identification of the issues does not suggest that the function of judicial review, in one form or another, was not properly invoked.  Nor does any such issue appear to have been taken before Gray J.  Clearly the majority in the Full Court considered that such proceedings were available, because the effect of their order was to set aside the decision of the Chief Justice to order an inquiry.  Further, this Court may have power to grant declaratory relief in respect of a non-judicial determination by a single judge of the Court, purportedly exercising a statutory power, when that power is not engaged or, arguably, is exercised otherwise than in accordance with law.  As explained by the majority in the Full Court of the Federal Court, it would seem to be wrong in principle that a determination to hold an inquiry, involving mandatory powers to call witnesses and subject them to examination, should be exercised in circumstances where the power to direct such an inquiry has not arisen.  Similarly in a case where a review had been refused on a legally wrong basis, it would be unfortunate if the error were beyond correction.  The latter example is, perhaps, less persuasive than the former: refusal to direct an inquiry may be sidestepped by a further application.  Nevertheless, a further application on the same grounds might be refused without full consideration, pursuant to s 79(3).  Thus, if the only obstacle to review is the fact that the repository of the power is a judge of the Court, and if the right of review arises in the case where an inquiry is granted, it should be available where an inquiry is refused.  
28The question remains whether the scope of the power should be restricted to a wrongful rejection or acceptance of jurisdiction, or should extend to any error of law material to the determination.
29If there is no appeal against the determination of RA Hulme J in disposing of the application for an inquiry, the question is whether the Court can grant relief pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act.  That section assumes the existence of the power of the Court of Kings Bench to review the records of inferior courts and tribunals for jurisdictional error or error of law on the face of the record, by the issue of prerogative writs.  The section continues the jurisdiction but removes the power to issue a writ.  It thus preserves the power to grant appropriate relief but removes the procedural technicalities which historically accompanied the exercise of the jurisdiction.  With one possible qualification, it is not necessary to consider whether the procedural changes broadened the jurisdiction of the Court.
30The possible qualification relates to the principle that the prerogative writs ""went only to an inferior court"": Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58; 184 CLR 163 at 174, referring to The Queen v Metal Trades Employers' Association; Ex parte Amalgamated Engineering Union, Australian Section [1951] HCA 3; 82 CLR 208 and The Queen v Gray; Ex parte Marsh [1985] HCA 67; 157 CLR 351.  In Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 at [55] the High Court affirmed the proposition that a privative provision in State legislation ""which purports to strip the Supreme Court of the State of its authority to confine inferior courts within the limits of their jurisdiction by granting relief on the ground of jurisdictional error, is beyond the powers of the State legislature.""  The joint reasons returned to that issue at [107], noting that ""at least since federation, the State Supreme Courts have not been courts of unlimited jurisdiction.""  The joint reasons continued:
""Just as the amenability of a judge of a federal court to a writ of prohibition does not depend upon the court of which the judge is a member being an 'inferior' court, but upon the jurisdiction of the court being limited, the amenability of the Industrial Court to the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is a corollary of the Industrial Court being a court of limited power and the position which the State Supreme Court has in the constitutional structure.""
31For those reasons, the statutory designation of the Industrial Court as a ""superior court of record"" did not mean that it was exempt from review and orders in the nature of certiorari: at [106].  However, that conclusion may follow from the fact that the Industrial Court was a creature of statute and its jurisdiction therefore depended upon statute, rather than the general law.  The constitutionally protected jurisdiction of a State Supreme Court, as explained in Kirk, depended upon the existence of a jurisdiction at the time of federation which constituted a ""defining characteristic of the Supreme Court of the State"": at [55]; see also at [98].
32The present case does not involve the operation of a statutory privative clause, but it is nevertheless necessary to identify the limits of the Court's powers with respect to the exercise of power by a judge of the Court, from whose decision there is no appeal.  That question is unaffected by the reasoning in Kirk.  However, the point may be resolved by the conclusion that R A Hulme J was not exercising judicial power.  It may be inappropriate to divide all governmental powers of a State into the three categories of legislative, administrative (or Executive) and judicial, as distinct categories, each exclusive of the others; thus the conferral of a function on a judge of a superior court may be described as invoking a ""quasi judicial"" capacity.  There remains a question whether the immunity from review under general law principles operates.
33In Craig, the references at footnote (52) to the limits of the writ of certiorari include R v Gray; Ex parte Marsh, at 387.  Although that case dealt with control of a federal court, and the operation of s 75(v) of the Constitution, Deane J noted (at 388) that ""a clear distinction was drawn between the judicial and administrative functions of the old Arbitration Court in relation to the question whether a prerogative writ could be directed to it"", referring to The Queen v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33; 78 CLR 389 at 399-400.
34The principle was stated in similar terms by Lord Diplock in Re Racal Communications Ltd [1981] AC 374 at 384, considering an order of the Court of Appeal setting aside a decision of a single judge to refuse an order for access to papers held by a corporation.  Lord Diplock stated:
""There is in my view, however, also an obvious distinction between jurisdiction conferred by a statute on a court of law of limited jurisdiction to decide a defined question finally and conclusively or unappealably, and a similar jurisdiction conferred on the High Court or a judge of the High Court acting in his judicial capacity.  The High Court is not a court of limited jurisdiction and its constitutional role includes the interpretation of written laws.  There is thus no room for the inference that Parliament did not intend the High Court or the judge of the High Court acting in his judicial capacity to be entitled and, indeed, required to construe the words of the statute by which the question submitted to his decision was defined.  There is simply no room for error going to his jurisdiction, nor, as is conceded by counsel for the respondent, is there any room for judicial review.  Judicial review is available as a remedy for mistakes of law made by inferior courts and tribunals only.  Mistakes of law made by judges of the High Court acting in their capacity as such can be corrected only by means of appeal to an appellate court; and if, as in the instant case, the statute provides that the judge's decision shall not be appealable, they cannot be corrected at all.""  [Emphasis added.]
35It should therefore be concluded that the immunity of a superior court judge from correction for non-jurisdictional legal error does not extend to a determination made when not acting in his or her judicial capacity.
36Re Racal Communications involved the exercise of the power of review by the Court of Appeal: the House of Lords noted that that Court was not a common law court but a statutory court and thus did not enjoy the general powers of a common law court.  It is possible that the Supreme Court, even if relief were not available pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act, might have power pursuant to the general conferral of jurisdiction ""necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales"", by s 23 of that Act, to make a declaration as to legal rights and obligations.
37There is a further issue as to the availability of relief in the nature of certiorari.  Justice Hulme's decision did not directly affect any right or entitlement of the applicant, in the sense that it was and is open to him to make a further application, although if there were no change in the circumstances, it might be unlikely to succeed: see s 79(3) and Re Racal Communications at 385 (Lord Salmon).
38The principle as stated by the High Court appears to be that a quashing order will not be made where a decision does not directly affect the legal rights of the applicant or constitute a step in a process which may result in legal consequences: Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10; 175 CLR 564 at 580 (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ); Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [1996] HCA 44; 185 CLR 149 at 161-162 (Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ); Aronson and Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th ed, 2013) at [12.230].
39Following the decisions in Eastman referred to above, an inquiry was held to determine whether Mr Eastman had been unfit to plead at any stage of his trial: the judge concluded that unfitness had not been established and that there had been no miscarriage of justice.  A report was made to the Attorney-General for the ACT, who advised Mr Eastman that no further action would be taken.  Mr Eastman sought to challenge the conclusion of the inquiry by proceedings in the Supreme Court which invoked both the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 (ACT) and the issue of prerogative relief under the Supreme Court Act 1933 (ACT).  At first instance, Lander J held that the report had no legal effect and carried no legal consequences: Eastman v Miles [2007] ACTSC 27; 210 FLR 417 at [80].  That conclusion was upheld by the Court of Appeal of the ACT: Eastman v Australian Capital Territory [2008] ACTCA 8; 227 FLR 279 at [18].  For similar reasons, Lander J concluded that no declaration should be made (at [82]), a decision accepted by the Court of Appeal at [20]-[21].
40The assumption (noted above) that the decision to conduct an inquiry was open to review may not sit easily with the conclusion that the determination of an inquiry is not open to review.  The justification may lie in the nature of each determination which, at the preliminary stage was a positive determination requiring further action, but at the inquiry stage was a negative determination not leading to further action.  The present case is concerned with a negative determination at the preliminary stage.
41Aronson and Grove are critical of the decision in Eastman v Miles, suggesting that the Act should have been construed as requiring the Executive to consider the report and commenting that ""[a] court should be reluctant to interpret an Act as getting a judge to engage in a wholly useless exercise"": at [12.230].  The possible distinction between a negative and a positive outcome was not addressed.  However it is true that the precise scope of the test laid down in Ainsworth and Hot Holdings is not easy to identify and apply.  Because, for the reasons set out below, the challenge presented by the applicant must fail, it is undesirable to reach a firm conclusion as to the availability of relief, had an appropriate legal error been identified.
Nature of challenge42In order to understand the nature of the complaint made by the applicant with respect to his conviction, it is necessary to outline certain aspects of the evidence called at the trial.  The factual background was summarised by the trial judge in a judgment on sentence and reproduced by Heydon JA in the Court of Criminal Appeal at [3], in the following terms:
""Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis were friends, although not of long standing.  Mr Spathis had a business serving food at the Three Swallows Hotel.  Mr Patsalis was a patron of that hotel.  They shared certain interests.  In the year or so before Mr Ludwig's murder, Mr Spathis advanced $16,500 to Mr Patsalis by way of loan.  They gave strikingly different accounts of the circumstances in which the debt accumulated.  It was, however, acknowledged by Mr Patsalis that certain advances had been made in circumstances where he had deceived Mr Spathis.  The money was used for gambling, and lost.  Mr Patsalis was not in a position to repay the loan.  And so the friendship soured. It was in the context of that debt, that Mr Patsalis became acquainted with Mr Ludwig.
Mr Ludwig had a small business restocking cigarette vending machines.  One such machine was located in a small coffee house at Restwell Parade, Bankstown.  The coffee house was frequented mainly by persons of Greek origin.  They included Mr Patsalis.  Mr Patsalis was attracted by a card game in which patrons played for money.  Mr Patsalis met Mr Ludwig.  He discussed with him the prospect of obtaining cheap cigarettes, which was a matter of interest to Mr Ludwig.  Although Mr Patsalis may describe it otherwise, I am satisfied that he persuaded Mr Ludwig that he was able to arrange the supply of cheap cigarettes through contacts he had.  Mr Ludwig, on the evening he met his death, believed that he was travelling to a warehouse at Botany where he would exchange the cash he was carrying ($58,500) for a large consignment of contraband cigarettes.
The accounts given by Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis as to the events before and after the stabbing of Mr Ludwig were not remarkably different.  They met at 3.00pm at Mr Patsalis' flat.  Thereafter a number of purchases were made. There were two pairs of gloves, two knives, a tarpaulin, and one tin of petrol.  Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis differed from each other as to the circumstances in which the purchases were made, and their knowledge of the items purchased.  They both denied having any appreciation of the sinister purpose of these items, as revealed by the events of that evening.  I will return to this issue shortly.
Arrangements were thereafter made to meet Mr Ludwig at Bankstown.  Two vehicles were driven from Bankstown to the Marrickville RSL.  Mr Spathis drove his car [POZ 344].  Mr Patsalis was a passenger in the truck driven by Mr Ludwig.  It was common ground that Mr Spathis, having left first, doubled back in order to follow the truck, and thereby ensure that the truck was not being followed.  This fact was communicated to Mr Patsalis.  Both, therefore, knew that Mr Ludwig was alone.
Once at Marrickville, Mr Spathis parked his car.  He then entered the truck, sitting alongside Mr Ludwig, with Mr Patsalis on the other side, nearest the door.  Mr Spathis then drove to Botany.
At some point the vehicle parked by the side of the road at Botany. Whilst parked, Mr Ludwig was stabbed.  Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis each blamed the other for the stabbing.  Each asserted ignorance of the sinister purpose of the other.  Both acknowledged that money was removed from Mr Ludwig's jacket after the stabbing by Mr Spathis. Mr Spathis asserted (and Mr Patsalis denied) that he did so at the direction of Mr Patsalis.
Mr Spathis drove the truck back to Marrickville with Mr Patsalis as a passenger.  Mr Ludwig's body remained in the cabin.  Mr Patsalis then alighted. He thereafter drove Mr Spathis' vehicle. Mr Patsalis was covered with blood.  The car seat was protected by the plastic tarpaulin purchased earlier in the day.
The two vehicles were driven to Terrey Hills, although by a circuitous route. Each asserted the other led the way.  At Terrey Hills the body was removed from the cabin by Mr Spathis, and left by the side of the road.  It was doused in petrol.  Further money was removed from the jacket of the deceased.  The body was then set alight.  There were differences as to who removed the money, and who set fire to the body. 
The vehicles then left the scene, although in circumstances which were somewhat chaotic.  The burning of the body, and the rapid exit from the area, were witnessed by the occupants of a number of vehicles which were in the area.
The vehicles proceeded to Mr Patsalis' flat at Homebush.  Mr Spathis drove the truck, whilst Mr Patsalis remained in Mr Spathis' car.  Having met at Homebush, the two vehicles were then driven to Chester Hill, where the truck was set alight.  Mr Patsalis placed his bloodstained clothes inside the truck, so that they were also destroyed.""
43The applicant raised a number of issues on his application for an inquiry, not all of which were expressly dealt with by R A Hulme J in his reasons for rejecting the application.  He explained the approach he had taken, which was inevitably selective, given the volume of material put forward by the applicant, at [31].  The issue upon which the applicant focused in his challenge to R A Hulme J's determination concerned events following the murder.  The applicant had attended Bankstown Police Station at about 6.30pm on the day after the murder.  He answered certain questions and signed a handwritten record of the conversation in the notebook of a police officer.  He also handed over some written notes which he had prepared and which became Exhibit G at the trial.  He was not cautioned before making the statement or handing over the notes.  He contended that he should have been cautioned and that police officers had lied in their evidence as to what they knew at the time he made his statement and handed over the notes.  
44Before the Court of Criminal Appeal he complained that there had not been produced to him copies of police computer records for the time in question.  The issue was dealt with by Heydon JA in the following passage:
""[120] Patsalis indicated a desire to obtain production of certain computer records dated 12 April 1996 associated with the investigation into the murder of the victim.  He described what he hoped to prove thus: 
'I will prove that no police inquiry was made on the computer system until well after 6.30pm on the Friday evening of 12 April 1996. In the court transcript and on the voir dires in particular where counsel continually cross-examined the police officers their in court testimony was that at about ten past six in the evening of 12 April 1996 that they received a telephone call from particular witnesses i.e. Mr and Mrs Jeffries who passed on the car registration of POZ-344 which was the vehicle of Mr Spathis. And in turn they used that information to find out Mrs Spathis' home address at Randwick and they specifically testified to these events as being true and correct.
What I will be hoping to prove to the court are two matters: one is that no search was made until after 6.30pm on that evening. Two, that the in court testimony of the police officers was from the voir dires false and two particular police officers had in fact lied. Three, it then goes to the admissibility of Ex G and how it was illegally obtained and fourthly it will allow me to make further allegations that two witnesses' statements were manufactured in the police brief and I will be able to prove all that through those two documents.'
[121] Patsalis gave no satisfactory explanation for why he had taken no effective steps to obtain the documents in the twenty months that passed between his conviction and the hearing of the appeal.  The Crown said it had not received any notice since the trial that Patsalis wanted the material included in the appeal papers.  The Crown also said that the Registrar of this Court had warned Patsalis that all relevant material had to be before the Court by 2 July 2001.  And the Crown pointed out that even if the police records recorded no call before 6.10pm, it would not follow that none had been made.  None of these propositions was controverted by Patsalis. 
[122] Leaving aside the wholly unsatisfactory failure to bring this matter before the Court with appropriate speed and the fact that Patsalis evidently and unacceptably contemplated that the appeal could be adjourned as often and for as long as he desired, no substantive ground was made out for an adjournment of the appeal or for an order to be made under s 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  That is because the matter of whether Exhibit G was admissible was thoroughly investigated at trial.  Even if the production of the documents sought might have showed that some part of the relevant police officers' evidence was mistaken, it was not shown how any part of the trial judge's reasoning in support of the admission of Exhibit G was flawed in such a way as to raise any reasonable possibility that the conclusion was wrong. 
[123] Further, even if further police records would reveal that Exhibit G was handed in by Patsalis at a time when one of the circumstances described in s 139(1)(a) or (5)(a), (b) or (c) of the Evidence Act 1995 existed, it is inconceivable that the trial judge would have exercised his discretion under s 138 against reception of the evidence.  All the material factors bearing on the problem pointed towards admission.""
45By the time of the application for an inquiry, the applicant had access to the relevant records, which he placed before R A Hulme J.  After setting out the background and noting the provisions of ss 138 and 139 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), dealing with evidence improperly obtained from a person under arrest who had not been informed of his or her right to silence, the judge continued:
""[19] In this case, the applicant had voluntarily attended the police station, after having consulted with his solicitor.  He brought the notes with him, undoubtedly for the purpose of either providing them to police or relaying to the police their contents.  He went there for the purpose of giving the police his version of the events that occurred the previous day.  Even if the police believed that he had committed an offence, or that one of the other matters in s 139 applied, it is inconceivable that a failure to caution would result in this evidence being held to be inadmissible.
[20] A considerable amount of the purported 'fresh' or 'new' evidence, and the submissions made in support of the application, concern this issue.  I have considered all the material that has been put forward and do not have the slightest doubt as to the correctness of the trial judge admitting into evidence the notes and admissions made by the applicant.""
46The material which had been obtained was identified as annexures ""A"", ""B"" and ""C"".  Annexure ""A"" consisted of a printout of a computer record entitled ""NSW Police Service Inquiries Monitoring Report"" and set out inquiries which had been made of the Roads and Traffic Authority for a car bearing registration number POZ 344 on 12 and 13 April 1996.  The first recorded search, carried out by Detective Cooke, was recorded as being made at 18:37 hours on 12 April, that is after the time the applicant arrived at the police station.
47Annexure ""B"" was a statement prepared by Detective Senior Constable Robert Folpp.  Detective Folpp had been told of the discovery of the body of the deceased at 9.40am on Friday, 12 April 1996.  He had attended the location and secured the crime scene during that day, until 5pm when he returned to Mona Vale Police Station.  At 6.30pm he and Detective Sergeant Fitzgibbins attended a briefing at Chatswood.  He undertook further investigations later that evening.  
48Annexure ""C"" was a statement by Detective Sergeant Olen who also attended at the crime scene on 12 April 1996.  His statement revealed that at about 5.15pm he was handed two documents, including an envelope with handwriting in the following terms - ""Confidential open only after 2300 on Thursday 11/4/96 don't open if I ring or contact you earlier"".  At about 3.30pm, Detective Olen had obtained a copy of a handwritten letter marked ""K Peter Ludwig"" (being the name of the deceased) and had spoken to Detective Jubelin of the Homicide Unit, and sent to him by facsimile a document ""in relation to mobile phone number 019 366 513"".  
49The telephone number (which was the applicant's mobile number) was obtained from a letter, which referred to the applicant as ""Michael"", without reference to his surname.  The letter recounted meeting ""Michael"" to ""arrange things"".  On the basis of this material, the applicant submitted that ""once the facsimiled document in relation to mobile phone number 019366513 was cross-referenced with the elements ... emanating from Mr Ludwig's letter, all the police associated in the investigation of Mr Ludwig's murder, and specifically Det Olen, Det Jubelin and Det Jacob, sometime after 3.42pm and prior to 5pm on Friday, 12 April 1996, knew the applicant's surname and had compelling and overwhelming evidence which inter alia enabled them to instantaneously consider the applicant as the Prime Suspect in Mr Ludwig's murder"".
50The next step in the submission, was that Detective Jubelin, knowing that the applicant was the prime suspect, informed Detective McGillicuddy and directed Detective McGillicuddy to arrest the applicant.  Detective Jubelin gave evidence that he spoke with Detective McGillicuddy at approximately 6.40pm when the latter was at Bankstown Police Station.  (There was an issue as to who telephoned whom.)  According to the applicant, that evidence would not be believed, if it were accepted that Detective Jubelin knew that the applicant was a prime suspect prior to 5pm that afternoon.  The applicant supported his doubt as to the accuracy of the timing of the telephone calls, noting that the charge sheet recorded his arrest at Bankstown Police Station at 6.20pm on 12 April.
51The other element of the applicant's complaint is the prosecution evidence that shortly after the murder occurred, though without their knowledge of that event, a Mr and Mrs Jefferis (also referred to as Jeffries) had noted the car later identified to be that of Mr Spathis (the co-accused) being driven erratically at Terrey Hills, near the place where the victim's body had been dumped and burned.  They had provided the number to the police the following morning, after learning of the discovery of the body.  The applicant sought to contend, for reasons which need not be explored, that this evidence was false and that the police in fact got the details of the vehicle from the applicant himself.  (Why Mr and Mrs Jefferis would be involved in a fabrication of evidence was not explained.)  The allegation against them appears to have been part of a more general complaint as to fabrication of the prosecution case, rather than as part of the basis upon which the applicant's statement and notes should have been excluded.  However, the submissions on this relationship were confused.
52Enough has been said to make it clear that the issues sought to be raised before R A Hulme J were matters of fact.  They did not demonstrate any jurisdictional or other legal error on his part.
53Secondly, whilst it is true that R A Hulme J did not explore the detail of the allegations with respect to the state of knowledge of the police at the time the applicant attended Bankstown Police Station to make a statement, he approached the matter on the assumption that the officer who took the statement had reason to suspect the applicant and yet did not caution him before taking his statement.  His conclusion that the statement would not in any event have been excluded was clearly open as a matter of fact and rendered it unnecessary to consider the basis on which the assumptions rested and therefore demonstrated no error of law.
54For these reasons, the challenge to the determination to reject the application must be dismissed.
Orders55The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Dismiss the application for leave to appeal as incompetent.
(2) Dismiss the summons to the extent that it seeks relief otherwise than by way of seeking leave to appeal.
(3) Order the applicant to pay the costs of the respondent to the summons.

		16 October 2013",2013-10-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2762562,R v Villalon [2013] NSWSC 1516,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1Michael Villalon (""the accused"") has pleaded not guilty to an indictment in the following terms:
""That he did, on 28 February 2012 at Mascot in the state of New South Wales, murder Keith Owen Chaney.""
2The trial is fixed to commence on Tuesday 22 October 2013.
3By notice of motion dated 19 September 2013 the accused has made an application pursuant to s. 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (""the CPA"") that he be tried by a judge alone.  That application has been opposed by the Crown.
4Section 132 of the CPA is in the following terms:
132 Orders for trial by Judge alone (1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a ""trial by judge order"").
(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.
(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.
(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.
(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.
(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.
(7) The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that: (a) there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and
(b) the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.
5Section 132A(1) of the CPA requires that except with the leave of the court, an application under s. 132 is to be made not less than 28 days before the date fixed for trial.  The notice of motion in the present case was filed outside of that time period.  However, the Crown does not oppose a grant of leave to bring the application.  6The notice of motion is supported by an affidavit of Sophie Mae Williams, the solicitor for the accused, affirmed on 20 September 2013.  Paragraphs 6 and 7 of that affidavit are in the following terms:
""6. It is anticipated that the primary issue at this trial will be whether the accused should be found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter, on the basis that he was substantially impaired at the time he killed the deceased, pursuant to s. 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
7. On 12 December 2012 (a solicitor employed by the Legal Aid New South Wales) wrote to Ms Carla Black, a solicitor employed by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, indicating that the accused had instructed that he intends to plead not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the basis that he was substantially impaired at the time he killed the deceased, Keith Chaney.""
7Annexed to the affidavit of Ms Williams were three reports of specialist medical practitioners who, it is anticipated, will give evidence at the accused's trial.  Those reports are as follows:  
(i)a report of Dr Westmore of 12 June 2012;(ii)a report of Dr Allnutt of 5 April 2013; and(iii)a report of Dr Furst of 15 September 2013.
8The opinions of Drs Westmore and Furst are relied upon by the accused.  The opinion of Dr Allnutt is relied upon by the Crown.  I have made further reference to those opinions below.
9The Crown tendered a copy of the transcript of the accused's interview with police, along with a copy of the statement of Detective Flood, one of the investigating police.  The affidavit of Ms Williams and its annexures, along with the other material relied upon by the Crown, comprised exhibit A on the application.  
THE CROWN CASE10The following summary is taken from the Crown case statement.  
1. The accused was born in the Philippines on 29 August 1984. His parents are Maria Villalon and Francisco Villalon; Maria and Franciso separated some time prior to 1999.
2. In 1999 Maria Villalon travelled to Australia. In 2005 Maria was introduced to the deceased, Mr Keith Chaney, through a friend and they started dating soon after.
3. In 2006 the deceased purchased a house at 481 Gardeners Road, Mascot and both he and Maria moved in. In 2008 Maria returned to the Philippines as she was required by the Department of Immigration whilst her temporary visa application was under consideration. Maria then returned to Australia in 2009 after the visa was granted.
4. In April 2009 the accused and his sister Chelsy Villalon arrived in Australia to live with their mother and the deceased. The accused, the deceased and Maria lived inside the premises and Chelsy Villalon lived in the granny flat out the back with her boyfriend, Dandee Delacruz.
5. The accused returned to the Philippines in February 2011 but came back to Australia in October that same year.
6. On the morning of Tuesday 28 February 2012 Maria ate breakfast with the deceased and left home at about 6.55am to go to work. Maria finished work at about 4pm and caught the bus home. Maria got off the bus at approximately 5.30pm and walked to the house.
7. When Maria arrived home she saw that the front screen door of the premises was closed but unlocked and the wooden door was locked. It was daylight and there were no lights on inside.
8. Maria was unable to unlock the wooden door and knocked several times. She called the accused's mobile phone but received no answer. Maria then called the deceased's mobile phone and also received no answer. Maria states she then tried the back door but it too was locked, so she climbed in through a front window, gaining access by sliding the bottom half up.
9. Maria walked through to the kitchen area whereupon she noticed a broken figurine from a hallway cabinet lying on the floor. Maria turned the light to the kitchen on and saw the deceased lying on the floor with his head facing the back door. Maria stated she knew immediately that the deceased 'had already died' because she saw his face was covered in blood and a knife was sticking out of his eye. 
10. Maria then saw the accused walk out of his bedroom and she screamed at him in Tagalog, ""Why did you do this?"" Maria then contacted the police.
11. Constables Beckman and Stewart were the first officers to arrive at the scene at approximately 6.30pm. Const. Beckman was met at the front door by Maria who was screaming on the telephone at the time. Const. Beckman stated that the house was extremely dark because all lights were off at the time, such that he was required to use his flashlight.
12. Const. Beckman walked through the living room area towards the kitchen and saw the accused standing in the doorway with his hands in front of his face, palms facing outwards. The accused was wearing only a pair of shorts at the time. Const. Beckman noticed cut marks to the accused's left wrist.  He also saw a knife on the floor just behind the doorway where the accused was standing.
13. The accused moved towards Const. Beckman and it was then that Constable Beckman saw that the deceased had severe neck and facial injuries.
14. A crime scene was established and the accused was arrested and escorted to Mascot police station where he was charged with murder.  
15. An autopsy identified a fatal stab wound to the face of the deceased which partially transacted the upper cervical spinal cord.  
16. The accused was interviewed by police on 29 February 2012 in the course of which he made full admissions to stabbing the deceased in the chest and eye, as well as striking him with a figurine and a hammer.   
THE MEDICAL EVIDENCEDr Westmore11Dr Westmore examined the accused (at the request of the accused's solicitors) on 7 June 2012 and provided a report of 12 June 2012.  He diagnosed the accused as suffering from a psychotic illness.  He said that the differential diagnosis would include a paranoid schizophrenic illness or psychosis, occurring in the context of a depression.  Under the heading ""Opinion"" Dr Westmore said:
""Based on his history and the collateral history provided by his sister in particular as well as the clinical observations noted in the Justice Health file, I believe that Mr Villalon, on the balance of probability, was suffering from a psychotic illness at the time the homicide occurred.
The illness is likely to have been present for some time, certainly months, possibly years, further history would need to be obtained to clarify this.He reports a range of symptoms which are likely to be of psychotic origin. I also note however, the history of antagonism and conflict which existed between Mr Villalon and the deceased. To what degree his paranoid illness contributed to these particular difficulties is also unclear at this time.
Mr Villalon appears to have had paranoid and possibly psychotic symptoms in relation to the deceased, this occurring on the background of conflict between them.
Mr Villalon was suffering from an abnormality of mind (a paranoid psychotic illness) at the time of the homicide. He could raise the defence of substantial impairment, although it will be a matter for the jury to determine whether or not he was substantially impaired at the relevant time.""
Dr Furst12Dr Furst examined the accused (again at the request of his solicitor) and provided a report of 15 September 2013.  Dr Furst noted that the history obtained by Dr Westmore was similar to that which he had obtained from the accused and under the heading ""Opinion re diagnosis"" Dr Furst said:
""Mr Villalon presents with features of a psychotic illness that include paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, mood disturbance, a decline in his level of psychosocial functioning, and odd somatic experiences, believing that a snake was crawling inside of his chest. The presence of those symptoms over at least several months was consistent with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, paranoid type.
Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness often characterised by delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations, disorder of thought form, difficulty processing information, prominent mood symptoms, and bizarre behaviour as a consequence of the illness. There is often a prodromal period in which individuals with the illness feel lethargic, depressed and unable to cope, resulting in disruption to family relationships and poor social functioning.""
13Dr Furst then set out the provisions of s. 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) before continuing:
""In my opinion, his underlying schizophrenic illness probably impacted on his capacity to reason about his actions and their wrongfulness, meaning he may well have been substantially impaired at the time of the offence. He probably also lacked capacity to control himself by virtue of the perceived threats from the victim and his underlying condition in the form of schizophrenia.The issue of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind as a defence to the charge of murder will be a question for the trial (sic) of fact to determine; however, there is little doubt that he was suffering from a serious mental illness at the time of the offence, which has persisted over the course of the last 18 months whilst remanded in custody and has required ongoing assertive psychiatric treatment."" 
14Dr Furst then said:  
""Mr Villalon has evidence of an apparent schizophrenic illness, which constitutes a disease of the mind in the McNaughten's sense. His illness may well have prevented him from reasoning about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure; however, his thinking of the period following the offence, including concerns about the reactions of his mother and police, suggests he retained some knowledge of the wrongfulness of what he had done. He was probably not acting in response to delusional ideation about the victim alone, as there were apparent threats and other actions from the victim towards the accused that were offensive, which were confounding factors. These factors include conflict between the accused and the victim at the time of the offence and preceding the offence, unwanted sexual advances, sexual advances towards his younger sister and the issues surrounding child pornography.
Mr Villalon may well have the mental illness defence available to him; however, this issue is less clear than the apparent presence of substantial impairment as a defence.""
Dr Allnutt15Dr Allnutt examined the accused on 2 March 2013 at the request of the Crown and provided a report dated 5 April 2013.  Under the heading ""Opinion"" Dr Allnutt said:
""In my view, having regard to the information provided to me in his presentation, it is more likely than not that the Defendant commenced experiencing psychotic symptoms a number of years ago, possibly at the time that he first attended at Maroubra Medical Services, and was manifesting symptoms of a developing mental illness; these symptoms impacted on his social, occupational functioning and interpersonal relationships - a differential diagnosis would include schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia or psychotic depression.""


16In relation to the issue of substantial impairment, Dr Allnutt said the following:""If it is accepted that at the material time, at least some of his beliefs about the Deceased were erroneous or distorted by a paranoid bias, then there are grounds to conclude that at the material time that the alleged offending occurred the Defendant was suffering from an ''underlying condition"" (that is that he had a undiagnosed or early signs of a psychotic disorder); that as a consequence of his ""underlying condition"" he experienced a ""abnormality of mind"" (persecutory beliefs, referential thoughts, and auditory phenomena) around that time.
It is probable that his ""abnormality of mind"" impacted on his ""capacity to understand events"" making illogical an erroneous interpretation of some of the events relating to the Deceased, that led him to believe that the Deceased was conspiring with others to have him harmed in a serious manner; that the Deceased was putting various medications into the drinking water and milk attempting to harm his mother; and hearing a baby crying next door, or hearing a woman saying ""help, help"".
It is probable that these beliefs and perceptions would have contributed to a sense of justification with regard to his attack on the Deceased, driven by underlying feelings of anger, fear, and indignation at what he perceived at (sic) provocative behaviour on the part of the Deceased; on this basis he would be regarded as compromised in his ""capacity to judge right from wrong"", but this capacity was not completely negated, given evidence of knowledge of wrongfulness immediately afterwards.
If the course of events as described by him are accepted as fact, it would be reasonable to conclude that he was impaired in his ""capacity to control his actions"", given a combination of both real and distorted experiences in his relationship with the Deceased; that is, that both actual events and symptoms of mental illness would have contributed an exaggerated response to the interaction that occurred between he and thee Deceased just prior to the alleged offence.
On this basis I believe there are reasonable grounds to conclude that he has a defence of ""substantial impairment"" available to him.
In my view based on the information provided to me, he would also be regarded as having a ""disease of the mind"", namely schizophrenia with active symptoms of psychosis at the material time, causing a ""defect of reason"" (making irrational interpretations about the nature of his relationship with the Deceased believing the Deceased to be harming him) but it is likely that he would have been capable of knowing the nature and quality of his actions.""
17Finally, Dr Allnutt said: ""My preference is for a defence of substantial impairment - his abnormality of mind made him vulnerable to acting in an impulsive and aggressive manner towards the deceased, with loss of control, as a consequence of an exaggerated perception of the Deceased's intentions towards him.""
THE ISSUE AT TRIAL18It is apparent from the medical evidence that the principal issue at trial will arise from s. 23A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That section provides a partial defence to an offence of murder and is in the following terms:  
23A Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind 
(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if: 
(a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and 
(b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible. 
19As detailed further below, it is unlikely that there will be an issue that the accused was suffering from an impairment within the terms of s. 23A(1)(a).  There is, however, likely to be an issue as to whether the extent of that impairment was such as to fall within the terms of s. 23A(1)(b).
THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES20In R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; (2012) 217 A Crim R 1 McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was), having undertaken an exhaustive review of the authorities, distilled a number of considerations relevant to an application for trial by judge alone.  Those principles may be summarised as follows:  
(i)although s 131 provides for trial by jury ""except as otherwise provided"", the section does not have the effect of creating a presumption that the trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an accused person (at [96]; 25);
(ii)although the accused person carries an evidentiary onus the court does not determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a presumption of trial by jury is displaced. Given that each mode of trial has its particular characteristics, and depending on all of the circumstances relating to the particular case, the court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a trial before a judge alone rather than a trial by a jury (at [96]; 25);
(iii)subsection 132(5) acknowledges that when considering where the interests of justice lie, it will be relevant that where the trial involves an issue which may be informed by community standards or expectations the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of laypeople (at [96]; 25);
(iv)the legislation does not require weight  to be otherwise given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury as opposed to by a judge alone. The question for the court is whether it considers that it is in the interests of justice to make the order (at [96]; 25);
(v)the subjective views of an accused, and his or her belief that a jury trial may not be fair (as reflected in his or her desire to dispense with a jury) is a relevant factor to consider.  However, the fact that an accused person desires a trial by judge alone is not as significant as the reasons for that preference, whether those reasons are rationally justified, and whether they bear upon the question of a fair trial (at [99]; 26 and [102]; 26-27); 
(vi)Parliament has made plain by the enactment of s. 132(5) that it would be preferable in the interests of justice that there should be a trial by jury where an alleged offence involves the application of objective community standards (at [100]; 26);
(vii)the granting of an application which is based upon the mere apprehension of prejudice in prospective jurors, and which is not based on evidence or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice, is at odds with the assumption which the common law makes that jurors will understand and obey the instructions of trial judges to bring an impartial mind to bear on their verdict (at [102]; 26-27); 
(viii)it is to be assumed that the protections afforded an accused person in the ordinary course of a trial will protect him or her from an unjust result (at [107]; 27-28)    
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES21Counsel for the accused advanced four propositions which underpinned the application.  They were as follows:
(i)there was no real divergence in the medical evidence;
(ii)the medical evidence overwhelmingly favoured the conclusion that there was a substantial impairment to the accused's capacity in one or more of the senses contemplated by s. 23A(1)(a);  
(iii)the only possible issue in the trial was whether the impairment extended to the level contemplated by s. 23A(1)(b); and
(iv)the evidence left no room for any verdict other than that the accused was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment.  
22With these matters in mind, counsel submitted that in circumstances where the primary issue centred upon the accused's culpability, a trial by a judge alone was appropriate because questions of culpability were routinely determined by judges on sentence.  This, it was submitted, meant that a judge was well placed to make such a determination.   
23Secondly, counsel submitted that leaving the matter to a jury to determine would give rise to the possibility of a perverse verdict, and that it was in the interests of justice to grant the application so as to limit, or perhaps eliminate, that possibility, and to overcome the Crown's decision not to accept a plea of manslaughter.  In developing that submission, counsel argued that it should not be assumed that the law operated in such a way as to compel the involvement of a jury in a process which may result in an unjust outcome.    
24In this regard counsel referred me to the decision of Howie J in R v Hucker [2002] NSWSC 1068.  In that case, the accused's plea of guilty to manslaughter in reliance upon substantial impairment had been rejected by the Crown.  Almost at the end of the defence case, the plea was accepted.  His Honour proceeded to express his view that a finding that the accused was guilty of manslaughter was the only conclusion which was supported by the evidence.  As I understood it, counsel for the accused in the present case relied upon his Honour's observations as confirmation of the fact that there will be circumstances where the issue of culpability is so clear that the proper course is to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter.  Counsel submitted that the present was one such case, and that this was a factor which favoured the making of the order sought.   
25The Crown accepted, as I understood it, that the medical evidence supported the conclusion that the accused was suffering some impairment at the relevant time.  However, the Crown took issue with the assessment of the medical evidence which had been advanced on behalf of the accused. In particular, the Crown took issue with the proposition that the evidence was such that it only supported one verdict, namely that the accused was guilty of manslaughter.  The Crown stressed that the extent of the accused's impairment, and in particular whether such impairment extended to the circumstances referred to in s. 23A(1)(b), would be very much an issue in the trial.  
26The Crown submitted that this was not a case where the medical evidence was such as would render unjust a verdict that the accused was guilty of murder. The Crown submitted that it would be open to a jury to find on the evidence that any impairment was at the lower end of the scale, and not to the extent contemplated by s. 23A(1)(b).  
27The Crown further submitted that no relevant analogy was able to be drawn between the present situation and the role performed by a judge in assessing the culpability of an accused for the purposes of sentence.  It was further submitted that the issue for determination in the trial was intrinsically one for a jury, and that such a conclusion was consistent with the intention of the Parliament when enacting s. 23A.  In this regard, the Crown referred me to aspects of the second reading speech to that enactment, where the then Attorney-General was recorded as saying:
""Proposed new section 23A(1)(b) is the centrepiece of the new defence. It returns the jury to the central position of assessing the culpability of the accused person...
In coming to its verdict the jury brings to bear the community's collective wisdom and its sense of justice.""
28The Crown further submitted that the issue raised by s. 23A(1)(b) would necessarily involve the application of a community standard and that this was a factor which favoured a trial by jury.  In this respect he referred, in particular, to the observations of Macfarlan JA in Ziah v R [2013] NSWCCA 27 where his Honour said (at [76]):
""The appellant complains that the trial judge's direction to the jury to apply ""the community standard"" when considering whether the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter (s 23A(1)(b)) was erroneous. I do not agree. In directing attention to how an ""ordinary person"" would act, that paragraph clearly requires consideration of community standards.""29Similarly, the Crown relied upon the observations of Johnson J in Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229 where his Honour said (at [33]):
""It has been said that the issue under s.23A(1)(b) is a task for the tribunal of fact, which must approach that task in a broad commonsense way, involving a value judgment by the jury representing the community, and not a finding of medical fact:""
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION30It may well be the case that the ultimate issue in the trial centres upon the accused's moral culpability.  It may also be the case that assessments of culpability are routinely made by judges on sentence. It may follow from those circumstances that it would be suitable for a judge to determine the issue.  However, the question is not whether the circumstances of the case are ""suitable"" or ""appropriate"" for the making of an order that the trial proceed before a judge alone.  The question is whether or not it is in the interests of justice to do so.      
31In my view, and on the basis of the medical evidence before me, it would be open to a jury to conclude that the accused was suffering from an impairment at the time of killing the deceased.  I did not understand the Crown to argue to the contrary.  However, there is necessarily a remaining issue as to whether or not such impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.  Ultimately, the evidence may be capable of establishing that fact.  However I am not able, for a number of reasons, to accept the submission of counsel for the accused that the evidence is such as to leave no other finding reasonably open and that it is consequently in the interests of justice to order that the trial proceed before a judge alone.      
32Firstly, and fundamentally, the medical evidence which has been placed before me on this application is obviously in the form of reports.  None of the medical practitioners have been cross examined.  Whilst there is unanimity of opinion between the experts that it is open to the accused to raise the issue of substantial impairment, whether that defence is ultimately made out is a determination which can only be made on the whole of the evidence.  Unlike Howie J in Hucker (supra) I have not heard the whole of the evidence, or indeed anything approaching it.  As a consequence, I am not in a position to determine whether, as counsel suggested, this is a case in which the only possible outcome is that the accused will be found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.
33Secondly, for similar reasons, I am not able to accept the submission that an order for a trial by judge alone is necessary to overcome the possibility of a perverse verdict being returned by the jury.  Such a submission is burdened with a number of difficulties.  Firstly, it proceeds on an assumption that the evidence is capable of supporting only one verdict.  For the reasons I have already outlined, I am not in a position to determine whether that is the case.  Secondly, it disregards the assumption to which McClellan CJ at CL referred in Belghar (supra at [102]; 26-27) that jurors will understand and obey the directions of the trial judge.  Thirdly, it disregards the further assumption to which his Honour referred (at [107]; 27-28) that the protections afforded an accused person in the ordinary course of a trial will protect him or her from an unjust result.
34I am also unable to accept the proposition that the order sought is necessary to, in effect, overcome a decision by the Crown to reject the plea of manslaughter.  Doubtless there are cases where the issue of substantial impairment, and the evidence in relation to it, are so clear that it is proper to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter.  Hucker (supra) was obviously such a case although as I have already noted, the observations of the trial judge were expressed with the advantage of having heard almost the entirety of the evidence.  In the absence of hearing all of the evidence, it is not possible for me to determine whether the present case falls into the same category.  In any event, I do not consider that my role in determining the present application extends to supervising the Crown's exercise of its prosecutorial discretion.  
35I have identified the principal issue in the trial above (at [31]).  In my view, that is an issue which will be informed by the application of an objective community standard.  I am fortified in that view by the observations of Harrison J in R v Bretherton [2013] NSWSC 1036 at [25]:   
""The interplay between s 23A(1)(b) and (2) is important. The terms of s 23A(2) make it plain that the decision called for by s 23A(1)(b) is not in fact a medical or technical decision, even if the decision itself is likely, if not certainly, to be one that will have been informed by evidence of that type or character. Section 23A(2) makes it plain, as the Second Reading Speech was at pains to emphasize, that the factual matter requiring determination is at large, and is not in any way to be constrained or limited by expressions of opinion about it. It is abundantly clear that the opinion is one that calls up consideration of an objective community standard, being whether the extent of the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. That is a question upon which minds may differ, but is nevertheless an evaluative question that cannot, and ought not, be foreclosed.""

36Consistent with these observations, the jury will be directed that the issue raised by s. 23A(1)(b) is a matter for them to decide by the application of standards which they regard as prevailing in the community.  McClellan CJ at CL pointed out in Belghar (supra at [96] 25) that in such circumstances the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of laypeople.  Similar observations were made by Barr AJ in R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [28]:  
""I accept that the fact alone that community standards must be applied in the resolution of factual issues does not mandate trial by jury but, as subs (5) makes clear, it is a circumstance in which the jury may be considered to be the superior tribunal of fact.""
37For all of these reasons, I am not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the application for trial by judge alone be granted.
ORDERS38I make the following orders:
(1)I grant leave to the accused to make application pursuant to s. 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act for a trial by judge alone;
(2)I dismiss the application.

		24 July 2014",2013-10-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762565,R v Villalon [No. 2] [2013] NSWSC 1568,"Judgment1On the first day of the trial, in the latter stages of empanelment of the jury, the court reporter who was present in court at the time drew my attention to the fact that one of the jurors who had been empanelled was known to her as a former member of the Court Reporting Branch.  That information was confirmed by a second court reporter who came into court shortly thereafter and who also recognised the person in question also as a former colleague.
2This information was conveyed to counsel immediately upon the conclusion of my opening remarks to the jury, at the time of the luncheon adjournment.  I indicated to counsel what had been reported to me at that point and asked them to give it such consideration as they thought fit during the course of the adjournment.   
3Upon resumption of the proceedings counsel for the accused, Mr Winch, sought clarification of whether or not the identity of the juror as a former court reporter had in fact been confirmed.  I informed him that the information had been provided to me by the two court reporters independently of each other, and that in these circumstances I saw no reason to undertake any further enquiry for the purposes of confirming it.
4Mr Winch then made an application that the entire jury be discharged.  In advancing that application, he made three submissions.
5The first was that the juror in question had, as a consequence of her former employment, an intimate knowledge of courtroom procedure and what was described as ""court craft"".
6The second submission, which appeared to arise from the first, was that the juror's previous experience and knowledge placed her in a different position from that of her eleven colleagues.
7The third submission was that the juror in question may have knowledge of matters which were germane to these proceedings, which, but for her former employment, she would not otherwise have had.  
8The application to discharge the jury was not supported by the Crown Prosecutor, who essentially advanced two submissions.  
9The first was that nature of work undertaken by a court reporter was such that she would only have been in court for intermittent periods of a trial.  As I understood it, the Crown sought to draw a comparison between that position, and that of, for example, a member of the public who is generally at liberty to be present in court through the entirety of the proceedings.
10The second, and more substantive, submission advanced by the Crown was that nothing arising from the fact of the juror's former employment gave rise to an assumption that the juror in question would do anything other than properly discharge her responsibilities in accordance with her oath.
11It is a fundamental principle of the system of criminal justice that jurors will take heed of, and act in accordance with, directions which are given to them by a trial Judge (see for example R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603 per Mason CJ and Toohey J, applied in Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470 per Barr J at [153] (Spigelman CJ and Price J agreeing). Criminal trials necessarily proceed in accordance with this general principle.  
12It may well be that as a consequence of her former employment the juror in question has knowledge of court procedures and proceedings which the other members of the jury do not have. As a consequence, that may place this particular member of the jury in a different position to that of her colleagues. Neither of those matters, in my view, forms a proper basis on which to conclude that the juror in question will act irrationally, will not follow directions which are given, or will otherwise act contrary to the oath or affirmation that she took at the time of her empanelment.
13Further, there is nothing before me which suggests, in any way, that as a consequence of her former employment, the juror in question possesses any knowledge at all of matters which are germane to these particular proceedings. It might also be added that prior to the empanelment of the jury, I addressed the panel in waiting at length about various matters and provided each of them with an opportunity to make application to be excused.  The juror in question made no such application.  
14In those circumstances, I am not of the view that the jury should be discharged.
15Accordingly the application is refused.

2762589,R v Warren ROSS (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 2042,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: On 25 October 2013, the Court issued rulings on the admissibility of certain evidence sought to be tendered and used as tendency evidence. There was also an application that certain evidence of the deceased's mother not be admitted because of the manner in which it was obtained. 
2The latter application was dismissed and the Court ruled that the evidence of the deceased's mother in a conversation preliminary to statements to police was not inadmissible on the basis of an impropriety in the manner in which it was obtained. No ruling has been made on the admissibility of the evidence otherwise. 
3The Crown seeks to tender evidence referred to in the Tendency Notice issued by the Crown under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 on 17 October 2013. Tendency evidence is also sought to be adduced by the accused and a notice was produced on 25 October 2013, although reference was made to the evidence prior to the production of the notice. 
4The tendency evidence upon which the accused relies relates to the mother of the deceased and seeks, by statements and/or evidence of prior conduct, to prove a tendency to be violent when angry, to show no remorse for her violence and/or to discipline her children, including the deceased, in an excessive way involving violence. It also seeks to adduce tendency evidence in relation to the two older siblings of the deceased proving, by reference to prior conduct, school documents, medical records and prior statements of others, that one or each of the children are violent in the home to her family members and, in the case of the older sibling, violent at school to other children for no apparent reason without, in any of the foregoing, displacing any remorse.
5No objection is taken to the tendency evidence sought to be adduced by the accused. It is allowed, if for no other reason, under the provisions of s 97(2)(b) of the Evidence Act. 
6The tendency evidence sought to be adduced (or used in that way) by the Crown was the subject of notice, as earlier stated. It seeks to adduce evidence in relating to the tendency of the accused and, by that evidence, prove that the accused has a tendency to act in a particular way, namely, to assault the deceased ostensibly for the purpose of disciplining her, but far in excess of what was reasonable using his hands or feet or objects; and/or to assault the deceased in a high state of anger associated with a loss of control of himself. 
7It also seeks to adduce evidence showing a tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely, to intend that harm be caused to the deceased by his assaults or to be indifferent to the effect such assaults had upon her; and/or to be indifferent to her age and level of understanding when engaged in disciplining her. Objection is taken, by the accused, to the admissibility of the evidence and/or its use for a tendency purpose. 
8On 25 October 2013, at the conclusion of the argument and the time taken to read the statements of evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely, the Court provided a ruling in the following terms:
""[1] Because the Crown no longer presses the evidence, it is unnecessary to state an attitude to the admissibility of the conversation between Ms X and Ms Deaves.
[2] As to the remainder of the application to reject evidence on the basis of impropriety in the manner in which it is said to have been obtained, the application is rejected and the evidence of Ms Deaves is, in that respect, admissible.
[3] I make the following rulings on the admissibility of the evidence that is subject to the Tendency Notice and its use:
Carly Knight Admissible Able to be used as tendency evidence Suzanne MunroAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidenceJessica GrayAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidencePeter CooperAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidenceJennifer CooperAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidenceDavid WilsonAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidencePaul CokerAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidenceWendy CokerAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidenceMichael Shelton Not admissibleNot able to be used as tendency evidencePaul MerrittNot admissibleNot able to be used as tendency evidenceLinda Hannan Not admissibleNot able to be used as tendency evidenceOldest sisterAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidenceMiddle sisterNot admissibleNot able to be used as tendency evidence Mother of diseasedAdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidenceBasil Deaves AdmissibleAble to be used as tendency evidence
[4] The foregoing is not a reference to all of each of the statements, only to the paragraphs relied on for tendency purposes.
[5] Further, the foregoing ruling deals only with the tendency issue and no other ground of objection.
[6] Reasons for the foregoing rulings are reserved and will be issued as soon as practicable.""
Facts
9This matter is being dealt with by way of preliminary hearing so that the parties are in a position to understand that which will be admitted (and for what purpose) at the time of the opening to the jury. As a consequence, the facts are not established and the nature of the case of the Crown, including any possible answer to it, has not been developed. The Court has been provided with each of the statements and/or other documents that are the subject of objection and, of course, has a statement of the Crown Case. 
10The substantive hearing deals with a charge of murder against the accused, who is alleged to have inflicted fatal injuries on the daughter of his partner. The deceased was 2 years and 8 months old at the time of her death. 
11The accused's partner at the time was the deceased's mother. They had been in a relationship for a short time, approximately two months. The deceased had two older sisters at the time of her death, each of whom lived with the mother and the accused. 
12The mother moved into property, which later became the alleged crime scene, on or about 29 June 2011. 
13The accused apparently had been attempting to toilet train the deceased. The Crown case is that he was frustrated that she would not learn as quickly as he had expected and threatened to leave the deceased's mother on account of the tension in the relationship caused by these events. The accused, apparently, commenced the toilet training regime about four weeks before the deceased's demise. 
14At the time that the fatal injuries were occasioned, there were four persons, it seems, in the household other than the deceased. They were the accused; the mother; and the two older sisters. The deceased died of a cerebral haematoma caused by haemorrhaging, in turn occasioned by injury to the head. 
15The allegation, largely contained in the evidence of the mother, is that the accused became frustrated during a course of punishment, which I will outline later, took the deceased into the bathroom banged her head on the shower screen or wall of the shower whilst showering the deceased after she had soiled herself. 
16After banging her head against the shower, the accused, it is said, held the deceased over the toilet, then dropped her to the floor and kicked (or pushed her with a leg) across the wet wooden floor resulting in her head hitting the door of a closet so hard that she bounced back partially, whereupon the accused repeated the conduct. The deceased, it is said, banged her head twice on the closet door. 
17It is not clear, from the medical evidence that I have read, whether the head injury was caused by the banging of the head on the shower wall or the banging of the head on the closet, assuming, in each case, that the events occurred as described by the mother. 
18The accused seeks to adduce evidence, to which there is no objection, of the attitude of the mother, earlier described, her lack of remorse, her anger management issues and her history of occasioning greater punishment than was appropriate to her children. The accused also seeks to adduce evidence of the violence of each of the older sisters towards the deceased and other children. Each of those, presumably, is for the purpose of raising the reasonable hypothesis that a person other than the accused may have inflicted the fatal injuries, assuming they were inflicted by somebody and not the result of a fall or accident. 
19The Crown seeks to adduce evidence in a number of categories. Those categories can be broadly described. They relate to a number of incidents associated with the treatment or alleged treatment of the deceased by the accused. 
20The first incident was an assault, allegedly by the accused, on the deceased approximately one month before the fatal injuries occurred. The assault occurred in the street and, it is said, was witnessed by a number of independent witnesses. 
21The evidence of Carly Knight is central to this episode. She describes the incident in graphic terms. The man, later identified as the accused, picked the smaller child off the ground by the arm and struck the child with his other hand so hard that the child flew through the air. The accused then walked past the child (and Ms Knight) yelling while he did. Ms Knight telephoned the police and informed them of what she had seen. The police responded. Ms Knight then went on holidays and on her return saw the picture of the deceased on the front page of the newspaper, contacted the police and identified the deceased as the younger child struck by the accused on the earlier occasion and then identified the accused from a range of photos. 
22The incident was also witnessed by Peter and Jennifer Cooper and Suzanne Munro. Mr and Mrs Cooper identified a different date for the incident and there are inconsistencies between the details of the incident seen by Mr and Mrs Cooper, Ms Munro and Ms Knight. Nevertheless, albeit based only on the reading of a statement, the evidence of Ms Knight is probative and the differences in the description of the incident seem to relate more to the usual differences between that which is seen and/or recalled by observers of an incident. 
23The foregoing incident was also described by Jessica Gray and the same comments apply thereto. 
24The next incident upon which the Crown relies in their Tendency Notice is evidence of punishments meted out by the accused on each of the children and in particular the deceased. That evidence derives from the statements of each of the older sisters, the mother and David Wilson. Each of the mother and two older sisters describe punishments over a number of days, if not weeks, during which time the accused was said to have been seeking to toilet train the deceased. 
25The version of events given by the middle daughter (the younger of the two older sisters) relates to punishment meted out to her (as distinct from the deceased) and otherwise is insufficiently detailed to justify the drawing of an inference as to inappropriate or excessive punishment of the deceased that would be more probative than prejudicial. 
26Mr Wilson's statement alleges that he attended on the house of the accused in order to buy marijuana from him. In the course of that visit, he witnessed the deceased running laps of the living room and noticed an injured hand. Each event was explained by the accused in terms that might be suggested was evidence of prior conduct that also discloses a prior state of mind from which a jury may draw an inference of an admission, of unusual and excessive punishment of the deceased and of the accused's state of mind while the punishment was being effected at the time that the fatal injuries were inflicted. The statement of the accused is not adduced as an admission but, rather, as part of the conduct to establish state of mind and to evidence repeated conduct of excessive abuse.
27The third incident to which I will refer is an incident described by neighbours of the accused and the mother, being Mr and Mrs Coker. They describe an incident in which, subject to proper identification of the sounds heard and the voices, the accused whipped and/or otherwise abused the deceased. It was not the occasion when the fatal injuries were occasioned. 
28The next incident or incidents relate to the evidence of Michael Shelton, Paul Merritt and Linda Hannan. 
29Mr Shelton lived with the accused and the mother for a short period of time. He describes the accused's discipline of the deceased in very general terms. This material does not provide sufficient detail to satisfy the Court that its probative value outweighs the prejudice afforded to the accused by it being adduced.  . He does however describe yelling and screaming and bruises on the deceased's body, including on her back, upper arms and legs. He testifies to suspicion, but gives no direct evidence, of the detailed mistreatment of the deceased. Mr Shelton testifies to the fact that he spoke to the accused about his mistreatment of the children, but does not recall the details of the conversation. 
30Mr Merritt, who lived nearby, assisted the accused with some mechanical work on a motor vehicle. He testifies as to the relationship between the three children and the accused. Part of that evidence relates to the deceased doing laps of the lounge room and to a racist comment relating to the children's skin colour. Mr Merritt testifies to hearing one of the girls screaming loudly (without identifying which girl) one night in the week prior to the death of the deceased, but otherwise does not identify the child. In my view the prejudice is great and the probative value problematic and I do not consider this evidence significantly probative (s 97) of the fatal conduct; nor do I accept that the evidence, if adduced, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect (s 101). 
31Ms Hannan works for a group that provides support for persons with mental health problems and attended meetings with the mother of the deceased. To the extent that the evidence of Ms Hannan is sought to be used against the accused by the drawing of an inference relating to conduct or state of mind, the evidence is extremely general and not especially probative. 
32The foregoing summary of evidence is not intended to be a full summary of the evidence to be given or seemingly to be given by each of the witnesses. Nor is it intended to give a summary of all that each of the witnesses might say that is relevant. Rather, it addresses that which the Crown relies upon for the drawing of the inferences on the basis of tendency as to the accused's conduct and state of mind at the time the fatal injuries were inflicted and seeks to have the evidence admitted and used as tendency evidence in the proceedings against the accused. There is some evidence in the foregoing that is not necessarily inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. I do not deal with that evidence or the admissibility of that evidence. 
The Provisions of the Evidence Act
33As that which this judgment seeks to deal is evidence adduced by the Crown against the accused to be used as tendency evidence, the most relevant provisions of the Evidence Act are ss 55, 97, 101 and the definition of ""probative value"". 
34Section 55 of the Evidence Act prescribes that evidence is relevant in a proceeding if it is ""evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding"". The definition of ""probative value"" is the ""extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"". In other words, given the not unexpected alignment of the definition of that which is relevant and probative value, probative value is, loosely, the extent or degree to which evidence is relevant. 
35The structure of the Evidence Act, as has been pointed out on a number of occasions, is that all relevant evidence is rendered admissible (s 56 of the Evidence Act), unless the Act provides for particular evidence to be inadmissible. 
36Section 97 is one of those provisions in the Evidence Act that operates to exclude certain evidence, unless the evidence meets certain criteria. The terms of s 97(1), the sub-section most relevant to these issues, is as follows:
"" s 97 The tendency rule
(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:
(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence; and
(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.""
37We can ignore, for present purposes, the provision requiring reasonable notice. No issue arises in these proceedings or in this objection as to the notice provisions. 
38As can be seen from the foregoing recitation of the provision of s 97(1) of the Evidence Act, evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person or a tendency that the person has or had is not admissible to prove that the person has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind unless the Court is satisfied that the evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence, has significant probative value.  
39Further to the foregoing condition for admissibility, the provisions of s 101 apply because the evidence is sought to be adduced by the Crown against the accused, and requires that the probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect on the accused. The relevant terms of s 101 are as follows: 
""s 101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution
(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.
(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.""
Principles and Consideration 
40As may be clear from the foregoing, and is otherwise trite, the first hurdle for the admissibility of any evidence under the tendency rule (or any other provision of the Evidence Act) is that the evidence is relevant. During the course of discussion in a number of cases the term ""relevant"" is used when discussing the hurdle of ""significant probative value"". This infelicitous expression is understandable, given the obvious relationship, previously identified, between the definitions of ""probative value"" and ""relevant"". Nevertheless, to avoid doubt, I reiterate that evidence cannot be considered under s 97 of the Evidence Act unless it is relevant as described in s 55 of the Evidence Act. 
41Once it is appreciated that a proceeding involves an issue as to the state of mind of a particular person or the probability of that person acting in a particular way, material that goes to a history of that state of mind or a history of conduct of like kind would, generally, rationally affect the probability of the occurrence of the state of mind or the existence of the conduct at the relevant time. It may, of course, not prove the state of mind or the conduct. Sometimes, it may prove the opposite. Other times it may affect the probability of the existence of the state of mind or occurrence of the conduct less than significantly. Nevertheless, in the case of evidence that is said, rationally, to be evidence of a tendency, the relevance test is a relatively minor hurdle. 
42A significantly greater hurdle is the exclusion of the material as admissible, unless the material is of a significant probative value. The submissions on behalf of the accused, in these proceedings, in part, relied on inconsistencies, reliability and credibility. The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 (Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Adams JJ) considered whether the assessment of probative value under s 97(1)(b) and s 101(2) should take account of issues of credibility and reliability. The Court there held (see [61]-[65]) that such issues should not be taken into account. Nevertheless, there is a necessity to take issues of that kind into account in some circumstances. There are times when the issues of credibility and reliability are so profound that a fact finder would not be capable of relying upon the evidence, if admitted. 
43The question that must be answered is whether the material ""could rationally affect"" the assessment of the probability. If it could rationally affect (and sometimes any effect would not be rational and other times the effect would be so minimal that it could not be relied upon), then it is relevant to the issue to which it goes. As stated by Simpson J in Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; (2006) 162 A Crim R 233 at [124]:
""Underlying s 97 is an unstated but obvious premise. That is that proving that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind in some way bears upon the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. The fact in issue is the conduct, or state of mind, on a particular occasion relevant to the issues in the proceedings, of the person whose tendency is the subject of the evidence tendered. That is, evidence that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind is not tendered in a vacuum. It is tendered for the purpose of further proving (or contributing to proving) that, on a particular occasion, that person acted in that way or had that state of mind. Proof of the tendency is no more than a step on the way to proving (usually by inference) that the person acted in that way, or had that state of mind, on the relevant occasion.""
44It is the test in the statute, rather than the common law, to which one must look in dealing with the admissibility (and use) of materials sought to be tendered for the purpose of proving a tendency. Nevertheless, the common law history of the admissibility of such evidence may be used as a guide in the necessary assessment of the material's probative value.  As I stated in KJR v R [2007] NSWCCA 165; (2007) 173 A Crim R 226 at [44], that which is rendered impermissible and inadmissible by s 97 is the chain of reasoning that allows prior conduct to be used to prove relevantly present conduct, not necessarily the fact of the prior conduct itself. In KJR, I said:
""[42] The common law may be used as a useful guide to an understanding of the provisions in both ss 97 and 98 but, ultimately, the terms of the statute prevail: R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161 (per Simpson J, with whom I agreed); R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338 (per Simpson J at [60], with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed and per Rothman J at [157]); R v Ellis (2003) 144 A Crim R 1 (per Spigelman CJ, with whose reasoning the High Court agreed, see [2004] HCA Trans 488, p 40-41).
[43] While there are similarities between the provisions of s 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act, there are distinctions and the purpose of each section is different.
[44] The purpose of s 97 of the Evidence Act, dealing with tendency evidence, is to render impermissible a chain of reasoning and not necessarily a state of facts. If the inadmissible chain of reasoning is the only purpose for which the evidence is adduced, as a matter of law, the evidence is not admissible: DPP v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 453, per Lord Hailsham.
[45] The chain of reasoning that is rendered impermissible by s 97 is that chain of reasoning which:
... shows only that the accused has a propensity or disposition to commit a crime or that he or she was the sort of person to commit the crime charged ... It was also accepted that in order to be admissible, propensity evidence must possess 'a strong degree of probative force' or the probative force ... must clearly transcend the prejudicial effect of mere criminality or propensity."" (Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 480-481 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) (emphasis added).""
45The exercise is not in the strict sense discretionary. It is an evaluative process in which the Court is required to assess whether the obstacles prescribed by s 97 (and, in this case, subsequently in s 101) have been satisfied. 
46Tendency evidence is likely to be highly prejudicial: R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 at [104] and it is, fundamentally, for that reason that the provisions s 97 and s 101 have been promulgated. 
47In this instance the various incidents of conduct go to essential and important issues in the trial: the identity of the person or persons (if any) inflicting the injuries; and the state of mind of that person. 
48The tendency evidence is also adduced for the purpose of disproving any innocent explanation for the infliction of the injuries. In terms of the issues to which the evidence goes, it is highly important. 
49Further, in terms of the manner in which the evidence may properly be used, it is being used not merely to show that the accused is likely to engage in criminal conduct, or even criminal conduct of a particular kind. Rather, it is being used to show a propensity to conduct himself in a particular manner towards this particular deceased at or about the time at which the injuries occurred, the motive for that conduct and the state of mind of the accused in engaging in that conduct. 
50Further, and importantly, the facts as disclosed, including the tendency it may establish, support evidence otherwise available of the conduct of the accused in a way that affects whether there is a reasonable hypothesis consistent with the injuries occurring by accident or the injuries occurring at the hand of another. 
51In each case, the evidence will, if accepted, have significant probative value. 
52Moreover, given that it is sought to be adduced by the Crown against an accused and that the additional requirements of s 101 apply, I make clear that notwithstanding the likelihood that evidence of this kind will have a prejudicial effect, the probative value of this evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. I take into account, in the latter assessment, the directions that I anticipate will be made in relation to the use of the evidence. 
53As is made clear from the terms of the orders I have issued, I do not consider that the evidence of Mr Shelton, Mr Merritt and Ms Hannan, nor the evidence of the younger of the two sister witnesses meet the tests to which I have referred. That latter evidence is neither admissible, under s 97, nor able to be used as tendency evidence pursuant to the terms of s 101 of the Evidence Act. 
54As made clear in the ruling that I have recited, I have not dealt with the admissibility of that evidence, here ruled inadmissible as tendency evidence, for any other purpose. Nor have I dealt with any other objection that may be taken to the evidence that I have ruled to be admissible or capable of being used as tendency evidence pursuant to the provisions of s 101 of the Evidence Act.

		20 August 2014",2013-10-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762600,R v Brown [2013] NSWSC 1557,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Carl Brown (the offender) has been found guilty by a jury of the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez on 12 October 2010. 

2Mr Ruiz-Sanchez died when he was struck on the head with a shotgun by Samuel Lockett which then discharged, mortally wounding him. The deceased was 38 years old at the time of his death. 

3The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period has been prescribed of twenty years imprisonment. Those two guideposts are to be borne in mind when the court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120; (2011) 281 ALR 652. 

4Although the offender was individually tried before a jury, Samuel Lockett was also found guilty by a jury of the murder of the deceased. Richard Barnes, Bradley Owen Trawin-Hadfield and Kirk Daniel Tuivaga pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased which was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment charging them with murder. With no disrespect to these offenders, I will refer to them furthermore by their surnames during these sentencing remarks. 

5In view of the separate trials for the offender and Lockett and the differences in the agreed facts upon sentence for the remaining offenders, it is necessary to deliver separate sentencing remarks for each offender. However, the parity principle is of importance when sentencing each of them and is not confined to sentences imposed upon co-offenders who have committed the same crime. It can also be applied to sentences imposed upon persons who are co-offenders by virtue of having been engaged in the same criminal enterprise, regardless of the charges that have been actually laid against them: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462; (2011) 86 ALJR 36 at [30]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [136]. However, the significant practical difficulties with this approach are well recognised: Jimmy at [203]; Green at [30]. 





6In the present case, there is little utility in considering parity with the three offenders who pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The roles that they played in the death of the deceased were much less than the offender and Lockett and there is a deal of difference between the maximum penalties for murder and for manslaughter. The question of parity is considered at [32] below. 

7During the trial and proceedings on sentence, Mr P Leask appeared for the Crown and Mr M Ainsworth appeared for the offender. 

8It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offender which are to be founded on the evidence adduced in his trial. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202 at 204. I should state at the outset that I found Rhiannon Knaggs to be an impressive witness. 

9The genesis of the events that led to the deceased's death is found in the purchase of a pistol by the offender for $600 from the deceased. The offender said that he would pay for the pistol on the following day, but he did not do so. The deceased tried to call the offender a number of times and had left voice and text messages. According to the offender, the deceased had left messages about payment and in a telephone conversation with the deceased, they had an argument and he told the deceased not to leave messages like that on his answering machine (ex H p 9 Q & A 60).





10On 12 October 2010, all five offenders drove together to Jasmine Psaroudis' house at Mt Pritchard which was next door to the deceased's home. Ms Psaroudis is the offender's sister. On the way to Mt Pritchard, they stopped at Trevor Hair's place at Canley Heights where the offender picked up a shotgun. The offender was in the front passenger seat of the vehicle and the shotgun travelled on his lap. Barnes was the driver and Lockett, Tuivaga and Trawin-Hadfield were seated in the rear of the vehicle. 

11In his ERISP interview, the offender described the gun as a ""one shotter...you can't pump six shells into it"": Ex H (p 19 Q & A 168). The offender said that he knew the gun was loaded: Ex H (p 21 Q & A 188). He carried the gun which was wrapped in a jumper into his sister's house. Each of the offenders went into Ms Psaroudis' house where they remained for about half an hour. 

12The offender told police that he gave the gun to Barnes saying ""...hold this, I want to go over next door and fucken have a couple of words with this bloke"": Ex H (p 17 Q & A 142). All of the offenders moved next door to the home of the deceased. 

13The deceased was in the kitchen making dinner whilst his partner Rhiannon Knaggs and her friend Ashley Riddell were making baby shower invitations. Ms Knaggs heard the offender calling out the deceased's name. 









14The deceased went out onto the front verandah where he was confronted by the offenders, one of whom had brought the gun. After Ms Knaggs heard a bang on the screen door, she ran to the door where she saw all of the offenders on the verandah less than a metre away from the deceased. The offender had a soft drink bottle in his hand and was pointing at the deceased. The offender was saying ""You want to leave smart arse messages"" and ""I'll show you who a gangster is"" (T17/6/13 T60 L13-16). Ms Knaggs described all of the men punching the deceased. She said that the offender punched him on the left eye and the deceased wiped the blood off his face. She recalled leaving the screen door to phone for help, but the offender said ""If your missus calls anyone I'll shoot her"" (T17/6/13 T60 L20). 

15Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell gave evidence that Lockett hit the deceased once on the head with the shotgun and the shotgun discharged. Ms Psaroudis said that she saw Lockett hit the deceased on the head and everytime he did so, she heard a crack. She heard the crack three times. 

16Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell were in a much better position to see what took place on the front verandah than Ms Psaroudis who was looking through the window of her house. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Lockett struck the deceased more than once with the shotgun. After the gun discharged, all of the offenders ran away and the gun has not been located.

17Dr Bailey, the forensic pathologist, gave evidence that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the deceased's head. Other than the wounds caused by the shot gun pellets, Dr Bailey found evidence of blunt force trauma that included some lacerations around the face and eyes of the deceased. She described other abrasions and haemorrhages to the deceased's body. In cross-examination, Dr Bailey said that some of the injuries might be in part due to a terminal collapse. 

18The Crown case against the offender was brought upon the principles of joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise. It is evident from the jury's question during their deliberations that the verdict of murder was returned as the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender and Lockett were parties to an agreement to assault the deceased, that in the course of carrying out the agreement and whilst the offender continued to be a party to the agreement, Lockett deliberately struck the deceased on the head with the shotgun, with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm on him. The jury found that although the infliction of grievous bodily harm was not within the agreement, the offender contemplated that in the course of carrying out the agreement to assault the deceased, a party or parties to the agreement might deliberately apply physical force to the body of the deceased without his consent and at the time that party did so, he had the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm on him. 

19The jury found that the offender participated in the joint criminal enterprise by himself assaulting the deceased with the contemplation that a party or parties to the agreement might do an act with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the deceased and at the time Lockett deliberately struck the deceased on the head with the shotgun, the offender intentionally assisted or encouraged him. The jury was satisfied that Lockett's deliberate act in striking the deceased on the head with the shotgun made a substantial contribution to the deceased's death. The offender is to be sentenced on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise murder. 

20The evidence of events before the attack upon the deceased is confined to the offender's ERISP interview and Ms Psaroudis' testimony. The jury was not satisfied that the agreement between the offenders to assault the deceased was formed before they entered the front yard of his home. 



21It was the offender, however, who had the dispute with the deceased over the payment for the pistol and was angry over the phone calls and text messages. He obtained the shotgun which he knew was loaded. He led the other four offenders to the deceased's home in order to confront him. He called out to the deceased and made threats to him. He encouraged the others to assault the deceased and joined in the cowardly attack by punching him. He raised the level of potential violence by threatening to shoot Ms Knaggs which was shortly followed by Lockett striking the deceased with the shotgun. 

22Matters that mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence are that the agreement to assault the deceased was not entered into until shortly before he was attacked and the offender's lack of contemplation that the deceased would be killed. Neither the offender nor Lockett anticipated that the shotgun would discharge when the deceased was struck with it. Neither of these offenders had an intention to kill the deceased. I conclude that the objective seriousness of the offence is below the middle of the scale for the offence of murder. 

23The offender was born on 14 August 1983. He was 27 years old at the time of the offence and is now 30 years old. His criminal history as an adult reveals other than traffic offences, a conviction for larceny (2008) and convictions at the Parramatta District Court on 27 May 2011 for two counts of reckless wounding whilst in company on 4 October 2009. The agreed facts for these offences disclose serious acts of violence by the offender. 









24These prior acts of violence do not increase the objective seriousness of the murder, nor are they objective circumstances for the purpose of the application of the proportionality principle and do not determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. In view of the offender's prior violent offending, I give more weight to personal deterrence and protection of society than otherwise would have been the case: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. I take into account the need for general deterrence. 

25At the time of the murder, the offender was on bail for the offences of reckless wounding whilst in company. It is an aggravating factor that the murder was committed whilst the offender was on bail for these offences: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

26The offender did not give evidence during the trial or the proceedings on sentence. His background is drawn from a pre-sentence report that was prepared for the offences of reckless wounding and a document entitled Carl Brown History prepared by his solicitors. The offender is the youngest in a family of five children. When the offender was two, his father was sentenced to three years imprisonment. He returned to New Zealand upon completing his custodial sentence. The offender's relationship with his stepfather began when he was seven years old. The offender did not bond with his stepfather who he reports to have been an alcoholic and violent to the children and his mother. The offender has a good relationship with his mother who has been supportive of him throughout his life. The offender has been in a relationship with his partner Julie for six years. They have a four year-old daughter. Both have visited him whilst in custody. 





27The offender left school at the end of Year 9. The solicitors report that he has a learning difficulty and cannot read or write well. He was employed as a forklift driver when he was 18 years old and obtained his forklift licence. He lost this employment when he was 23 years old and has been unemployed since that time. 

28The solicitors report that the offender commenced taking cannabis at the age of 15 and moved to harder drugs by the age of 20. The author of the pre-sentence report makes reference to the offender's claim of starting to use methylamphetamine in 2007 but records the offender's report of not using any illegal drugs for twelve months which his mother supported. I take into account the offender's difficult family background and personal circumstances. 

29Mr Ainsworth pointed to the offender's expressions of regret during the ERISP interview as indicating his contrition for the offence. Mr Ainsworth made particular reference to Q & A's 34, 157 and 436 (though it appears that he intended to refer to Q & A 430).

30Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. Although the offender expresses his regret in the ERISP for the deceased's death and the impact that might have on Ms Knaggs, he places the blame for what occurred on Lockett. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the offender has acknowledged the loss caused by his actions. Furthermore, the offender pleaded not guilty to the murder. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has accepted responsibility for his actions. 




31During the proceedings on sentence, no submissions were specifically made as to the offender's likelihood of re-offending or prospects of rehabilitation. In my opinion, the commission of the offence whilst on bail for offences involving violence encourages a pessimistic view being taken. Notwithstanding his family support, I am unable to make a finding on the balance of probabilities that the offender is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

32When sentencing Lockett, I discussed the question of parity at [32]-[35] of the sentencing remarks: R v Lockett NSWSC [2013] NSWSC 1555. I concluded that Brown and Lockett were equally culpable for the murder. Mr Ainsworth did not submit otherwise. However, the differences in the subjective circumstances of Lockett and Brown justify a lesser sentence for Lockett. Lockett's criminal history does not disclose any previous convictions for offences involving violence whereas Brown had committed two offences of reckless wounding whilst in company in 2009. I have assessed Lockett to a limited extent to be remorseful, whereas no finding of remorse is made for Brown. Furthermore, I found that Lockett is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation whereas I was unable to make such a finding for Brown. In Lockett's case personal deterrence did not have a significant role to play, whereas for Brown more weight is given to personal deterrence and the protection of the community. 

33Victim impact statements from Ms Knaggs, Maria Vinas, the deceased's mother, and Virginia Ruiz-Sanchez, his sister, were read to the court. The contents of these statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's partner and his family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 





34Mr Ainsworth submitted that the offender's sentence should commence on 12 January 2012. This was the date he was to be released to parole for the offences of wounding in company. For these offences he had been sentenced in the District Court on the first count to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months commencing on 13 October 2010 with a non-parole period of 12 months and on the second count to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months commencing on 13 October 2010 and expiring on 12 April 2013 with a non-parole period of 15 months expiring on 12 January 2012. 

35As the offender has served these sentences since he went into custody, it is necessary to consider the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. The offences for which the offender was sentenced in the District Court and the offence of murder are discrete and independent acts of criminality. This fact does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. In the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to commence the sentence on the date that the offender would have otherwise been released on parole being 12 January 2012. 

36I find special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term of the sentence as the offender needs the assistance of drug and alcohol counselling upon release. I have determined that a non-parole period of 13 years 9 months is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63]. 





37Carl Brown for the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of 19 years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 13 years 9 months commencing on 12 January 2012 and expiring on 11 October 2025 with a balance of term of 5 years 3 months commencing on 12 October 2025 and expiring on 11 January 2031. 

38The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 11 October 2025. 

39I ask Mr Kaufmann to advise the offender of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and of its application to the offence for which he has been sentenced.

		25 October 2013",2013-10-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762603,R v Lockett [2013] NSWSC 1555,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Samuel Lockett (the offender) has been found guilty by a jury of the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez on 12 October 2010. 

2Mr Ruiz-Sanchez died when he was struck on the head with a shotgun by the offender which then discharged, mortally wounding him. At the time of his death he was 38 years old. 

3The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period has been prescribed of twenty years imprisonment. Those two guideposts are to be borne in mind when the court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120; (2011) 281 ALR 652. 

4Although the offender was individually tried before a jury, Carl Brown was also found guilty by a jury of the murder of the deceased in a separate trial. Richard Barnes, Bradley Owen Trawin-Hadfield and Kirk Daniel Tuivaga pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased which was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment charging them with murder. With no disrespect to these offenders, I will refer to them furthermore by their surnames during these sentencing remarks. 

5In view of the separate trials for the offender and Brown and the differences in the agreed facts upon sentence for the remaining offenders, it is necessary to deliver separate sentencing remarks for each offender. However, the parity principle is of importance when sentencing each of them and is not confined to sentences imposed upon co-offenders who have committed the same crime. It can also be applied to sentences imposed upon persons who are co-offenders by virtue of having been engaged in the same criminal enterprise, regardless of the charges that have been actually laid against them: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462; (2011) 86 ALJR 36 at [30]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [136]. However, the significant practical difficulties with this approach are well recognised: Jimmy at [203]; Green at [30]. 

6In the present case, there is little utility in considering parity with the three offenders who pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The roles that they played in the death of the deceased were much less than the offender and Brown and there is a deal of difference between the maximum penalties for murder and for manslaughter. The question of parity is considered at [35] - [38] below. 

7During the trial and proceedings on sentence, Mr P Leask appeared for the Crown and Mr C Smith appeared for the offender. 

8It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offender which are to be founded on the evidence adduced in his trial. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Matters of mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202 at 204. I should state from the outset that I found Rhiannon Knaggs to be an impressive witness. 

9In written submissions, Mr Smith suggested a factual basis for sentencing the offender which included that Brown attended the deceased's home in September 2010 and obtained a gun from him which Brown did not pay for over the next three weeks. Mr Smith disclosed that the suggested factual basis is largely taken from R v Lockett [2013] NSWSC 859 at [4]-[13] which was my judgment on the separate trial application. The Crown, however, did not adduce evidence in the offender's trial of the purchase of a gun by Brown. Accordingly, I decline to make further reference to this topic in these sentencing remarks. 

10On 12 October 2010, the five offenders were together at the Smithfield house where Tuivaga and Brown were living. At some stage during the day, they drove to Jasmine Psaroudis' home in Russell Street, Mt Pritchard which is next door to the deceased's home. Ms Psaroudis is Brown's sister. 

11On the way to Mt Pritchard the car stopped at Trevor Hair's place. Brown went into the house and obtained a gun which was placed somewhere in the front of the car. Barnes was the driver of the vehicle and Brown was seated in the front. The offender was seated in the rear of the vehicle with Tuivaga and Trawin-Hadfield. 

12Barnes drove the vehicle to Russell Street, Mt Pritchard. Each of the offenders went into Ms Psaroudis' house. Shortly before 7:30pm, they moved next door to the home of the deceased. According to the offender, Brown said ""let's go next door"": Ex J (p 19 Q & A 159). The offender told police that Brown carried the gun with him to the house: Ex J (p 20 Q & A 161). The offender did not know the deceased. 

13The deceased was at home with his partner Rhiannon Knaggs and her friend Ashley Riddell. Ms Knaggs heard Brown calling out the deceased's name. Brown had been to the house before and Ms Knaggs had previously seen him about a dozen or so times. The deceased went out onto the front verandah where he was confronted by the offenders, one of whom had brought the gun. Ms Knaggs heard a bang that she described as being like a screen door being hit. She grabbed a baton because she was scared and went to the screen door with it. Ms Knaggs said that all five offenders were hitting the deceased with their fists. She testified that she saw the offender hit the deceased with both fists. She recalled leaving the screen door at one point to get her mobile phone, but said she did not get very far because Brown threatened her by saying ""Get your missus off the phone, otherwise I will shoot her"" (T27/5/13 T55 L50). 

14Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell gave evidence that the offender hit the deceased once on the head with the shotgun and it discharged. Ms Knaggs thought that the gun was a metal pipe before it discharged. She said the offender struck the deceased once on the left side of the head, there was an explosion and she felt blood hit her face and body. She described the offender hitting down so that the open end was on the deceased's head. Ms Riddell said that the offender hit the deceased on the head with what she thought was a long pole, there was a loud bang and she then realised that the pole was a gun. 

15Ms Psaroudis said that she saw the offender hit the deceased with something a couple of times. She heard a couple of cracks which made her cringe. Ms Psaroudis described the object she saw the offender hitting the deceased with as looking like a piece of wood or metal. She realised it was a gun when she heard a bang and saw smoke and pellets. 

16Dr Bailey, the forensic pathologist, gave evidence that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the deceased's head. Other than the wounds caused by the shotgun pellets, Dr Bailey found evidence of blunt force trauma to the face of the deceased. She also described multiple lacerations. She was unable to say whether the peri-orbital bruising to the face was due to the discharge of the shotgun or a punch or kick. In cross-examination Dr Bailey said she could not exclude the possibility that the injuries around the left eye of the deceased may have been due to a terminal collapse. 

17Mr Smith submitted that the court would accept the evidence of Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell that the offender struck the deceased once with the gun and would reject Ms Psaroudis' evidence which suggested that there was more than one such blow. Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell were in a much better position to see what took place on the front verandah than Ms Psaroudis who was looking through the window of her house. Senior Constable Aumua estimated that there was approximately six metres between the two houses. Furthermore, there was a real possibility that the deceased's van was parked in the driveway between the window from which Ms Psaroudis looked and the verandah next door. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the deceased more than once with the shotgun. 

18After discharge of the gun, all of the offenders ran away and the gun has not been located. It was a shotgun, as Dr Bailey recovered in the post-mortem some pellets and wadding which indicated it was a non-rifle firearm. The gun does not appear to have been professionally manufactured. 

19The Crown invited me to find that each of the offenders knew that Brown had obtained a firearm for the purpose of making a surprise attack upon another person (CWS par 15). Mr Smith contended that the court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew the weapon was a gun before it discharged as distinct from some sort of pole and the attack upon the deceased was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. The evidence in the offender's trial as to what occurred before the attack upon the deceased is confined to the evidence of Ms Psaroudis and the offender's ERISP interview (ex J). 

20It was the offender's case at trial that he did not know that Brown had obtained a gun. In his ERISP interview, he said that ""it looked like a trolley pole"" (p 43 Q & A 326) and did not have a trigger (p 51 Q & A 404). He described its colour as being ""shiny silver"" (p 42 Q & A 323) with brown sticky tape at the end. 

21The offender's description of the gun is similar to the descriptions of the weapon given by Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell. He did not collect the weapon from Trevor Hair's home nor is there evidence that he had possession of it other than immediately before he struck the deceased with it. His use of the weapon to strike the deceased supports the offender's contention that he did not know it was a gun. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew that the weapon was a gun before it discharged. 

22The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the offender deliberately struck the deceased on the head with the gun, he did so with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm on him and that although the offender's deliberate act was not the direct or immediate cause of death, it made a substantial contribution to the death of the deceased. Furthermore, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not act in the defence of one of the other offenders. 

23It was a serious act of violence for the offender to strike the deceased on the head with what he thought was a pole with the intention of inflicting really serious physical injury on him. By doing so, he escalated the level of violence. He had previously struck the deceased with his fists, as had other offenders. This was a cowardly attack upon a man who was outnumbered on the front verandah of his home and in the nearby presence of his partner.

24The Crown did not contend before the jury or on sentence that the offender deliberately discharged the shotgun or that he ought to have contemplated that it would discharge, or that the offender intended to kill or that he knew the shotgun was loaded. In the circumstances of this crime the absence of these factors reduces the objective seriousness of the murder. Another factor that mitigates the objective seriousness of the offence is that the offender's involvement in the attack upon the deceased was relatively spontaneous. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his intention to assault the deceased was not formed until he entered the front yard of the deceased's home. 

25Mr Smith invited me to find as a matter reducing the objective seriousness of the offence that the attack was not prolonged but I decline to do so as the attack was brought to a sudden end by the discharge of the shotgun. I conclude, however, that the objective seriousness of the offence is below the middle of the scale for the offence of murder. 

26The offender was born on 7 August 1983. He was 27 years old at the time of the offence and is now 30 years old. Other than traffic offences, his prior criminal history reveals convictions for the supply of a prohibited drug (2004), two counts of possession of a prohibited drug (2007) and possession of a prohibited weapon (2010). I note that the offender does not have any previous convictions for offences involving violence. The offender's criminal history does not disentitle him from considerations of leniency. 

27At the time of the murder, the offender was subject to a suspended sentence of 6 months imprisonment for the offence of possession of a prohibited weapon. It is an aggravating factor that the offence was committed whilst the offender was subject to conditional liberty: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

28The offender did not give evidence during the trial or the proceedings on sentence. His background is drawn from the affidavits of his father, brother and sister-in-law, together with the report of Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist. The offender is the youngest of four boys. His mother died from a drug overdose when he was fifteen years of age. Roy Lockett, the offender's father, was a long distance truck driver which resulted in less frequent face to face contact with his son. His father states that the offender ""has had a hard time since his mother passed away and has been forced to grow up and become independent very quickly"" (ex 2 par 3). Shane Lockett, the offender's brother, noted that the offender was left alone at times, started skipping school and became reliant on his friends. After completing Year 11, the offender left school and worked at a pet shop, as a builder's labourer and with an electronics company. He has been continuously employed since leaving school. I take into account the offender's difficult family background and personal circumstances. 

29His reported history of substance abuse includes regular use of cannabis between the ages of 18 and 21 and regular use of methamphetamine in the years before his arrest. Dr Nielssen diagnosed substance use disorder (in remission), depressive illness and anxiety disorder. Dr Nielssen explained that the diagnosis of depression was made ""on the basis of the history of a syndrome of depression and aspects of [the offender's] presentation during the recent interview"" (ex 1 p 5). The diagnosis of an anxiety disorder such as post-traumatic stress disorder was made ""on the basis of [the offender's] account of intrusive anxiety provoking memories and distressing flashbacks to the offence itself, and re-experiencing of the trauma itself triggered by witnessing violence on television"" (ex 1 pp 5-6). Mr Smith did not submit that the offender's mental condition was related to his offending or had any impact on his time in custody or lessened the need for general deterrence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194. Nevertheless, I take into account Dr Nielssen's psychiatric diagnoses. 

30In a letter to the court, the offender expresses his ""intense sorrow and remorse for [his] actions in destroying not only [the deceased's] life but also many others"" (ex 10). Both Lauren and Shane Lockett express their belief that the offender is very sorry for the part he played in the deceased's death. The offender told his father that he greatly regretted the deceased's death. 

31Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. Whilst I accept that he has acknowledged the loss caused by his actions, he pleaded not guilty to the murder. It appears from Mr Smith's submissions that he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter, but a plea to manslaughter was not entered before the jury. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the offender has fully accepted responsibility for his actions. I take into account to a limited extent remorse as a mitigating factor. 

32The offender states in his letter that he has spoken at ""great length with the minister for counselling"" and has involved himself in continuous work since his incarceration (ex 10). Reverend Baines the prison chaplain writes that the offender is ""still in a state of shock"" over the death, but is eager to seek counsel and improve his life (ex 6). The offender is described as a most co-operative and compliant inmate who is a hard working member of the maintenance team. This is a trusted position. 

33Lauren Lockett observes in her affidavit that since the offender entered prison, she has noticed a change in him for the better. She states that he has made an effort to work and participate in various programs. Dr Nielssen assessed the offender as having good prospects for long-term rehabilitation. Michael Clark, a painting and decorating teacher, was thoroughly impressed with the offender's attitude during the trade based training program in which the offender participated. He found the offender to be extremely courteous and attentive, with a keen interest to learn a trade skill which had previously been alien to him. Two certificates demonstrate the education programs that the offender has completed (ex 8). 

34Although the offender manifests limited remorse, his relative youth, the lack of prior violent offending and the positive steps taken whilst in custody suggest that he is unlikely to re-offend in this way again. I consider that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g)-(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Accordingly, personal deterrence does not have a significant role to play in my sentencing task. I take into account the need for general deterrence. 

35Both Mr Crown and Mr Smith submitted that when considering the parity principle, Brown's role in the commission of the offence was more than Lockett's. Mr Crown submitted that Brown was ""the controlling mind"" who recruited the others into a violent and cowardly endeavour because of his ""personal offended pride"" (CWS pars 19, 21). Mr Crown argued that his lesser degree of actual physical involvement was outweighed by his role that was instrumental in the deceased's death. Mr Smith referred to Brown's role as the leader of those engaged in the criminal enterprise. 

36Brown is to be sentenced on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise murder. 

37I am not persuaded that Brown's culpability for the murder is greater than Lockett's. Although it is true that Brown obtained the shotgun that he knew was loaded, had the relationship with the deceased and initiated the confrontation with him, it was the offender's extreme act of violence in striking the deceased on the head with the shotgun that caused the deceased's death. I assess them as being equally culpable for the murder. 

38There are however important differences in the subjective circumstances of these offenders which justify a lesser sentence for Lockett. His criminal history does not disclose any previous convictions for offences involving violence whereas Brown had committed two offences of reckless wounding whilst in company in 2009. I have assessed Lockett to a limited extent to be remorseful, whereas no finding of remorse is made for Brown. Furthermore, I found that Lockett is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation whereas I am unable to make such a finding for Brown. In Lockett's case personal deterrence does not have a significant role to play, whereas for Brown more weight is given to personal deterrence and the protection of the community. 

39Victim impact statements from Ms Knaggs, Maria Vinas, the deceased's mother, and Virginia Ruiz-Sanchez, his sister, were read to the court. The contents of these statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's partner and his family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

40My attention was drawn by Mr Smith to various cases. They have been of assistance, but each case depends on its own circumstances. 

41I find special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence being the offender's need for psychiatric, drug and alcohol counselling upon release. I have determined that a non-parole period of 13 years is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63]. 

42The offender was arrested on 18 November 2010 and has been in continuous custody ever since. This is the agreed date for the commencement of the sentence. 

43Samuel Lockett for the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 18 years consisting of a non-parole period of 13 years which is to commence on 18 November 2010 and is to expire on 17 November 2023. I set a balance of term of 5 years which is to commence on 18 November 2023 and will expire on 17 November 2028. 

44The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 17 November 2023. 

45I ask Mr Smith to advise the offender of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and of its application to the offence for which he has been sentenced.

2762605,Jamal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWCA 355,"Judgment
1MEAGHER JA:  I agree for the reasons given by Gleeson JA that the orders his Honour proposes should be made.
2GLEESON JA:  Mr Jamal seeks relief in the nature of prerogative relief with respect to a judgment of the District Court which was an appeal from a conviction in the Local Court.  The circumstances giving rise to the appeal to this Court are as follows.
3On 10 November 2011, Mr Jamal was found guilty in the Local Court of common assault of his wife - a statutory offence created by s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 - and sentenced to a conditional good behaviour bond for 12 months: s 9, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999.  He appealed against his conviction to the District Court: s 11, Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001.
4Consequent upon the conviction for assault, the Local Court also made a final apprehended violence order against Mr Jamal for two years the protected persons being Mr Jamal's former wife and their three children: s 39(1), Crimes (Domestic & Personal Violence) Act 2007.  Mr Jamal also appealed to the District Court against this order: s 84(2)(a) and s 84(3), Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.
5The appeals were heard over two days on 23 March and 1 June 2012.  Relevantly, the appeal on conviction was dismissed.  The District Court confirmed the conviction and the sentence imposed by the magistrate, but amended the terms of the apprehended violence order: Jamal v R (District Court of New South Wales, Nicholson DCJ, 1 June 2012, unreported). 
6On 29 June 2012, Mr Jamal filed in this Court a summons naming the Director of Public Prosecutions as the respondent.  The summons identified the type of claim as ""Procedure - Fairness - Natural Justice"".  The summons did not identify the relief claimed but, it may be inferred, purported to seek judicial review of the dismissal of his conviction appeal by the District Court.  
7An amended summons was filed on behalf of Mr Jamal on 17 July 2012 by JR Lawyers.  The District Court was added as a second respondent.  The District Court has filed a submitting appearance.  On 30 August 2012, Mr Jamal's lawyers filed a second amended summons in the same terms as that originally filed by Mr Jamal.
8On 22 January 2013, Mr Jamal's solicitors filed a third amended summons together with written submissions confusingly headed ""Criminal Appeal Act 2012"".  The amended summons claimed relief under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), in respect of which this Court has no jurisdiction.  The grounds upon which relief is sought concern Mr Jamal's complaint that he was denied procedural fairness during the hearing of his appeal to the District Court.
9Subsequently, on 9 September 2013, Mr Jamal filed a further amended summons, together with further written submissions, which were expressed to be supplemental to the earlier written submissions.  The relief claimed includes that the order of the District Court dismissing his appeal on conviction be quashed, that the order of the Local Court convicting Mr Jamal be set aside and that proceedings be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with by a magistrate, other than the magistrate who dealt with the assault charge.
10Mr Jamal was represented before this Court by Mr Cairns of Counsel.  Mr Pickering SC appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  
The basis for Mr Jamal's proceedings
11Mr Jamal invokes the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court conferred by s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 to seek to quash the decision of Nicholson DCJ of 1 June 2012.  Review under s 69 extends to relief formerly available by writ of certiorari.  However, it is necessary to consider whether there is any legislative constraint on the Court's exercise of its powers to quash or otherwise review a decision: s 69(5).
12In the present case, the appeal function that the District Court performed was undertaken in the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction of that Court: s 9(2) and s 166 of the District Court Act 1973.  Part 4 of the Act headed ""The Criminal Jurisdiction of the Court"" includes s 176 which provides:
""No adjudication on appeal of the District Court is to be removed by any order into the Supreme Court.""
13The effect of s 176 is not to exclude proceedings by way of judicial review by this Court, but to limit their availability to cases involving jurisdictional error: Garde v Dowd [2011] NSWCA 115; (2011) 80 NSWLR 620 at [10] per Basten JA (Giles JA and McColl JA agreeing).  See also Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74 at [15]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Emanuel [2009] NSWCA 42; (2009) 193 A Crim R 552 at [18] and [45]; and Elias v Director of Public Prosecutions [2012] NSWCA 302; (2012) 222 A Crim R 286 at [5]; Yousaf v Director of Public Prosecutions [2012] NSWCA 397 at [12] per Barrett JA (McColl JA and Meagher JA agreeing).
14Accordingly, the only question that may be agitated in this Court on the matters raised by the amended summons is whether the decision of the District Court on appeal from the Local Court is affected by jurisdictional error.  
Jurisdictional error 
15In Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; (1995) 184 CLR 163, the High Court gave a broad description of jurisdictional error as follows (at 177):
""An inferior court falls into jurisdictional error if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises that jurisdiction does exist. Such jurisdictional error can infect either a positive act or a refusal or failure to act. Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes of the writ where it makes an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it lacks, or refuses to exercise, jurisdiction) which is based upon a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the nature or limits of jurisdiction.""
16Thus a jurisdictional error is a failure to comply with an essential precondition or limit to the valid exercise of a power, whether either the precondition or power arises under the general law or under statute: Spanos v Lazaris at [15].  
17One recognised form of jurisdictional error is a failure to accord procedural fairness during a hearing: Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [60].  Such a failure is susceptible to correction as jurisdictional error: Re Refugee Review Tribunals; Ex parte HB [2001] HCA 34; (2001) 179 ALR 513 at [10]. 
Mr Jamal's complaints
18On the hearing of the application, counsel for Mr Jamal clarified that the only issue raised was that there had been a failure to afford Mr Jamal procedural fairness in the District Court appeal.  This failure was particularised as relating to four matters: 
(1)Mr Jamal was not afforded the opportunity to be legally represented.
(2)Mr Jamal's application for an adjournment (on 1 June 2012) was refused.
(3)Mr Jamal was not afforded the assistance of an interpreter (on 1 June 2012).
(4)The District Court refused to receive and consider further evidence on the hearing of the appeal and, in that respect, to exercise the power conferred by s 18(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  
19Counsel for Mr Jamal informed the Court that he did not rely upon the failure particularised as (iv) in the third amended summons filed 22 January 2012, being refusal of Mr Jamal's request that the Crown particularise with certainty the date of the alleged assault.  It should also be noted that Counsel for Mr Jamal did not press any of the complaints contained in the further amended summons filed by Mr Jamal on 9 September 2013, which largely related to refusal of access to subpoenaed documents.
20In support of the first three complaints, counsel for Mr Jamal drew attention to various passages of the transcript of the District Court appeal on 23 March and 1 June 2012 as indicative of the language barrier that may have posed problems for Mr Jamal.  He acknowledged that Mr Jamal had a day-to-day command of the English language and had some legal training in the Egyptian system, but contended that Mr Jamal was out of his depth before an appeal court.  (Mr Jamal gave evidence before the Local Court that he was a solicitor (in Egypt): Tcpt 51, line 14).  
21Counsel for Mr Jamal submitted that the absence of an interpreter and the absence of legal representation were relied upon as distinct aspects of the failure to afford procedural fairness.  He went on to submit that Mr Jamal also relied upon a combination of these two matters.
22In support of the fourth complaint, counsel for Mr Jamal submitted that Mr Jamal was attempting by the application to tender further evidence, to lead evidence of the victim's association with community groups and others to demonstrate that there was an abundant opportunity for the victim to complain of the alleged assault, but that no complaint was ever made.  It was submitted that this information would have balanced the competing versions of the evidence of the victim and Mr Jamal as to whether he had assaulted the victim. 
23It was further submitted that if Mr Jamal had legal representation on the District Court appeal, there was a prospect that better arguments would have been advanced as to the relevance of the 18-page bundle of documents which Mr Jamal unsuccessfully sought leave to tender as further evidence on the appeal.
Circumstances giving rise to first and second complaints
24The circumstances giving rise to Mr Jamal's complaints that he was not afforded the opportunity to be legally represented and was refused an adjournment on 1 June 2012 may conveniently be dealt with together.
25The issue of legal representation and the possibility of an adjournment of the appeal first arose on the hearing of the appeal on 23 March 2012.  This was in the context of Mr Jamal's application to tender fresh evidence on appeal.  After considering and ruling on the tender of a number of documents which were the subject of that application, Nicholson DCJ observed that it appeared that the time involved in completing that exercise seemed to be a couple of hours.  The transcript records the following response by Ms Kotsis for the Crown:
""KOTSIS:  Indeed, at best. Can I say this, your Honour: I have indicated to the appellant earlier that if he intended to or wished to get legal representation and sought an adjournment on that basis, I certainly wouldn't oppose it, and he seemed to be in two minds as to whether he was going to do that. That might affect an estimate on the next occasion. Obviously this process could all be done by way of an affidavit if that were to happen.
HIS HONOUR:  He's unrepresented at the moment.
KOTSIS:  Yes.
HIS HONOUR:  I'm making allowances for that.""
26Thus, the possibility of seeking an adjournment to obtain legal representation had already been brought to Mr Jamal's attention by the solicitor for the Crown on the first day of the hearing of the appeal.  No such application was made by Mr Jamal on that day.  It should also be noted that an interpreter was present on that day.
27When the hearing of the appeal resumed on 1 June 2012, Mr Jamal was again unrepresented.  He did not, however, have the assistance of an interpreter.  On this occasion, the issue of legal representation did not arise until near the very end of the hearing.  It was raised by Mr Jamal.  This occurred in the context of Nicholson DCJ having heard argument and ruled on the tender of further evidence from Mr Jamal (in respect of which leave was refused), and then adjourned for some time, apparently to read the papers.  On his return to court, Nicholson DCJ informed Mr Jamal that he was in a position to give a decision on the matter.  Before doing so, his Honour gave Mr Jamal the opportunity to raise any new matters that he wanted to address before giving his decision.  The transcript records the following exchange:
""HIS HONOUR:  ... I'm going to stop you. I've asked you several times if there's anything new you want to say. All that you've told me even in this last lot I think I have heard before. It's time now for me to make a decision.
APPELLANT:  I'm asking the Court to give me time, I bring solicitor because I'm not understand everything.
HIS HONOUR:  No.
APPELLANT:  I feel I'm not understand my case well, I am not professional, I am not understand English well. That's why I'm asking for another time to bring solicitor because is the police officer he fight with me with the legal aid and he withdraw my solicitor.
HIS HONOUR:  This is your second appearance before me and I begged you to get a solicitor on the last occasion because--
APPELLANT:  I have no money.
HIS HONOUR:  And you'll have no money next time - because I was concerned about your capacity to represent yourself in this Court notwithstanding your training in your own country. I really cannot see that a solicitor can pick up any matter that you have canvassed and develop it to such a point that it would change the position that I'm currently in and at the end of the day the question really is this, is there any reasonable basis for adjourning it and frankly I can't see it. In those circumstances I am going to give a judgment.""
28Ms Kotsis for the Crown then informed the Court that at the conclusion of the hearing on 23 March 2012, she had urged Mr Jamal to obtain legal representation.  He had not done so.  Mr Jamal told his Honour that he had a letter from the Law Society advising him to ask the Court for time, ""two, three weeks"".  His Honour replied that Mr Jamal should have shown him the letter at the beginning of the hearing on 1 June 2012, and Mr Jamal said he would go home and bring the letter to Court.  Nicholson DCJ refused the request for an adjournment:
""HIS HONOUR:  No, but the point I just made would still hold which is that I just don't feel that any solicitor in what I have seen of the matter and the material you've put before me could find anything to salvage for you with fresh evidence or without it--
APPELLANT:  It's the whole charge is not legally to coming before a court as the magistrate is not - as a direction as a magistrate she is acceptable, files document to pass the witness before here.
 ... 
That's why I am talking with you her now, give me a chance I'll bring a solicitor because I'm not understand what I do exactly, but I am believe I am not guilty, I don't believe that's what happened at all. That is true.
 ... 
She say I am assault her in eyes and shoulder. Her eyes she say I going to doctor. She didn't even bring any reference and she told the doctor I went to doctor after I heal from everything. So what, why she's going to doctor?
HIS HONOUR:  Thank you, we've been there. Would you sit down?
APPELLANT:  I'm sorry, sir, I need solicitor.
HIS HONOUR:  Would you sit down, please?""
29Nicholson DCJ then proceeded to give his judgment on the appeal on conviction, dismissing the appeal.
Circumstances giving rise to the third complaint
30The third complaint relates to the absence of an interpreter to assist Mr Jamal on 1 June 2012.  An interpreter was available and had assisted Mr Jamal on the first day of the hearing of the appeal on 23 March 2012.  An interpreter had also been available and provided assistance during the hearing of the Local Court criminal proceedings on 10 November 2011.
31Counsel for Mr Jamal drew attention to a comment by Nicholson DCJ on the first day of the hearing on 23 March 2012, that his Honour was having difficulty understanding Mr Jamal because of his accent, as indicative of a language barrier.  On that occasion, Mr Jamal had the assistance of an interpreter.  The transcript reveals the context of his Honour's comment (Tcpt 4, lines 29-30).  This was that, notwithstanding the presence of an interpreter, Mr Jamal was conducting his appeal largely without the assistance of the interpreter.  His Honour observed that his difficulty in understanding Mr Jamal was largely a product of Mr Jamal speaking too quickly and that he would be better served using the interpreter who was present on that occasion.  Notwithstanding this suggestion, the transcript records that only some use was made of the interpreter by Mr Jamal on 23 March 2012 and that otherwise Mr Jamal communicated with the Court without the interpreter's assistance on that day.
32Counsel for Mr Jamal next referred to the following passage of the transcript partway through the hearing on 1 June 2012, as again indicative of a language barrier:
""APPELLANT:  Next one, we can go into transcript straight away.  The reason for--
HIS HONOUR:  I have difficulty with your accent.
APPELLANT:  Beg your pardon?
HIS HONOUR:  I'm having some difficulty with your accent.  Just speak a little slower.
APPELLANT:  You ordered an interpreter for me but he didn't come, sorry about that.
KOTSIS:  I don't know that anyone's called the interpreter.""
33Earlier during the hearing on 1 June 2012, when Ms Kotsis for the Crown was addressing the Court, Mr Jamal requested:
""Could you speak slowly, because I not understand English very well.""
34Later, towards the end of the hearing on 1 June 2012, Mr Jamal stated on a number of occasions that he did not ""understand well"".  These exchanges between Mr Jamal and Nicholson DCJ occurred after his Honour had informed Mr Jamal that he was in a position to give his decision on the appeal.  One such exchange was as follows:
""HIS HONOUR:  Most of this, if not all of it, I have heard from you before on the last occasion.  I think quite a lot of it I've heard from you today.  Is there anything new that you want to say before I ask you to sit down?
APPELLANT:  I am aware from court decision because my English is not well and I'm not understand well--
HIS HONOUR:  All of that I know.  Now is there anything new you want to say?
APPELLANT:  I find all document and I brought a statement before the Court.
HIS HONOUR:  You had time to find the documents and you have found what documents you've found and they have no value to me.  Is there anything else you want to say?
APPELLANT:  No sir, but the Court it didn't allow to me to seize a subpoena because it's the police officer who when he arrested me he is not in charge in his duty.""
Circumstances giving rise to fourth complaint
35The first day of the hearing of the appeal on 23 March 2012 was largely devoted to Mr Jamal's application to tender further evidence.  The application was opposed by the Crown on the grounds of relevance.  Nicholson DCJ allowed some of the evidence and rejected other pieces of evidence that Mr Jamal sought to tender.  
36At the conclusion of the hearing on that day, Nicholson DCJ indicated to Mr Jamal that he should provide the Crown with any further documents that he intended to rely on.  This did not occur until the morning of the adjourned hearing on 1 June 2012, when Mr Jamal provided the Crown with an 18-page bundle of documents which he then sought to tender as further evidence on the appeal.
37It appears from the transcript of 1 June 2012, that the 18-page bundle of documents was handed up to Nicholson DCJ on that day.  The Crown objected to the tender on the grounds of relevance.  Nicholson DCJ explained to Mr Jamal that the further evidence needed to be relevant to the assault.  The transcript records the following exchange
""HIS HONOUR:  The task before the Court is this that there was an allegation which was determined by the Magistrate that on 1 June in 2006 in circumstances that the Magistrate heard you had assaulted your wife.  So the evidence that the Court has got to be interested in is evidence that relates to the 1 June 2006 assault.  Now if I look at the material that you are putting before me it talks about 2011, 2008, 2007.  It can have no relevance to 1 June 2006.  All of the material that you want leave to put in must be material that relates to 1 June 2006, and the events that were said to have occurred on that day, do you understand that?
APPELLANT:  I'm understand that issue.
...
 HIS HONOUR:  Now that's not a matter that you can discuss with me.  That is the material I need to focus on and if you've got a smiling wife in 2001, or 2007 or 2003, I don't want to know about it.  It has nothing to do with what happened on 1 June 2006.
APPELLANT:  Correct.
HIS HONOUR:  Okay.
APPELLANT:  Okay.""
38After some debate as to the relevance of the bundle of documents, his Honour refused leave to introduce the document.  
Procedural fairness
39The obligation of procedural fairness is concerned with providing a person whose rights are potentially affected in a matter with the opportunity to deal with relevant issues.  However, a party's failure to make proper use of that opportunity cannot be used to support the claim of procedural unfairness: Victims Compensation Fund Corporation v Nguyen [2001] NSWCA 264; (2001) 52 NSWLR 213 at 219 [37] per Mason P. 
40Guidance as to what is meant by procedural fairness is given by Allsop P in Jeray v Blue Mountains City Council (No 2) [2010] NSWCA 367; (2010) 180 LGERA 1 at [6] as follows: 
""At the root of procedural fairness is the provision of a fair hearing to a litigant and the basal notion that the litigant has understood the proceedings before him or her and has had an adequate opportunity given to him or her, considering his or her attributes, qualities and deficiencies which render the litigant more or less able to vindicate his or her rights in court. A sharp line between rules and consequences cannot be drawn in this respect. Analogies of the rules of the game and how the game is played may be helpful at one level, but ultimately each circumstance has to be analysed and evaluated to see whether, in a human context, a fair hearing has been provided.""
41In respect of litigants in person further considerations arise.  As Allsop P observed in Jeray at [10]-[12], litigants in person suffer the dual strain of being both litigant and advocate.  The balance required of a judge when dealing with a litigant in person is no simple task.  What is required of a judge to afford the parties a fair hearing is a matter about which minds can differ. 
Assistance to an unrepresented litigant
42The principles applicable to the Court's duty to unrepresented litigants in criminal proceedings are to be found in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 and MacPherson v The Queen [1981] HCA 46; (1981) 147 CLR 512.  In Dietrich's case, Mason CJ and McHugh J noted at 396 that Australian law did not recognise that an indigent accused on trial for a serious criminal offence has a right to the provision of counsel at public expense.  Their Honours went on to observe:
""Instead, Australian law acknowledges that an accused has the right to a fair trial and that, depending on all the circumstances of the particular case, lack of representation may mean that an accused is unable to receive, or did not receive, a fair trial.  Such a finding is, however, inextricably linked to the facts of the case and the background of the accused.""
43There is no absolute right to legal representation even where livelihood is at stake.  However, as observed in Cains v Jenkins (1979) 28 ALR 219 at 230 per Sweeney and St John JJ:
""But that is not to say that in all cases a tribunal can refuse it with impunity.  The seriousness of the matter and the complexity of the issues, factual or legal may be such that refusal would offend natural justice principles.""
44In MacPherson's case, the High Court held that a trial judge is obliged to give the accused advice concerning his right to a voire dire.  This was a consequence of the obligation of the trial judge to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly and in accordance with the law.  In MacPherson, Mason J remarked (at 534) that if the accused is allowed to remain in ignorance of a fundamental procedure, it can hardly be said that he or she has had a fair trial.  Furthermore, Brennan J said (at 546):
""If ... an unrepresented accused is kept in ignorance of the rules, procedural rules which are designed to protect an accused and so ensure a fair trial become a trap ... ."" 
45However, a very clear distinction was drawn in MacPherson's case between advising an unrepresented accused what his or her rights were in relation to various matters and advising the accused how he or she should exercise those rights: MacPherson at 524 per Gibbs CJ and Wilson J, at 534 per Mason J, at 537 per Aickin J and at 546 per Brennan J.
46Many of the cases dealing with the obligation of the Court to assist an unrepresented litigant are, in the main, concerned with assistance of an accused person.  However, a court must also have regard to the capacity of a person to effectively represent his or her interests.  This arises from the authorities dealing with the principles of procedural fairness and the right to representation.  Relevant matters will include the person's familiarity with relevant rules and complexity of those rules, language difficulties and similar matters.  The seriousness of the issue and any qualification which may place an opponent at an advantage will also be considered: Htut v Knowles [2010] WASC 84 at [49] per Hasluck J.
Assessment of the complaints
47Before addressing Mr Jamal's specific complaints, it is appropriate to say something about Mr Jamal, the nature of the case, and his intelligence and understanding of the case.
48First, as to Mr Jamal, the evidence before Nicholson DCJ revealed that he was a legally qualified practitioner in Egypt before coming to Australia.  Although prone to speaking very quickly, the transcript of proceedings before the Local Court and in the District Court, indicates that Mr Jamal had a reasonable command of the English language.  On the occasions when an interpreter was present, Mr Jamal made infrequent use of the interpreter.
49Secondly, the nature of a conviction appeal is different to a trial (either before a judge alone or a jury).  A conviction appeal is a rehearing on the evidence before the Local Court, together with any fresh evidence that the District Court may admit subject to leave, only if it is satisfied that it is in the interest of justice that such fresh evidence be given: s 18 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act; Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244; (2006) 164 A Crim R 39 per Mason P (Kirby and Hoeben JJ agreeing) at [17]-[22], [24].  The applicant on the conviction appeal has the onus to satisfy the District Court why such evidence should be permitted.
50In the present case, the material before Nicholson DCJ comprised the transcript of the Local Court proceedings on 10 November 2011, and the two exhibits before the magistrate; being a report from Dr Tanya Singh (who became the victim's doctor in 2005 and was her doctor during the period when the assault was alleged to have occurred), and Dr Singh's notes for the period 28 July 2006 to 19 February 2007.  Dr Singh gave an expert witness statement which included that the victim had told her several times about verbal and physical abuse from the applicant, but would not allow Dr Singh to document the injuries in her records.  This was because the victim feared Mr Jamal would find out and it would be worse for her and her children.
51Thirdly, as to Mr Jamal's intelligence and understanding of the case, no submissions were advanced on appeal that he was lacking in intelligence, or unable to understand the nature of the proceedings the subject of the conviction appeal.  This is unsurprising in view of Mr Jamal's Egyptian legal qualifications.  Rather, the submission was made that Mr Jamal was out of his depth in representing himself and in attempting to persuade the Court to accept fresh evidence on the appeal.  However, as noted above at [23], counsel for Mr Jamal did not put this submission any higher than that there was a prospect that, if legally represented, better arguments would have been advanced in support of this application to tender further evidence.
Refusal of adjournment and legal representation
52The decision of Nicholson DCJ to refuse the adjournment application was discretionary.  The grounds upon which such decisions may be challenged on an appeal (which is not the present application) are confined to those identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.  Thus on an appeal, it would have been necessary to show that the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or has failed to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or has made a mistake as to the facts.  Even if the precise nature of the error may not be discoverable, it is sufficient that the result was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise that discretion.  If the appellate court is satisfied that there has been an injustice to one of the parties as a result of the judge's exercise of discretion, it is under a duty to review the order made: R v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290.
53Counsel for Mr Jamal contended that the refusal of an adjournment was a denial of procedural fairness, because Mr Jamal was not given a reasonable chance to present his case on appeal to the District Court with legal representation.
54It may be accepted that it is basic to the rules of procedural fairness that an accused must be given a reasonable chance to present his or her case, which necessarily includes a reasonable opportunity to prepare that case before being called upon to present it.  The appearance that justice has been done is particularly important in a criminal trial, but nonetheless some limitation is required to be placed upon the right of an accused to delay his or her trial in order to prepare his case: R v Alexandroaia at 289.  
55The same observation may be made in relation to an adjournment to obtain legal representation.  There is no general test however, as to where the line should be drawn in every case involving an adjournment application: ""each case must really depend upon its own circumstances"": R v Alexandroaia at 289.  
56It is clear from the transcript of 1 June 2012, that in rejecting the adjournment application, Nicholson DCJ attached primary significance to the timing and context of the application, the utility of an adjournment and the unlikelihood that a legal representative could meaningfully assist Mr Jamal with his submissions based on his Honour's assessment of the transcript and exhibits from the Local Court.  In this regard, the following observations can be made.
57First, as to timing and context of the application, the nature of a conviction appeal was a significant factor for his Honour to take into account in refusing the adjournment.  Having earlier refused the application to admit further evidence, his Honour was required to determine the appeal based on the evidence from the Local Court, where Mr Jamal was represented.  In those circumstances, an adjournment to obtain legal representation was not as significant as it may have been in a different circumstance, such as if it was an application by an unrepresented person prior to a trial by jury.  His Honour was entitled to take into account in refusing to grant the adjournment to seek legal representation, that the evidence on which the appeal was to be determined involved a hearing in the Local Court where Mr Jamal was legally represented when the actual evidence against him was called, and his counsel in the Local Court had an opportunity to cross-examine the victim and make submissions on his behalf.  
58Secondly, Nicholson DCJ was entitled to regard the application as being significantly late in the proceedings and this was a relevant factor in refusing the application.
59Thirdly, Nicholson DCJ was entitled to take into account the utility of any adjournment application being granted.  In this regard, Mr Jamal had not taken any steps to obtain legal representation after the first day of the hearing on 23 March 2012, other than apparently speaking with the Law Society shortly before the date of the adjourned hearing.  He told Nicholson DCJ on 1 June 2012 that he could not afford legal representation.  No complaint is made to this Court concerning his Honour's observation that it was unlikely that an adjournment would result in Mr Jamal ever being able to fund a legal representative.  It is also relevant that Mr Jamal did not seek an adjournment at the beginning of the adjourned hearing on 1 June 2012, as apparently suggested in the letter from the Law Society.  He freely chose to continue to represent himself on that day.  He only sought an adjournment near the end of the hearing of his appeal, after his application to tender further evidence had been unsuccessful and his Honour was about to give his decision on the appeal.
60Fourthly, Nicholson DCJ was entitled to take the view that any legal representative could not meaningfully assist Mr Jamal with his submissions, based on his Honour's assessment of the transcript from the Local Court.  
61The only submission advanced by counsel for Mr Jamal, in this Court was the possibility that a legal representative could have advanced better arguments in support of the application to tender further evidence.  This turns on whether the further evidence was relevant and the sufficiency of any explanation for why it had not been sought to be tendered in the Local Court, when Mr Jamal was legally represented.  For the reasons given below, there is no merit in relation to the complaint concerning the rejection of the further evidence on appeal.
62In my view, no error has been shown in Nicholson DCJ's exercise of discretion to refuse the adjournment application.  Furthermore, there is no substance in Mr Jamal's complaint that the refusal of the adjournment application involved a denial of procedural fairness.  No injustice has been demonstrated in this regard.  
Refusal to allow an interpreter
63The transcript of 1 June 2012 does not record any specific application by Mr Jamal for an interpreter.  However, Mr Jamal appears to have believed that Nicholson DCJ had made a request for an interpreter to be available on that date.  
64In these circumstances, Mr Jamal's complaint should be viewed as a failure to ensure a fair hearing because Mr Jamal could not comprehend what was taking place.
65In my view, there is no substance in such complaint.
66First, an examination of the transcript in the Local Court proceedings and the District Court appeal (on 23 March 2012) reveals that when the interpreter was present, there were only infrequent occasions where he was used to interpret what was being said by the Court or the legal representative for the prosecution or during examination in chief and cross-examination of Mr Jamal in the Local Court.  When the interpreter was used, this was often at the request of the magistrate in the Local Court proceedings and Nicholson DCJ in the District Court appeal on 23 March 2012.
67Secondly, although the transcript records occasions on both 23 March 2012 (when an interpreter was present) and on 1 June 2012 (when there was no interpreter) where either Mr Jamal made requests that the speaker slow down, or Nicholson DCJ made comments that he had not understood what Mr Jamal had said, it is apparent that his Honour ensured that time was given for further explanation by way of clarification for the benefit of Mr Jamal.  
68Thirdly, it would appear from the transcripts of 23 March and 1 June 2012 that Mr Jamal had a reasonable command of the English language.  
69Fourthly, when making his application for an adjournment towards the very end of the hearing on 1 June 2012, Mr Jamal advanced this application on the need for legal representation, not the lack of an interpreter.  That is, he did not suggest that he did not understand what was occurring.  
70Mr Jamal's request for an adjournment to obtain legal representation was undoubtedly promoted by his recognition that Nicholson DCJ was about to deliver his decision on the appeal, in circumstances where Mr Jamal's application to tender further evidence had been unsuccessful.  Mr Jamal sought the adjournment to obtain a further opportunity to renew his application to tender further evidence. His Honour was not bound to afford Mr Jamal a further opportunity to apply to tender further evidence on the appeal.
71Fifthly, although Mr Jamal raised with Nicholson DCJ his belief that his Honour had made a request for an interpreter for 1 June 2012, procedural fairness did not necessarily require that an interpreter be made available on that day, or alternatively the hearing be further adjourned.  
72His Honour was entitled to take into account his own observations of Mr Jamal's command of the English language both on that date, and on the prior hearing on 23 March 2012 where Mr Jamal had made limited use of the interpreter, and from his review of the transcript of the Local Court, when Mr Jamal had similarly made limited use of the interpreter.
73This complaint should be rejected.
Further evidence application
74Mr Jamal's complaint relates to the rejection by Nicholson DCJ of the tender of the 18 page bundle of documents on 1 June 2012.  
75The material which Mr Jamal unsuccessfully attempted to tender was directed to the absence of any complaint by the victim during a five year period, notwithstanding what was submitted by Mr Jamal to have been the opportunity for complaint to have been made to various organisations which the victim had contact with.  
76Counsel for Mr Jamal did not complain about the sufficiency of the explanation given by Nicholson DCJ to Mr Jamal, concerning the requirement that further evidence relate to the assault.
77Nor did counsel for Mr Jamal suggest that there was any error in the way in which the judge dealt with the application to adduce further evidence.  He accepted that the documents were presented to Nicholson DCJ, and after consideration the judge ruled on the application adversely to Mr Jamal.  
78Rather, counsel for Mr Jamal submitted that if Mr Jamal had legal representation at the time of the appeal, there was a prospect that better arguments would have been advanced as to the relevance of these documents.  Such ""better"" arguments were not identified in the course of counsel's submissions.  
79There is no substance to this complaint.  Mr Jamal was not denied procedural fairness in the way in which Nicholson DCJ dealt with the application to tender further evidence.
Orders
80In my view, Mr Jamal's complaint that he was denied procedural fairness on the hearing of the District Court appeal is not made out.  His application for review should be dismissed with costs.
Sentence
81There is one further matter which needs to be addressed.  This concerns s 69C and s 69D of the Supreme Court Act, both of which, by virtue of s 69C(1), apply to proceedings in the Supreme Court for judicial review of a determination made by the District Court in appeal proceedings relating to a conviction or order made by the Local Court or a sentence imposed by the Local Court.  The present proceedings meet that description.  
82The sentence imposed on Mr Jamal by the Local Court and confirmed by the District Court of a conditional good behaviour bond for 12 months was stayed when the proceedings in this Court were commenced by summons filed on 29 June 2012: s 69C(2) Supreme Court Act.  
83In his written submissions filed before the hearing of the application, the Director of Public Prosecutions submitted that the Court should exercise its powers under s 69D(1)(b) of the Supreme Court Act to recommence Mr Jamal's sentence in respect of the good behaviour bond.  Section 69D provides:
""(1) The Supreme Court may order that a conviction, order or sentence that is the subject of proceedings, or any part of it: 
 (a) is to take effect on and from a day specified in the order, or 
(b) in the case of a sentence that has been served in part, is to recommence on and from a day specified in the order, being the day the order is made or an earlier day. 
(2) The order has effect even though a stay of execution may have been in force in respect of the sentence that is the subject of the proceedings.""
84After the conclusion of the hearing, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed amended written submissions drawing the Court's attention to the erroneous belief underlying his initial written submissions on the issue of sentence.  This was that Mr Jamal had in fact entered a bond on 10 November 2011 in accordance with the sentence imposed on that day at the Burwood Local Court following his conviction.  An affidavit of Helen Christine Langley sworn 22 October 2013, deposed that her recent inquiries of the District Court Registry at Parramatta and the Registry at Burwood Local Court revealed that neither court held a copy of a signed bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act entered by Mr Jamal.  
85In light of Mr Jamal's apparent failure to sign the bond as required by order of the Local Court made on 10 November 2011, the Director of Public Prosecutions now seeks an order that the proceedings be remitted to the District Court for Mr Jamal to be dealt with under s 97 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Section 97 provides:
""If:(a)  a court makes an order that provides for an offender to enter into a good behaviour bond, and(b)  the offender fails to enter into such a bond in accordance with the order,the court may sentence the offender, or convict and sentence the offender, as if the order had not been made.""
86It is not appropriate for the Court to remit the proceedings as requested by the Director of Public Prosecutions, without first affording Mr Jamal an opportunity to address this issue.  The directions which I propose should be made will afford Mr Jamal that opportunity.  I would propose that the question of remittal of the proceedings to the District Court be dealt with on the papers.  
Conclusion
87The orders that I propose are:
(1)Order that the third amended summons filed 22 January 2013 and the further amended summons filed 9 September 2013 be dismissed.
(2)Order that the applicant pay the costs of the Director of Public Prosecutions of the proceedings in this Court.
(3)Direct the applicant to file and serve short written submissions by 8 November 2013 on the issue of whether the proceedings should be remitted to the District Court for him to be dealt with under s 97 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
(4)Note that the Court will deal with the issue of remittal of the proceedings to the District Court on the papers.
88LATHAM J:  I agree with Gleeson JA.

1GLEESON JA: I agree with Adamson J.

2R A HULME J: I agree with Adamson J.

3ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Finnane on 10 October 2008 in the District Court at Sydney. 

4The applicant pleaded guilty on 23 July 2007 to three counts on an indictment containing six counts, each involving sexual offences against the one victim on two separate occasions. The Crown accepted those pleas in full satisfaction of the indictment. He also asked that a further matter on a Form 1 be taken into account.

5The applicant later applied to reverse the pleas. Hosking DCJ refused his application on 30 June 2008.

6The applicant was sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment by Finnane DCJ on 10 October 2008:
 





Count

10 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years to date from 28 March 2006 (date of arrest) and to expire on 27 March 2012
 
7The effective sentence imposed was a total term of 10 years with a non-parole period of 8 years after allowance for a discount of 14% for the applicant's plea of guilty. 

8The applicant filed a notice of application for leave to appeal dated 16 October 2008 that was received by the Registry on 22 October 2008. It expired on 11 December 2009. The Registry received a further notice of application for leave to appeal dated 14 January 2010 on 4 February 2010. No application for extension of time has been made in respect of either of those applications. Accordingly the present application is out of time.

Facts

9An agreed statement of facts dated 23 July 2007 was tendered on sentence. It was signed by the applicant personally as well as by his counsel, Mr Rowe. It was summarised by the sentencing judge and can be further summarised here. 

10The applicant operated a business called 'Children's Fun time Promotions' which included selling toys and novelty items for children, making balloon sculptures and conducting face painting at shopping centres, children's parties, fairs and christenings. The victim, who was mildly intellectually delayed, was 16 at the time of Count 2 and 17 at the time of the remaining offences. She was introduced to the applicant by her uncle in 2004 and began working for the applicant soon afterwards. Her mother, with whom she was then living, stopped her from working with the applicant. In late September 2005, about six weeks before the offence in Count 2 was committed, the victim left home and moved into a refuge. 

11The applicant contacted the victim at the refuge and asked her to resume work with him on weekends. He arranged to meet her either at his unit at Enmore or elsewhere before they went to work together. He usually took her to dinner after work and paid her a daily wage of $50-$100. At times on weekends she would stay overnight. The refuge sought details from the applicant of the accommodation to be provided for her. He furnished such by fax. On two occasions she stayed with him at his unit for which he gave her the keys. He bought gifts for her, took her to restaurants and also to the zoo.
 
Count 2

12On Friday 7 October 2005 the victim returned to the applicant's unit after work. She was lying on her side smoking a cigarette. He lay on the bed behind her and put his two hands under her T-shirt and massaged her back. He put one hand under the front of her T-shirt and rubbed her chest and breasts under her bra. She told him to stop. He did not stop and instead told her, ""My one ambition in life is to have sex with you"". She said, ""There's no fuckin' way."" He responded,""/ will and there's nothing you can do about it'. When she replied ""I'll kill myself first', he told her, ""I'll fuck you till you go cold"". The victim got up and went outside. Later they went to work at another party after which he escorted her to the Formula One Hotel at St Peters where she stayed the night alone.

Count 4

13Every weekend in October and November 2005, the victim worked for the applicant. He gave her a piece of paper for her to sign and told her that she was his business partner. As a result, the victim felt compelled to continue to work for the applicant. On 17 November 2005 the applicant advised the refuge by fax of the victim's working arrangements and that he had booked her into a hotel because of the expected late finishing time for her work that day. The victim met the applicant in the morning in the city. Later that day they went to his unit and watched movies. The applicant gave the victim a pre-mixed drink that contained alcohol. They went out to dinner and on their way home he bought a bottle of bourbon. On their return the applicant refilled the victim's glass of bourbon and coke several times until she had drunk about 10 glasses, by which time she was intoxicated.

14The applicant produced a dildo or vibrator and rubbed it on her back. He removed her jeans and underwear and rubbed the device on the outside of her vagina. He rubbed her chest. He lubricated the device and inserted it into her vagina, which caused her pain. Although she repeatedly said ""Don't"" and ""Stop"", he ignored her and pushed the device in and out of her vagina for about half an hour. 

Count 6

15Immediately afterwards, he performed cunnilingus on her. She told him to ""Stop"" but he said, ""What, can't a man have a bit of pleasure in his life with a beautiful girl"". He continued for about an hour.

Form 1

16After the applicant stopped the conduct that comprised Count 6, they went for a walk together. The victim consumed more bourbon and coke. When they returned to the unit the victim began to dance. Initially she was fully clothed, but later she wore only her underwear. The applicant was naked and dancing. He rubbed his body against her and at one stage he grabbed her from behind and rubbed his erect penis against her buttocks. When she told him that she needed some sleep, he asked her whether she had thought about doing bucks' parties. She dressed and went to sleep on the bed. The applicant slept on the floor.

17The next weekend, the victim told the applicant that she would not be working for him again. On 22 November 2005 she complained to her carers at the refuge about the applicant. Shortly afterwards she told a friend who accompanied her the following day to a police station to report the applicant's conduct. When the police conducted a search of the applicant's unit they located the vibrator and a tube of lubricant cream. Testing of the tip of the vibrator indicated the presence of DNA that had the same profile as the victim's. This profile was expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion people in the general population. There was also a second contributor to the DNA found on the tip of the vibrator, which came from a male and was consistent with it originating from the applicant.

Remarks on sentence

18The sentencing judge, after reciting the applicant's subjective features, including his age and medical history referred to the applicant's prior convictions. 

Prior offending in 1993

19In 1993 the applicant pleaded guilty to five counts and was sentenced by Court DCJ. The first three counts were unlawfully administering a stupefying drug, Normison, to the victim with the intent to enable himself to commit an indictable offence, sexual intercourse without consent: s 38 of the Crimes Act. The last two counts were sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the alleged victim was under the age of 16: s 61J(2)(d) of the Crimes Act. The victims were two girls aged between 12 and 14 years. The offending conduct took place between December 1991 and May 1992. A further 27 offences of a similar nature (involving the same two girls and a third victim, a 15-year old girl) were taken into account. His Honour described the offences as ""a prolonged episode of bizarre, paedophilic activity"" at various locations and ""involved the presence of others, both adults and other juveniles, and the taking of scores of photographs effectively recording the depravity"". 

20Court DCJ sentenced the applicant to concurrent minimum terms of 6 years with additional terms of 5 years. He was eligible for release on 18 June 1998. The sentence imposed by Court DCJ expired in 2003, two years before the present offences were committed. His application for leave to appeal was granted and this Court dismissed the appeal: R v Stephens (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 November 1994, unreported).
 
Other prior offending not taken into account

21The applicant was convicted of carnal knowledge in 1982, for which he received a 12-month good behaviour bond in 1982. The sentencing judge did not take this matter into account since his Honour said that he proposed to treat the applicant as not having any relevant prior convictions apart from the matters dealt with in 1993.

Matters identified as important by the sentencing judge

22The three matters that Finnane DCJ identified as being particularly important to the sentencing discretion were:

(1)The applicant's age (60 at time of sentence, 57 at time of offences).

(2)The applicant's prior offending and that he had previously served a lengthy period for serious sexual offences against children.

(3)The mental disability of the victim whom the applicant groomed and made intoxicated so that she was unable to resist his advances.

Grounds of appeal

23Although there is no appeal against conviction, the applicant relied on a document entitled ""Grounds of Appeal"" in which grounds 1, 2 and 6 appear to challenge Hocking DCJ's refusal of the applicant's attempt to reverse his plea. Notwithstanding formal irregularities and non-compliance with time limits the Crown has addressed each of these grounds. I propose to do so too.
 
24The grounds, said to be grounds of appeal, are:

(1)I was not allowed to change my plea from guilty to not guilty.

(2)My lawyer Legal Aid convinced me that I would get 22 years and that I couldn't call any witnesses even as I had letters from them. Also that I could not stop my priors coming before any jury therefore I had no chance in court. When I changed my plea it was not allowed and the judge called the Legal Aid lawyer a person he had known many years and wouldn't say the things he said to me.

(3)No course certificates were entered even as I had done many, many courses some that would help me.

(4)No medical reports were given even as they explained a few things.

(5)I wanted to have statements of people to be given to the judge but wasn't allowed.

(6)I went to court for 3 years and many times and asked for a lawyer not appointed by Legal Aid.

25The applicant relied on 64 pages of material in support of his application that were paginated by the Registry.

Grounds 1, 2 and 6: unsuccessful attempt to reverse the plea of guilty

26As referred to above these grounds do not appear to relate to an application for leave to appeal against sentence. They would appear to be relevant, if at all, to an appeal against conviction. There is no such appeal. Nonetheless my reasons for rejecting these grounds are set out below since the Crown's submissions addressed them.

27The applicant was arrested on 28 March 2006. He entered a plea on 23 July 2007. The agreed statement of facts referred to above was tendered on that day. The matter was adjourned to 5 October 2007 for sentence. It was subsequently adjourned again to 16 November 2007 at the applicant's request, as he was unwell. When it came before the District Court on 29 February 2008, Mr Rowe, the applicant's then counsel, informed Sorby DCJ that his instructions and those of his instructing solicitor, Ms Tipper, had been terminated and that the applicant proposed to file a notice of motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.

28The application to withdraw the plea was heard by Hosking DCJ on 30 June 2008. Mr Crawford-Fish of counsel appeared for the applicant. He relied on an affidavit affirmed by the applicant on 3 April 2008. He gave evidence in chief and was cross-examined. Mr Rowe, his former counsel, swore an affidavit on 28 May 2008 which was read by the Crown. He was cross-examined. Ms Tipper, the applicant's former solicitor, swore an affidavit which was read by the Crown in opposition to the application for withdrawal. She was not required for cross-examination.

29Mr Rowe's affidavit annexed a series of documents, all of which, with the exception of the last, was signed by the applicant. The first, his written instructions dated 20 July 2007, set out in detail the advice he received from his legal advisers. The document concluded as follows:

I have carefully considered my position and listened to the advice I have received. I acknowledge that no pressure has been placed on me by my lawyers and that they have advised me that they will act on my instructions. They have also advised that they are prepared to commence the trial on Monday 23 July 2007.

I now instruct my lawyers that I wish them to approach the Crown Prosecutor and advise that I am prepared to plead guilty to Counts 4, 6 and 8 in the current indictment and that I am prepared to sign a Form 1 to have Count 10 on the current indictment taken into account at my sentence. Should the Crown Prosecutor receive approval for this arrangement I will enter pleas of guilty to Counts 4, 6 and 8 on the current Indictment and sign a Form 1 to have Count 10 on the current Indictment taken into account at my sentence.
 
30The other documents annexed were:

(1)The statement of agreed facts referred to above;

(2)A handwritten document setting out the applicant's instructions that certain documents be tendered at the sentence hearing;

(3)A document dated 2 February 2008 terminating his lawyers' (Mr Rowe and Ms Tipper's) instructions; and

(4)Mr Rowe's file note created from his note of what he had proposed to tell the applicant in conference on 2 February 2008 relating to his proposed application to withdraw his plea which he later converted into the file note following the conference on that date.

31In the reasons for refusing the application given on 30 June 2008, Hosking DCJ recorded that he did not believe what the applicant said and accepted the evidence of Mr Rowe and Ms Tipper. In conclusion his Honour said:

""I do not believe that the applicant agreed to enter pleas of guilty because he felt pressured into entering in them, it is clear to me that the applicant entered those pleas of guilty because he thought he was getting the best deal for himself in pleading to a lesser number of charges and much less serious charges in the face of what appears to be a very strong Crown case against him. Moreover in my view this whole application is not genuinely born of some genuine belief by the applicant that he is really not guilty of these charges or was improperly pressured into pleading guilty to them.""

32No error has been identified in Hosking DCJ's decision. The applicant was represented by experienced counsel, both prior to the plea of guilty, on the application for its withdrawal and on sentence. These grounds are rejected.

Ground 3: no course certificates were entered

33Mr Crawford-Fish tendered a series of certificates, 32 in total, at the sentence hearing that showed courses that the applicant had undertaken while in custody, including courses in numeracy, mathematics, reading and writing for various purposes including debate and self-expression. A testimonial of Rev. Drury dated 13 September 2007 stated that:

I am told by the Crossroad Bible Institute people that he has completed so many courses that he is now doing Tier Three which is college entrance level.

34Mr Crawford-Fish submitted on his behalf at the sentence hearing:

""He is attending church courses as the certificates demonstrate and he is doing all the studying that is available to him.""

35Accordingly, there is no substance in this ground.

Ground 4: no medical reports were given even as they explained a few things

36The report of Dr van Rooijen of a CT scan of the applicant's brain taken on 28 April 2006 was tendered at the sentence hearing on behalf of the applicant. The report concluded that there was no evidence of residual or recurrent meningioma. The report of Ms Collins, forensic psychologist, dated 24 September 2007 was also tendered at the sentence hearing on behalf of the applicant. Mr Crawford-Fish summarised the report in his submissions at the sentence hearing and informed the sentencing judge that in 1990 the applicant was admitted to Adelaide Hospital where he had a brain tumour removed and that on being discharged from hospital he immediately returned to work.

37The applicant relied on documents at pages 15-30 of his bundle. These documents comprised a CT scan dated 12 September 2006 as well as articles and extracts from the Internet relating to meningioma as well as the effects of Depo-Provera. These documents were not tendered at the sentence hearing.

38The principles for receiving new evidence were summarised by Howie AJ (Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J agreeing) in R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359. The additional material does not satisfy any of the tests for fresh evidence on appeal. Of principal importance is that it was not relevant, in light of the CT scan dated 28 April 2006 which was tendered at the sentence hearing. The later CT scan, dated 12 September 2006, recorded, under the heading ""Comparison Examination"":

The previous films are not available but comparison is made to the report from the prior CT dated 28/4/06.

. . .

There does not appear to be any change from the prior report.

Ground 5: I wanted to have statements of people to be given to the judge but wasn't allowed

39At pages 57-64 of the applicant's bundle of documents there are several testimonials bearing dates in 2006, that appear to have been prepared in contemplation of the trial as going to the applicant's good character. They were not tendered at the sentence hearing. None of the references refers to his acknowledgement of guilt for the offences to which he pleaded guilty or to the sexual offences committed by him in 1982 and 1993 against young girls.

40The advice that Mr Rowe gave the applicant about these references at the conference on 2 February 2008 was recorded in Mr Rowe's file note referred to above. Relevantly, Mr Rowe recorded:

I also pointed to the references he had from young people and their worth. I said that my previous advice was that they should not be used at trial because they would raise his character thereby allowing the Crown to raise his bad character. I again informed him that the Crown wanted all witnesses at the sentence hearing for cross-examination. I said that this was obviously because the references made no reference to his previous charges or his current charges. It was therefore likely that the Crown wanted to put his previous charges to them and his current charges to them, to see whether, in light of those facts, they were prepared to adhere to their original references.

41The first impediment to the ground being made out is that there is no basis for the suggestion that he was not ""allowed"" to tender the references by Mr Crawford-Fish. 

42Secondly, the tender of the references was inconsistent with the submissions put on his behalf at the sentence hearing to the effect that the applicant acknowledged that he had a problem and wanted to address it by active treatment in custody. Mr Crawford-Fish submitted:

""Ms Collins assesses his likelihood of re-offending as being moderate to high. Against that in my submission she reports that he does show some insight into his behaviour. He acknowledges that he has a problem. He's open to the receiving of help, he's not ever had any psychiatric or psychological help in the past and is open to it, he's wanting it. He's applied he instructs me to participate in the CUBIT programme but until he's sentenced and reclassified he's not eligible to participate in that programme.""

43Thirdly, the references had little or no weight because their authors were apparently unaware of the nature or extent of the applicant's offending.

Unspecified ground: that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive

44The Crown has provided to this Court submissions that deal with a putative ground that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, although the applicant has not in terms articulated such a ground.

45I do not see any basis for the suggestion either that the individual sentences were, or that the total sentence was, excessive. The antecedent criminal history of the offender was relevant to the sentence to be imposed: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477. The 14% discount for the plea of guilty must be regarded as the upper end of the available range since the utilitarian value of the plea was much diminished by its timing and the applicant's protracted, and groundless, attempts to withdraw it. The sentences for counts 4 and 6 were wholly concurrent. The matters on the Form 1, which were taken into account in the sentence for Count 4, led neither to the sentence for count 4 being greater than that for count 6, nor to any accumulation with count 6.

46No error either in the process of exercising the sentencing discretion or in the result has been identified.

Whether extension of time ought be granted

47For the reasons given above, there is no merit in any of the proposed grounds of appeal. Accordingly leave to appeal would have been refused if the application for leave had been brought within time. There is therefore no purpose in granting an extension of time for leave to appeal.

Proposed orders

48I propose the following order:

(1)Extension of time to file application for leave to appeal refused.

2762617,Saad v Jeffcoat [2013] NSWSC 1585,"Judgment
1This is an appeal against the decision of Truscott LCM to make a final order permitting the carrying out of a non-intimate forensic procedure upon the plaintiff in the form of a buccal swab.
2The plaintiff was the respondent to the application in the Local Court.  The defendant before me was the Prosecutor in the Local Court.  For ease of comprehension, except when I come to make orders, I shall refer to the parties as the Prosecutor and the respondent.
Overview
3The following statutory structure was not in dispute between the parties at the hearing.
4The appeal is brought pursuant to s 115A of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (""the Act"").  That provision permits appeals to this Court against the order under consideration.  The appeal is to be dealt with as if it were an appeal against a sentence imposed in summary proceedings in the Local Court (by way of Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986).  Sections 52(1) and 53(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provide that an appeal in such a case to this Court is as of right when founded on a question of law alone, or with leave when founded upon a question of fact or a question of mixed fact and law.
5The order was made pursuant to Part 4 of the Act.  Section 23 of the Act is relevantly as follows:
""23   Circumstances in which Magistrate or other authorised officer may order forensic procedure
An order may be made by a Magistrate under section 24, or by an authorised officer under section 32, for the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect if:
(a)  the suspect is not under arrest and has not consented to the forensic procedure.
...""
6For the purposes of that section it was accepted by the parties that the respondent was not under arrest, and had not consented to the forensic procedure.  It was alleged by the Prosecutor that he was a suspect as defined by the Act.
7A suspect is defined in s 3 of the Act as follows: 
""(a)  a person whom a police officer suspects on reasonable grounds has committed an offence,
(b)  a person charged with an offence,
(c)  a person who has been summoned to appear before a court in relation to an offence alleged to have been committed by the person."" (emphasis added)
8The Prosecutor alleged that the respondent fell within the definition in (a).
9As part of that assertion, the Prosecutor alleged that the respondent was a suspect of the offence of possession contained in s 7 of the Firearms Act 1996.  That provision is relevantly as follows:
""7   Offence of unauthorised possession or use of prohibited firearms or pistols
(1)  A person must not possess or use a prohibited firearm or pistol unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit.
Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years.
...""
10Section 4A of the Firearms Act is as follows: 
""4A   Meaning of ""possession"" of a firearm - proof of possession
(1)  Without restricting the meaning of the word possession, for the purposes of any proceedings under this Act, a firearm is taken to be in the possession of a person so long as it is in or on any premises owned, leased or occupied by, or in the care, control or management of, the person, unless the court is satisfied that:
(a)  the firearm was placed in or on, or brought into or on to, the premises by or on behalf of a person who was lawfully authorised by or under this Act to possess the firearm, or
(b)  the person did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the firearm was in or on the premises, or
(c)  on the evidence before it, the person was not in possession of the firearm.
(2)  In this section, premises means any place, vehicle, vessel or aircraft.""
11I shall come to the significance of s 4A of the Firearms Act later in this judgment.
12The pertinent parts of s 24 of the Act are as follows: 
""24   Final order for carrying out forensic procedure
(1)  A Magistrate may order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if satisfied on the balance of probabilities:
(a)  that the circumstances referred to in subsection (2) or (3) exist, and
(b)  that the carrying out of such a procedure is justified in all the circumstances.
...
(3)  In the case of a non-intimate forensic procedure:
(a)  there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence, and
(b)  there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a).
(4)  In determining whether or not the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances, the Magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect's physical integrity, having regard to the following:
(a)  the gravity of the alleged offence,
(b)  the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed,
(c)  the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence,
(d)  the age, cultural background and physical and mental health of the suspect, to the extent to which they are known,
(e)  in the case of a suspect who is a child or an incapable person, the best interests of the child or person,
(f)  such other practicable ways of obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence as are less intrusive,
(g)  such reasons as the suspect may have given for refusing to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure concerned,
(h)  in the case of a suspect who is in custody, the period for which the suspect has been in custody and the reasons for any delay in the making of an application for an order under this section,
(i)  such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant to the balancing of those interests."" 
13There was no dispute between the parties that, before making the order, the learned Magistrate had to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of four things. 
14First, that a police officer believed on reasonable grounds that the respondent had committed an offence. That was founded upon the definition of ""suspect"" in s 3, and the reference to ""suspect"" in s 24(3)(a) of the Act.
15Secondly, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent had committed the offence of possessing a prohibited firearm or pistol (by way of the combined operation of section 24(3)(a) of the Act and s 7 of the Firearms Act).
16Thirdly, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that ""the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect [had] committed the offence"" referred to above (s 24(3)(b) of the Act).
17Fourthly, ""that the carrying out of such a procedure [was] justified in all the circumstances"" (s 24(1)(b) of the Act), as informed by the factors in s 24(4).
18The fourth matter based upon the combined operation of ss 24(3)(b) and 24(4) does not form the foundation of any ground of appeal, and will not be discussed further.
Position in the Local Court
19It is appropriate now to state the factual matters and submissions upon which the application in the Local Court was determined.  Because there is no dispute about them, I shall quote from the judgment of her Honour in that regard.  I have altered references to the parties and others for ease of comprehension.
""11.  On 21 February [the Prosecutor] executed a search warrant upon premises occupied by the Saad family at an address in Bass Hill.  The purpose of the search warrant was to locate prohibited firearms.
12.  The police located a plastic bag containing 2 prohibited firearms secreted in the roof cavity within easy access or reach of the manhole.  One was a .44 calibre 'Colt' revolver and the other was a .25 calibre semi automatic pistol.  Each firearm was fully loaded.  Each firearm was accommodated inside a sock, the revolver in a 'mooks' brand sock and the pistol in a 'billabong' brand sock.  There was also a brown cloth, which contained 6 rounds of ammunition for the revolver and 3 rounds for the pistol.  The items were subjected to forensic examination.
13.  At the time the search warrant was executed the Respondent was spoken to at the premises.  He stated that he was an occupier at the premises, residing there from 'time to time'.
14.  In the house, a bedroom said to be 'near the man-hole' - there is no evidence about the layout of the premises - contained two beds, clothing and some expired drivers licences and paper work in the name of [the respondent].
15.  The result of the forensic examinations of the items included the left thumb and right ring fingerprints of Milad Saad (the Respondent's brother) being located on the manhole cover and the plastic bag containing the firearms.  Milad Saad's DNA was not identified on any of the other items.  He was arrested on 29 February and interviewed by the police.  He confirmed with police that he shared a room with his older brother [the respondent], he had no knowledge of the firearms and had never accessed the roof cavity of the premises.  He confirmed that the persons who live in the house are his mother and father, himself, his brother and sister.
16.  The admissibility of this evidence was not subject to any objection and appears not to be controversial though I note Justice Fullerton's comments in LK v Commissioner of Police [2011] NSWSC 458 (20 May 2011) in which she remarks (para 26) that the Act is governed by the rules of evidence of the Evidence Act 1995.  Accordingly, what Milad Saad says is probably inadmissible and for the purposes of this application I rely on [the respondent's] statement to police that he occupies the premises and resides there from 'time to time'.  As such, he has access to the roof cavity.
17.  A DNA profile of a male individual has been identified on the pistol.  A Certificate of Analysis is Exhibit 2.  It identifies that the pistol was swabbed on the trigger, slide and grip and magazine release and side plates.  A mixture of DNA originating from at least 2 individuals was recovered.  The major component is consistent with originating from an unknown male (individual 'A').  The minor component was too weak to determine the profile(s) of the individual contributors.
18.  [The Prosecutor] says that the profile of 'Individual' A' cannot be matched to the 'profiler system' as it does not match any offender on the data base.  [The respondent's] DNA is not on the database.  [The Prosecutor] says that Milad Saad has been excluded as a contributor to the profile of individual 'A'.
19.  In his Affidavit, [the Prosecutor] deposes 'the profile has been identified as originating from a male possibly a relative of Milad Saad'.  He was asked questions about this statement.  He says that an analyst at the laboratory gave him this information.  [The Prosecutor] was unable to elaborate upon why the analyst formed this view.
20.  [The Police Prosecutor] said from the Bar Table that he had contacted the laboratory and was advised that there would be no evidence to that effect from the analyst in this application because the laboratory did not concern itself with possibilities and that it would only provide Certificates of Analysis upon testing items and comparing samples.
21.  Though the evidence has a particularly compelling flavour, the term 'possibility' and the uncertainty of the familial link of a 'relative' (as opposed to a brother) particularly in light of the Respondent belonging to a particular ethnic population in Australia, the evidence is such that I could not determine that there is some connection between Milad Saad's DNA profile and that of Individual 'A' to say that it was of such significance to make [the respondent's] DNA more likely or even possible than any other DNA of the same ethnicity found on the pistol.
22.  The suggestion that the profile of Individual A might possibly be a relative to Milad Saad is highly speculative, cannot be substantiated, explained or tested and as such lacks probative value.
23.  This is particularly so when the results of other items is taken into account.  From the revolver the analyst recovered the DNA of at least 4 individuals, none of which a profile could be determined.  The 'mooks' sock had the DNA of at least 3 individuals, one profile being sufficient to establish the profile of a male (individual B) and likewise the brown cloth had the DNA of at least 3 individuals including that of individual 'B' and an individual 'C'.  The 'billabong' sock had the DNA of at least 3 individuals, the profiles of which could not be determined.
24.  Though I do not exclude the evidence as it was received without objection, I am unable to place any weight upon it in determining whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Respondent has committed an offence.
25.  [The solicitor for the respondent] submits the comparison of the Respondent's DNA would merely prove or disprove that he is a suspect.  That is, there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that the Respondent has committed the offence.  That is, the fact that he from time to time resides at his family's address and would have access to the man-hole, is insufficient to grounds to suspect him of being involved in the offence.
26.  [The solicitor for the respondent] cross-examined [the Prosecutor] on why the Respondent's father was not sought for a DNA profile, to which [The Prosecutor] replied that it was a process of elimination.  From that answer, I take it that the police do not differentiate between the Respondent and his father.  They are both male, they both have access to the manhole (and for [the Prosecutor's] purposes are both relatives of Milad).
27.  There is no evidence that suggests the Respondent has ever been suspected of handling any firearm or committing any offence relating to any firearm let alone the subject pistol.  The reasonable grounds to suspect the Respondent of possessing the firearm falls to the location of the firearm in a private house occupied by his family where he has access to the man-hole.  Because the result of the analysis has identified male DNA, there is no basis to found a conclusion that any females of the household are suspects.  It must be the Prosecution case that the Respondent jointly possesses the gun with his brother Milad.""
Grounds
20Three grounds were notified and relied upon at the hearing: 
""1.  The Magistrate erred in law by failing to apply the test required by Section 24(1) of the Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act 2000.
2.  The Learned Magistrate erred at Law in finding there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Plaintiff is a suspect for the purposes of the Crimes (Forensic Procedure) Act 2000.
3.  The Learned Magistrate erred at Law in finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Plaintiff has committed an offence.""
21I shall deal with each of them in turn, providing extracts from the judgment of her Honour to the extent necessary.  
Ground one
22It became clear at the hearing that this ground could be summarised as being an assertion that, in light of the fact that the learned Magistrate did not repeatedly use the phrase ""on the balance of probabilities"" when expressing the satisfaction of her Honour that various matters had been established, one should infer that her Honour applied the wrong test with regard to those matters.
23In particular, the submission of the respondent was that there was an inherent complexity in a judicial officer being required to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities (pursuant to the chapeaux of s 24(1) of the Act) that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a certain state of affairs exists (whether that be pursuant to s 3 of the Act, or pursuant to s 24(3)(a)).
24Emphasis was placed upon the proposition that, in determining whether to permit intrusions upon the persons of citizens, judicial officers must not only apply the correct statutory test but also clearly demonstrate that they have done so.
25It was also submitted that the insertion of the phrase ""balance of probabilities"" in s 24 well after the commencement of the original version of that section demonstrates that Parliament expects that magistrates will apply the test, and formulate their reasons with regard to it, with precision.
26The Prosecutor submitted in short that the learned Magistrate referred to the test explicitly and correctly at the beginning of the judgment of her Honour.  It was emphasised that the opening words of [8] of the judgment were ""Pursuant to s24 (1) a Magistrate may order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if satisfied on the balance of probabilities: ..."", after which the Magistrate referred to the tests in the section.  It was submitted that every subsequent reference to satisfaction about a particular matter in the judgment must be read as incorporating that initial and explicit statement of the applicable standard of proof with regard to the statutory tests.
Determination
27As can be seen from the quote in the immediately preceding paragraph, at the beginning of the judgment, her Honour explicitly referred to the applicable standard of proof immediately before outlining the relevant tests.
28Magistrates are not required ritually to repeat the standard of proof being applied throughout their judgments, whether they be reserved or ex tempore.
29I have no difficulty in reading every reference by her Honour to satisfaction about a particular fact or state of affairs as implicitly incorporating a reference to the requisite standard of proof, in light of its explicit enunciation at the start of the judgment.
30And I am certainly not satisfied that her Honour applied some different, or lesser, standard of proof to the various questions for determination in the Local Court.
31Finally, I reject the submission that there is anything particularly complex about s 24 of the Act, and that such complexity suggests that the learned Magistrate has failed to apply the appropriate standard of proof.   
32I respectfully reject ground one.
Ground two
33This ground focused upon the need for satisfaction on the balance of probabilities that the respondent was a ""suspect"", as defined by s 3, as part of the necessary satisfaction of the matters contained in s 24(3).
34It is apparent from the judgment that her Honour did not explicitly address this matter as a separate question.  However, it was made clear before me that the contention of the respondent is not that her Honour failed to consider the question.  Rather, the ground is founded upon the proposition that the learned Magistrate considered it, but could not have been satisfied that a police officer suspected that the respondent had committed an offence on reasonable grounds.
35To the extent that that contention could be characterised as in truth raising a question of mixed law and fact, the respondent sought leave to argue it.
36The respondent submitted that the oral evidence at first instance established that the Prosecutor had engaged in a ""process of elimination"" with regard to seeking DNA profiles from persons:
(1)who are male;
(2)who had some degree of access to the premises; and
(3)whose profile was not retained on the DNA database.
37It was submitted that such an indiscriminate approach was not consistent with a suspicion held on reasonable grounds.
38Having said that, the respondent accepted that it was not for the police officer to determine whether his own suspicion was held on reasonable grounds.  Rather, following through the interlocking sections, it was a matter for the evaluative judgment of the learned Magistrate as to whether such a suspicion was shown on the balance of probabilities to have been held on reasonable grounds.
39The respondent accepted that the analysis of the Magistrate with regard to the separate but related question of whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent had committed an offence (for the purposes of s 24(3)(a)) could be considered by me in determining whether this ground founded upon s 3 had been made out on the basis that it demonstrated a deficiency in analysis.  Detailed submissions were made criticising that analysis.  
40The Prosecutor agreed that the analysis of the question that founds ground 2 was subsumed in the analysis of the subsequent question pursuant to s 24(3)(a).
41He submitted that evidence sufficient to provide reasonable grounds for a suspicion will very often be less than that required to provide reasonable grounds for a belief.
42He submitted that a finding that there were reasonable grounds for a suspicion on the part of a police officer that the respondent had committed an offence was well open on the evidence, and that there was no error demonstrated, either in that finding or in the process of reasoning underlying it.
Determination
43With regard to the separate but related question to which I have referred, her Honour found as follows: 
""28.  In terms of 24(1)(a) I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Respondent is a suspect of joint possession of the firearms with his brother Milad for the following reasons:
(1)  The location of the firearm in a private dwelling where a family unit lives is such that it is likely that an occupant of the house, as opposed to a visitor or a stranger has dominion over them.
(2)  The Respondent is a member of that family unit and from time to time occupies the residence.  He has ready access to the premises.
(3)  The firearms were secreted in a manner and location to minimize the risk of identifying the persons exercising their dominion over the firearms, that is, consistent with protecting the occupants from being identified as being responsible for or in possession of the firearms.
(4)  There is an identifiable profile of a male on the pistol; such DNA is not on the police database and the Respondent's DNA is not on the police database.
(5)  There is multiple male DNA on the pistol and other items located indicating a total of at least 2 other identifiable individuals - there is no evidence whether that DNA has been run through the database, but [the Prosecutor] did say he suspected certain persons.  There are a total of at least 4 individuals who have handled one or both of the firearms or items found in the bag.
(6)  The Respondent and brother share a bedroom, if only from 'time-to-time'.
(7)  The Respondent's brother's fingerprints were on the manhole and plastic bag containing the firearms supporting a finding that at least one occupant of the residence is in possession of the firearms.  Due to the multiplicity of DNA it is likely that more than one male occupant is also in possession of them.""
44Although her Honour did not explicitly deal with the question of satisfaction that the respondent was a suspect as defined in s 3, I respectfully agree with the joint approach of the parties that that finding was implicitly encompassed in the reasoning of her Honour with regard to the question in s 24(3)(a).
45The combination of factors arising from the evidence and to which her Honour referred leads me to the view that it was well open for her Honour to find on the balance of probabilities that the suspicion of the Prosecutor that the respondent had committed an offence was held on reasonable grounds.  That is so for the following reasons.
46First, to the extent that the analysis of the respondent sought to have me consider each piece of inculpatory evidence individually, I respectfully reject that approach.  As with any circumstantial case, it is a matter of considering each undisputed or established fact in the context of all of the other such facts.
47Secondly, the question is whether it has been established that a suspicion (as opposed to a belief, a higher state of mind) is held on reasonable grounds (as opposed to being itself reasonable, perhaps a higher standard) on the balance of probabilities (as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt, unquestionably a much higher standard).  In short, the test is not particularly stringent.
48Thirdly, it is true that the sixth factor is a matter that her Honour had previously said would be disregarded, in light of the question about the admissibility of hearsay statements in applications for forensic procedures, and the applicability of the rules of evidence generally (see for example, L v Lyons; B and S v Lyons [2002] NSWSC 1199; (2002) 56 NSWLR 600 at [29] - [34] and LK v Commissioner of Police [2011] NSWSC 458 at [26]).  It may well be that reference to that factor in the judgment was through oversight.
49But even disregarding that factor, I consider that it was well open to the evaluative judgment of her Honour to find, on the evidence before the Local Court, that it had been established on the balance of probabilities that the suspicion of the police officer that the respondent had committed the offence contained in s 7 of the Firearms Act was held on reasonable grounds.
50I would grant leave to argue this ground.  But in my opinion, it is not made out.
Ground three
51The respondent sought leave to argue this ground.  It was framed in similar terms to ground two.
52It was submitted that the necessity of establishing that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent had committed an offence, pursuant to s 24(3)(a), was a higher test than merely finding that the suspicion of a police officer was held on reasonable grounds.
53Thereafter, the respondent embarked upon a detailed analysis of the seven factors relied upon by her Honour.
54With regard to the first factor, it was submitted that her Honour had confused ""possession"" with ""dominion"".  And it was submitted that her Honour should have noted that the firearms were secreted by way of a manhole above a room not connected with the respondent.  It was also submitted that the Magistrate should have had explicit regard to the fact that persons who did live continuously at the premises, or even visited frequently, could have placed the items there, without the slightest involvement of the respondent.
55With regard to the second factor, complaint was made that her Honour had referred to the respondent having had ""ready access to the premises"", when in fact the evidence was that the respondent had admitted to the Prosecutor that he ""resided at the premises from time to time"".
56With regard to the third factor, it was submitted that the learned Magistrate had engaged in circular reasoning, in the sense of assuming that the mode of secretion showed that it was an occupant who had adopted it.
57With regard to the fourth factor, it was submitted that the fact that one's DNA profile is not on the database used by the police can hardly be a matter of inculpation.
58With regard to the fifth factor, it was submitted that this material should not have been taken to account, in that it was evidence conveyed to the Court informally; that is, neither by way of evidence in the witness box nor by way of affidavit.
59With regard to the sixth factor, the respondent made the point (to which I have already referred) that her Honour had previously indicated that the hearsay assertion that the respondent and his brother shared a room would not be taken into account.  
60With regard to the seventh factor, it was submitted that, even if it be the case that the brother of the respondent was implicated by way of the scientific evidence connecting him with the manhole cover and the plastic bag, that did nothing to implicate the respondent.
61In short, it was said that it was an error for her Honour to determine that the test in s 24(3)(a) had been made out. 
62The Prosecutor submitted simply that satisfaction on the balance of probabilities that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent had committed the relevant offence was reasonably open to the evaluative judgment of her Honour on the evidence as a whole.
63Separately, he argued that the broadened definition and onus reversal with regard to the offence-creating provision in s 7 effected by s 4A of the Firearms Act made the submission of the respondent unsustainable.
Determination
64The submissions and analysis of the respondent would have somewhat greater force if the question were whether one could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the proposition that the respondent was guilty of the offence in question.  In saying that, I do not seek to bind any subsequent determination of that question in the slightest.  Rather, I merely seek to highlight the contrast between, on the one hand, proof of elements of an offence beyond reasonable doubt, and, on the other, proof on the balance of probabilities that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed an offence.  Self-evidently, the latter test is a much less rigorous one.
65I do not consider that it is a matter of me, in some de novo sense, substituting my own opinion for that of the learned Magistrate.  Rather, it is a matter, to the extent that the ground is based on a question of fact or mixed law and fact, of determining whether the finding of her Honour was reasonably open.  There is nothing to suggest that an appeal founded upon matters of fact pursuant to Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is to be determined de novo.  Furthermore, such an interpretation of that Act would be quite anomalous with regard to the overall structure of criminal appeals in this State.
66I see no error in the analysis of her Honour, save with regard to the sixth factor, to which I have previously referred.
67But leaving that factor entirely to one side, I consider that it was well open to her Honour to be satisfied of the necessary components of the statutory test. 
68I have come to that view without reliance on the submission of the Prosecutor with regard to s 4A of the Firearms Act.  I shall discuss that in a moment.
69It follows that I would not uphold ground three.
Notice of contention of Prosecutor and related submission
70At the hearing, and as against the possibility that the appeal otherwise succeeded, the Prosecutor sought to rely upon a notice of contention.  It was submitted that, even if error were established by the respondent, the order of the Magistrate could be maintained by way of s 4A of the Firearms Act.
71In a nutshell, the submission was that, although not relied upon by the Prosecutor at first instance, the findings underpinning grounds two and three could be amply justified, not only by the broadening of the offence effected by s 4A, but also by way of the onus reversal that that provision brings to offences under s 7.
72The respondent submitted that there would be procedural unfairness in me permitting such an argument to be made.  He submitted that, if the Prosecutor had run its case in that way at first instance, the respondent might well have conducted his case quite differently.  For example, if there had been any suggestion of an onus falling directly or indirectly upon the respondent, he might well have sought leave to give or call evidence, pursuant to s 30(6)(b) of the Act. 
73I consider that there is merit in that submission of the respondent.  Accordingly, I have determined the three grounds of appeal without reference to s 4A of the Firearms Act.  The result is that the question of how s 24 operates with regard to an offence that features an onus-reversing provision (such as s 7 of the Firearms Act, or the well-known deeming provision with regard to supplying a prohibited drug in s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985) will not be determined in this judgment. 
Costs
74There has been controversy in the past as to whether or not, in an appeal such as this, this Court has power to order costs against the losing party.  On the authority of ASIC v Sigalla (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 83, Ronowska v Kus (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 817 and ACP v Munro [2012] NSWSC 1510, I consider that I have the power to order costs.  And I consider that costs must follow the determination of the appeal.
Orders
75I make the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal with regard to grounds two and three granted.
(2)Appeal dismissed.
(3)The plaintiff, Mr Saad, is to pay the costs of the defendant, Detective Senior Constable Jeffcoat, of the appeal.

		31 October 2013",2013-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762621,Dang v R [2013] NSWCCA 246,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by Judge Solomon in the District Court on 15 June 2012. The charges to which he ultimately entered pleas of guilty fell into two groups being events occurring on two days separated by some 21 months. Each group involved offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 

2Before outlining the facts and the sentences, it is convenient to note that there are three matters which call for the consideration of this Court on the application, namely:

(1) that by both imposing longer sentences in respect of offences committed whilst the applicant was at large on conditional liberty and increasing the level of accumulation the sentencing judge imposed double punishment for the breach of conditional liberty;
(2) the finding of the trial judge that the manufacture of methylamphetamine on two occasions, for which he was convicted, did not involve ""any level of commerciality regarding the supply of the methylamphetamine"", and
(3) the relevance of his addiction to the drug which he was manufacturing for his own use.

3The need to address these considerations warrants a grant of leave to appeal with respect to the various sentences. 

Background

4The offences of which the applicant was convicted and the sentences imposed appear in the judgment of Latham J. Nevertheless, it is convenient to set them out, with some background explanation, in order to assess the various factors raised by the appeal.

5On 14 July 2009, in the course of manufacturing methylamphetamine, the applicant caused a fire in a unit in Surry Hills where he was then residing. The fire brigade and police went to the unit. The following day, the police searched a car registered in a name used by the applicant which contained a diary with a formula for manufacturing methylamphetamine (commonly known as ""ice"") and two four litre tins containing acetone, a chemical used for manufacturing the drug. 

6Count 2 on the indictment alleged possession of apparatus for the manufacture of a prohibited drug, whilst counts 3, 4 and 5 alleged possession of a precursor intended for the use and manufacture of a prohibited drug, all offences being referable to 14 July 2009. On each count, the applicant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two years to date from 19 December 2010. These were fixed terms to be served concurrently. 

7The applicant was also charged (count 1) with manufacturing methylamphetamine over a period extending from 19 May 2009 until 15 July 2009. The count in the indictment alleged manufacture of an amount being ""not less than the commercial quantity for such drug"". The period of two months was relied upon on the basis of the state of the premises when inspected by police on 15 July 2009, coupled with the fact that the premises had last been inspected by the real estate agent responsible for letting them on or about 19 May 2009. Although there were waste products found on the premises, the prosecution witness who had examined the waste products was unable to state when they had been produced. In the event, the trial judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that manufacture of a commercial quantity occurred within the period nominated. The trial judge, in a judgment dated 20 March 2012, noted that the estate agent who had carried out the inspection on 19 May recalled that the apartment was then ""in an untidy and dirty state"" and was not well looked after. Although there was no express finding in the judgment on sentence, the Director invited the Court to infer that being expressly satisfied as to all the other elements of the offence other than the relevant period, the trial judge must have been satisfied that an amount not less than the commercial quantity had in fact been manufactured. Nevertheless, the judge accepted a plea to the lesser offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug. That offence carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a fine. 

8The trial judge allowed a discount of 25% with respect to the sentence on the manufacturing charge on the basis that the applicant had previously proffered a plea of guilty to the alternative count prior to the trial. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years, with a balance of term of two years. The sentence was fixed to commence on 18 June 2011, being an accumulation of six months on the starting date of the two year fixed terms imposed for the other sentences. The balance of the term for the 2009 manufacturing offence was, in the event, immaterial as it was wholly within a subsequent non-parole period. 

9Following his arrest on 14 July 2009, the applicant remained in custody until 4 November 2009, a period of almost four months. He was entitled to credit for that period which was effected by backdating the sentences to commence four months prior to the date of his second arrest. 

10The second group of offences arose from a search executed on 11 April 2011 of a unit in Hurstville occupied by the applicant. He was engaged in a process of manufacturing methylamphetamine by reducing a precursor at the time that the police entered the apartment. Charges which became counts 8-10 on the indictment were laid in respect of the events of 11 April 2012. Counts 9 and 10 involved possession of precursors, namely red phosphorous and iodine, intended for the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Count 8 alleged manufacture of the drug, between 28 February and 12 April 2011, in an amount ""not less than the commercial quantity"", but a plea was accepted to the alternative offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug.

11Following the pattern of the earlier offences, the trial judge sentenced first for the two offences involving precursors, in each case imposing a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and three months. These terms were fixed to commence on 19 December 2011, thus being accumulated by six months on the sentence for the 2009 manufacturing offence. The result was that the applicant served a period of one year referable solely to the Surry Hills offences in 2009. 

12On count 8 (the second manufacturing offence), the trial judge fixed a non-parole period of three years and seven months, with a balance of term of two years and five months, giving an overall sentence period of six years. That sentence was fixed to commence on 19 May 2013 and thus was accumulated by a period of one year and five months on the sentences for the 2011 precursor offences.

Relationship of non-parole period and balance of term

13It is convenient to dispose first of the specific ground of appeal (ground 3) challenging the relationship between the balance of term for the final sentence imposed, when compared with the accumulated periods of mandatory custody. The balance of term was two years and five months (29 months) and the period of mandatory custody was six years (72 months). Absent a finding of special circumstances, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") requires that the balance of term of a sentence not exceed one-third of the non-parole period: s 44(2). Unhelpfully, but reflecting common practice, the submissions complained that ""the ratio between the non-parole period and the total term"" was decreased from 75% to 70.5%. (The figures are wrong in any event: the effective balance of term was 29 months, not 30, as appears to have been assumed.)

14The written submissions in support of this ground referred to (and set out in full) s 44(2B) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. This was based upon a misconception. Until an amendment to the Sentencing Procedure Act, which commenced on 14 March 2011, it was necessary to impose a sentence specific to each offence. With an accumulation of sentences, it is readily apparent that, if the balance of term on the final sentence is to approximate one-third of the total period of mandatory custody, it will need to constitute a much higher proportion of the final sentence. Thus it was (and remains) commonplace for a judge seeking to achieve a balance of term being at least one-third of the total period of mandatory custody to find special circumstances, even if only for that reason. 

15The 2011 amendment permitted a judge to avoid this problem by imposing an ""aggregate sentence of imprisonment"" in respect of two or more offences: s 44(2A). If that approach were adopted, the judge would be entitled to set a single non-parole period and the proportion between the balance of the term of the sentence and the non-parole period is not to exceed one-third unless the court finds special circumstances: s 44(2B). In the present case, Judge Solomon did not impose ""an aggregate sentence"": accordingly, s 44(2B) was irrelevant. It is also clear that the judge found special circumstances in part to overcome the potential disparity between the balance of term and the total of the accumulated periods of mandatory custody. The balance of the final sentence was in fact 67% of the non-parole period for that offence (well in excess of one-third). It is also clear from the interchange with counsel following the imposition of sentences, that he appreciated that the effect would not be to impose a balance of term which was significantly in excess of one-third of the total of the periods of mandatory custody.

16What was done was appropriate and the result intended. The third ground of appeal should be dismissed.

Manifest excess
(a) the grounds of appeal


17Grounds 1 and 2 asserted manifest excess of the individual sentences and the consequential overall term of imprisonment, thus complaining in part as to the degree of accumulation. 

18So far as the Surry Hills offences were concerned, the possession of apparatus for manufacturing a drug and various precursors were all fixed to run concurrently. There was no complaint about that. The sentence for manufacturing methylamphetamine was fixed to commence six months after the other Surry Hills offences; the next set of offences, relating to possession of precursors at Hurstville commenced six months after the Surry Hills manufacturing offence. Thus, the period of incarceration solely referable to the Surry Hills offences was 12 months. Whatever view is taken as to the appropriateness of the individual sentences, there is no basis for interfering with that aspect of the sentencing. No lesser period referable solely to the 2009 offences would be appropriate.

19The sentence for possession of two precursors at Hurstville (being a fixed term of two years and three months) ran for 17 months (concurrently with the Surry Hills offences) before the commencement of the second manufacturing offence. Thus, taken in isolation, the Hurstville offences gave rise to a period of mandatory custody of five years. If those sentences were excessive, the degree of accumulation might also be seen to be excessive. Indeed, the applicant argued that the increased sentences and the higher level of accumulation involved double punishment for the further offending.

(b) motives - addiction v financial gain 


20The primary basis for challenging the individual sentences was that the manufacture of drugs was primarily designed to feed an addiction which the applicant could not afford from his financial resources and, secondarily, to provide a source of drugs for his partner and friends. The moral culpability of that conduct was, it was submitted, quite different from that applicable in the case of manufacture for commercial profit. The authorities which support the level of sentences imposed on the applicant all involved commercial manufacture or possession of precursors or apparatus for commercial manufacturing purposes. Accordingly, it was submitted, the sentences imposed in the present case were excessive.

21In his careful reasons for judgment, the sentencing judge explicitly stated in respect of the 2009 manufacture, ""I do not find any level of commerciality regarding the supply of the methylamphetamine"" and, in respect of the 2011 manufacture, ""there is no evidence of commerciality in the supply of methylamphetamine"". These findings did not imply that the sole consumer of the drug was the applicant: the sentencing judge held that he supplied his girlfriend ""and others"", who were not identified as to relationship or number.

22In one sense, commerciality may best be seen as a surrogate for a more basic standard, namely the degree of harm to others, combined with an economic choice. The first element looks to objective consequences, the latter to factors personal to the offender. Addiction is a factor personal to the offender. It has been described as an explanation, but not a justification for, criminality: but that characterisation requires some degree of qualification. 

23First, the most detailed discussion in the authorities in this State is to be found in the guideline judgment of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [174]-[204] (Spigelman CJ), [215]-[277] (Wood CJ at CL, RS Hulme J agreeing) and [335]-[356] (Simpson J). The significance of addiction as a factor affecting the deterrent operation of a sentence may be different in a case of manufacturing a drug for private use, as compared with offences of armed robbery where the proceeds of crime are destined to feed the addiction.

24Secondly, if addiction is an explanation (in part) for criminal behaviour, it is necessary to identify why it is not ""in part"" an excuse, though not a justification. Thirdly, the distinction involves ideas of moral culpability, which invites a question as to the extent to which a sentencing court is required to assess levels of moral culpability.

25In this context, ""moral culpability"" engages two broad considerations, namely harm to others and freedom of the offender to choose another course. The law recognises the inappropriateness of convicting a person unable to distinguish right from wrong and, indeed, a person who is unable adequately to understand the process of a plea and trial. Further, even where the criminal law has run its course, the law recognises the relevance of mental illness in diminishing culpability for the purpose of assessing an appropriate sentence. But the distinction between mental illness and mental health is not a bright line, nor is the assessment of moral culpability based on freedom of choice transparent. One problem is that the assessment of a factor such as addiction to ""ice"" is largely beyond the capacity of the Court, at least on the evidence available on this case.

26Furthermore, ""moral culpability"" implies a choice between courses of conduct, some of which are criminal, others of which are not. The classification of that which is criminal and that which is not is a matter for the legislature and is not entirely dependent upon a calculus of harm to others, or even the cost of treatment, borne by the economy as a whole. It is also a matter for the legislature to indicate, by prescription of penalties, the seriousness of contravention.

27To conduct a criminal enterprise relating to prohibited drugs for profit is more reprehensible than pursuing personal satisfaction. Dealing with offences generally, the Sentencing Procedure Act treats it as an aggravating factor that ""the offence was committed for financial gain"": s 21A(2)(o). Thus manufacture for financial gain would have involved an aggravating factor which was present in other cases upon which reliance was placed by the prosecution, but not in this case. Further, although the sentencing judge accepted that those consuming the drug would extend beyond the applicant and his girlfriend, no figures or amounts were known. In those circumstances the Court must act on the basis that supply would be to a relatively small number, in small amounts.

28Within the parameters fixed by the legislature, the exercise of discretion by the court will reflect various purposes of the criminal law, including, perhaps primarily, general and personal deterrence. Punishment may involve an element of public retribution, although the role of the courts in that regard should be tempered so as to discriminate between expression of enduring values and the ill-considered emotive responses of the moment. Further, deterrence is not promoted by a sentence which is seen to be arbitrary, nor one which interferes with an expectation of rehabilitation. General deterrence is a large element of a condign punishment and will reflect a range of values. Drug use which causes limited harm to others should not attract as heavy a punishment as would actual supply to others. Where the legislature has determined that possession of a quantity from which supply may be inferred warrants a higher sentence, that factor becomes an element of the offence and care must be taken to avoid treating such matters as aggravating circumstances: Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [7]-[12], Bowden v R [2009] NSWCCA 45, AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 160 at [29]-[31] (Adams J). However, supply of drugs having addictive qualities to any other person may be treated as a serious offence, whether or not the supplier is motivated by financial gain. Manufacture is an essential prerequisite to both use and supply. The extent of the manufacturing operation, and hence the ultimate quantity of product for consumption is an important consideration.

29Even in respect of those who traffic in drugs a distinction is drawn between categories. As explained by Wood CJ at CL in R v Day (1998) 100 A Crim R 275 at 277, ""The objective criminality of an offender who traffics in drugs to feed personal habit is somewhat less than that of a trafficker for greed..."".

30The circumstance of addiction is also accepted as potentially relevant to moral culpability. A person in the grip of an addiction has less freedom of choice than would otherwise be the case. Moral culpability is a function of perceived freedom of choice. In Cicciarello v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 272 Allsop P, Fullerton and McCallum JJ noted at [15] that in Bowden at [55]-[60] ""a distinction was drawn between selling drugs for commercial gain and for feeding a habit."" The reasons continued at [17]:

Whilst one should be careful about generalising in relation to such factors outside the circumstances of any particular case, here, quite clearly, when one understands the background of this young man and what he was doing, he was not selling for greed or for financial gain, he was selling to feed a drug habit that he had acquired. This does not detract from the fact that he committed a serious offence, but what it does mean is that it was an error, and an important one, to characterise this as selling for financial gain and thus to characterise it as an offence falling within the mid-range.

(c) other factors


31Two other factors, adverse to the applicant, should be noted. First, the carrying out of drug manufacture in a residential apartment, with attendant risks of fire (which materialised in the Surry Hills apartment) and creation of obnoxious fumes (which occurred at Hurstville), being features of the manufacturing process, indicate the seriousness of the conduct.

32Secondly, the 2011 offences at Hurstville were undertaken whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty in respect of the first offences, which is an established factor of aggravation: s 21A(2)(j). In this context, it is convenient to deal with the first point noted at [2] above, namely that the applicant was punished twice for his breach of the conditions on which he had been released in 2009. The complaint that the sentences imposed for the 2011 offences were excessive will be addressed below: however, there is no basis for concluding that the sentences were disproportionately high when compared with the sentences for the 2009 offences. So far as accumulation was concerned, the first sentence commenced only 12 months after the beginning of the first sentence for the 2009 offences. This reflected no more than that the sentences for two entirely separate activities could not on any view be wholly concurrent. The complaint of double punishment is without substance.

(d) conclusions


33Manufacture for financial gain would have involved an aggravating factor which was present in other cases upon which reliance was placed, but not in this case. Further, although the sentencing judge accepted that those consuming the drug would extend beyond the applicant and his girlfriend, no figures or amounts were known. In those circumstances the Court must act on the basis that supply would be to a relatively small number, in small amounts. That diminishes the culpability of the applicant.

34The fact that the primary purpose of the manufacture was to feed the applicant's addiction, rather than to supply any other person, again diminishes the applicant's culpability. These factors were missing from the cases which tend to support a range encompassing the sentences in fact imposed on the applicant. On that view, it may be seen that the sentencing judge fell into error and that less severe sentences were warranted in law. Accordingly it is appropriate for the Court to quash the sentences imposed and pass other sentences in substitution therefor: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). 

Resentencing


35Applying the discount for the various pleas accepted by the sentencing judge, the starting point for the first manufacturing offence was six years and eight months (80 months), reducing to a five year sentence. The starting point for the second manufacturing offence was eight years, reducing to six years with the discount for the plea. Given that the Surry Hills offence was carried out primarily for personal use and not for commercial profit, the starting point was too high. Accepting that the second offence deserved a heavier penalty, a proportionate reduction of that sentence should follow.

36An appropriate starting point for the 2009 manufacturing offence is five years, being (as it happens) one-third of the maximum sentence, which, when reduced by 25%, gives a sentence of three years and nine months (45 months). In conformity with the proportion adopted by the sentencing judge, this should be formulated as a non-parole period of two years, three months (27 months) and a balance of term of one year and six months (18 months).

37The trial judge increased the starting point with respect to the 2011 manufacturing offence by 20%. In conformity with this approach, but not adopting a precise calculation, the starting point would be approximately six years which, reduced for the plea of guilty, should result in a term of imprisonment of four years, nine months (57 months). Again broadly adopting the same relationship between the parts of the sentence, there should be a non-parole period of two years, nine months (33 months) with a balance of term of two years (24 months). 

38There is no ready equation between the sentences for the lesser offences and the manufacturing offences, except that the maximum term for the lesser offences is 10 years imprisonment, as against 15 years for the manufacturing offences. An appropriate sentence in respect of the lesser offences is, in each case, to impose a fixed term of about one-third of the sentence for the more serious offence. Thus, in respect of the Surry Hills offences, each would carry a sentence of 15 months imprisonment and in respect of the Hurstville offences, a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment.

39The final step is to achieve an appropriate degree of accumulation. The starting point adopted by the sentencing judge took account of a period of custody referable solely to the Surry Hills offences. The first sentences commenced on 19 December 2010: that starting date should be adopted.

40The period of one year which the sentencing judge imposed, solely attributable to the Surry Hills offences, was appropriate. That may be achieved by making the Surry Hills manufacturing sentence commence on 19 April 2011 and the lesser offences at Hurstville on 19 December 2011. The manufacturing offence at Hurstville should commence six months later, on 19 June 2012. The non-parole period on that offence will run for two years and nine months, rendering the applicant first eligible for parole on 18 March 2015, being an overall period of mandatory custody of four years and three months. 

41That will allow a period of two years balance of parole, which will be an important test of the ability and willingness of the applicant to live up to his own expressed contrition and the hopes of the sentencing judge that he would avoid illegal drugs in the future, recognising the harm that he has caused not only to himself but also to those close to him.

42ADAMS J : I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Basten JA, with whose conclusions and reasoning I respectfully agree. However, I prefer to state my own reasons for agreeing with the orders his Honour proposes. 

43One of the reasons for concluding that the overall sentence, as well as the individual sentences are manifestly excessive is the guidance to be derived from other judgments of this Court dealing with offences of the same kind, even if their objective seriousness is greater than those for which the appellant was sentenced. Of course, it is necessary to be cautious when considering the significance of sentences imposed in other cases: quite apart from the different facts, both objective and subjective, which led to those sentences, the judge in each case must apply his or her own views about the appropriate sentence, making a personal judgment of the way in which the various elements of the sentencing task lead to the particular discretionary conclusion. At the same time, it is an important feature of the administration of justice that, allowing for the variations between cases, the process of sentencing should aim at coherence and, to the extent it can be conscientiously done, like cases should be treated the same way: see the passages from the judgment of the plurality in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520, helpfully set out in the judgment of Latham J. Taking the problem presented in this appeal, as I see it - with the qualifications to which I have already referred - less serious cases should have less severe consequences. 

44In the present appeal, the most important feature of each set of offences, (in chronological order, the Surry Hills and the Hurstville offences) so far as their objective seriousness is concerned, is that the manufacture was not for ""any level of commerciality"". This consideration very significantly reduces the objective seriousness of both the manufacture of methylamphetamine and the possession of apparatus/precursor materials. (In respect of the latter, the possession of safrole does not, with respect, strike me as particularly significant if, as seems to be the case, it was not obtained for sale or to make ecstasy for sale.) So far as the Hurstville offences are concerned, the fact that they were committed whilst the appellant was on bail for the Surry Hills offences must be regarded as a significant aggravating feature. 

45The Court's attention was drawn to a number of cases, to which I now turn. 

46In R v Dolman [2001] NSWCCA 99 the offender appealed against a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months for the offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. He had no relevant prior record and was contrite with good prospects of rehabilitation. His plea was early. He was an industrial chemist and was paid at the usual hourly rate for legitimate work for the production of precursor drugs and training two other persons in the production of drugs which he was aware would be used to manufacture methylamphetamine. He suffered from psychiatric problems, significant cognitive impairment and pre-senile dementia. The Court concluded that the sentence, though severe, was not manifestly excessive.

47In R v Turkmani [2002] NSWCCA 388; (2002) 133 A Crim R 328, the offender appealed against sentences imposed for two offences, committed two years apart, of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of MDMA (ecstasy). For the first offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and, for the second, 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. The overall sentence was 8 years imprisonment with an aggregate non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. Three relatively minor offences were taken into account on a Form 1. In relation to the first offence, the offender, who though only 18 years old and the nephew of a more significant participant, played ""not an insignificant role"" in the manufacture. The laboratory used for the second offence was rather more elaborate. The purpose was to manufacture as much of the drug as possible for the purpose of making as much profit as possible. In relation to the second offence, the offender's role was that of co-principal. He was on bail for the first offence when he committed the second. The discounts allowed for the pleas were about 14 per cent for the first offence and 12 per cent for the second. The principal complaints concerned these discounts. The Court upheld the appeal, largely though not exclusively on this ground, and resentenced the offender for the second matter to 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The sentence for the first offence was undisturbed. The Court noted that the fact that the second offence was committed whilst on bail ""considerably aggravated"" its seriousness.

48R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165 was a Crown appeal against a suspended sentence of 2 years imposed following a plea of guilty to an offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Another offence of manufacturing methylamphetamine and a charge of being in possession of two unregistered firearms were taken into account on a Form 1. The offender's involvement was permitting his premises to be used for the manufacture. It was committed whilst he was on bail awaiting trial for the manufacture offence later taken into account on the Form 1. The explanation that he cooperated because of threats was, in effect, rejected. He had a minor criminal record and his prospects for rehabilitation were good. The appeal was allowed and ""the least sentence ... verging on the inadequate"" was imposed, namely 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year. (Although not specifically mentioned, it should be inferred that a discount of 25 per cent for the plea was allowed.)

49In R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 355; (2005) 156 A Crim R 225 the appellant was sentenced for four offences: manufacture of methylamphetamine, (deemed) supply methylamphetamine, possess a precursor for the manufacture of methylamphetamine and possess a prohibited weapon (pistol). The offences involved a commercial enterprise of manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine. The appellant suffered since childhood from severe psychiatric disorders involving lengthy periods in hospital where he was sexually abused. His family was dysfunctional and he left home at 14. He was the father of six children, four left in his care, one of whom had severe behavioural problems, seriously exacerbated by the appellant's incarceration. The appellant was described as having ""made quite remarkable progress towards rehabilitation"". Error having been demonstrated (for reasons presently immaterial), the Court resentenced the appellant. On each of the manufacture and supply charges concurrent sentences were imposed of a head sentence of six years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months. On the possess precursor charge, a wholly concurrent fixed term of 2 years was imposed whilst, on the possess firearm offence a wholly concurrent sentence of 18 months was imposed. A discount for the plea of 20 per cent was allowed. Thus, the starting point was 7 years and 6 months.

50In Langham v R [2006] NSWCCA 306 the offender pleaded guilty to the offences of manufacturing and supplying methylamphetamine, asking that an offence involving a drug to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine be taken into account. For the manufacture, the offender was sentenced to 3 years 4 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. For the supply, the sentence was 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months, adjusted to yield an effective sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The enterprise was commercial, the offender and his co-offender playing equal parts. Though not large, the volume of the expected product was not insignificant. The offender's record included three earlier drug-related offences but not so serious as the present charges. Subjectively, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder arising from very serious assaults on him. The sentences were held to be appropriate and the appeal dismissed. 

51In McKibben v R [2007] NSWCCA 89 the appellant pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine, supplying methylamphetamine on an ongoing basis contrary, and two further counts of supplying methylamphetamine. Taken into account on the first offence were offences of supplying heroin and disposing of stolen property. In respect of that offence, the sentence was 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The appellant was closely involved over an extended period in the manufacture and supply of drugs. She was 58 years of age, with prior convictions for drug offences with little or no prospects of rehabilitation. The appeal was allowed on the ground that the discount for the plea should have been 25 per cent rather than 15 per cent. The resulting sentence for this offence was, therefore, 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.

52In Diesing & Ors v R [2007] NSWCCA 326, Diesing had pleaded guilty to one offence of conspiring to manufacture not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. This was a commercial enterprise out of which the appellant hoped to obtain substantial profits. His criminal history included three convictions for the possession of drugs. He was on parole at the time of committing the index offence. There were no subjective features of any significance. On resentencing, the starting point was 11 years, which was reduced to 8 years and 9 months on application of a 20 per cent discount. A non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months was imposed. Hamilton had pleaded guilty to offences of supplying an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine, supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, conspiring to manufacture an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine and conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. In respect of the third offence, he was sentenced to a head sentence of 5 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. He was a principal in the commercial enterprise. His record included offences of possessing a prohibited drug. There was no evidence, except for the plea, that he was contrite or remorseful. His plea resulted in a discount of 15%, implying a starting point of six years eleven months, rounded down. His appeal against this sentence was dismissed. Czerwinski pleaded guilty to supplying an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine, conspiracy to manufacture an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine and conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. For the second offence he was sentenced to a term of 5 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months. The application of a discount of 15 per cent implied a starting point of 6 years 1 months, rounded down. His role was a major one in a commercial venture which engaged a number of people over two states, involving a deliberate and sustained period of criminal offending. For practical purposes he had no record. He was 62 years old, remorseful, with good prospects of rehabilitation. The appeal against this sentence was dismissed.

53In R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289; (2008) 191 A Crim R 409, the respondent pleaded guilty to three offences comprising manufacturing methylamphetamine, conspiracy to manufacture not less than the large commercial quantity of MDMA (ecstasy) and the deemed supply of not less than the commercial quantity of LSD. He was on parole at the time with convictions for similar offences. The respondent arranged the supply of chemicals for a ""cook"" and also provided the premises owned by his brother where the manufacture was to take place. The respondent had assisted authorities and was genuinely contrite with good prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown appeal was allowed. Applying a combined discount of 55 per cent the respondent was resentenced to a fixed term of 4 years and 6 months. As Latham J points out, this sentence needs to be considered in light of the fact that this was a Crown appeal. I would add also that it is - for reasons it is unnecessary to discuss - impossible to infer the commencing point for the notional head sentence.

54In Hudson v R [2009] NSWCCA 59 the offender was convicted of attempting to manufacture a prohibited drug (ephedrine), attempting to manufacture methylamphetamine (in the alternative following acquittal for the completed offence) and conspiring to manufacture ephedrine. Each offence carried a maximum sentence of 15 years. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years on each offence, to be served concurrently. His criminal record included 5 drug related convictions, including supplies. The relevant conduct was persistent and the offender's role was as a co-principal. There was no evidence of contrition and no good prospects of rehabilitation. In rejecting the complaint that the sentence was manifestly excessive, Blanch J (with whom Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Howie J agreed) observed (at [28]) that the sentences ""had to take account of the need for general deterrence to be reflected in sentencing where drugs are being manufactured or attempts are being made to manufacture drugs which are to be sold for profit in the community. There are many statements in this Court to that effect ..."" The details of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders were given, as one of the (rejected) grounds was parity. One of the offender's accomplices, Griffiths, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to manufacture ephedrine and was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 18 months on one count and 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, adjusted to yield an overall sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. Another accomplice, Campbell, pleaded guilty to manufacturing methylamphetamine and, with two offences taken into account, was sentenced to 2 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 1 year.

55In Petterson v R [2013] NSWCCA 133 the offender appealed on parity grounds against a sentence of 5 years 3 months with non-parole period of 3 years for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine and a wholly concurrent sentence of 3 years 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years for attempting (the police having substituted an inert substance) to possess a precursor to use in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. The index offences were part of an organised criminal activity in which the offender who had been given the responsibilities of looking after the process of manufacturing and taking delivery of the pseudoephedrine. That the offender persisted in performing his role in receiving the precursor two days after escaping from police custody following his arrest for the manufacture offence was a further significant aggravating factor. He was on parole for an offence of armed robbery, having had four offences of supplying a prohibited drug taken into account when sentenced for that offence. He received a 25 per cent discount for his pleas. The implied starting points for the head sentences were therefore respectively 7 and 5 years. The appeal was dismissed.

56In weighing up the significance of these examples, it is necessary to bear in mind that, in some cases, the offender had a significant criminal record whilst in all he played a major role in a substantial, organised, commercial criminal enterprise involving the trafficking or proposed trafficking of drugs on a continuing basis. These cases, therefore, demonstrate a markedly higher degree of objective seriousness than the present case. It is also necessary to bear in mind the somewhat higher discounts in some cases. It should also be noted that the sentences for possessing precursors were concurrent. The commercial character of the criminal enterprises undertaken by the offenders is of considerable significance in assessing also the objective seriousness of the precursor offences. Where the precursor is obtained for the purpose of manufacturing drugs to be commercially trafficked, the objective seriousness of doing so must be considerably greater than when the purpose is to manufacture for a non-commercial purpose. Accordingly, the examples provide some helpful guidance in respect of all the offences with which we are concerned in this appeal. 

57It is clear from the above that I regard the non-commercial character of the offences here as a most significant factor both of itself and as distinguishing this case from the examples. With respect, R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247 does not suggest otherwise. In that case the appellants were involved in a syndicate, comprising six other offenders, which undertook the large scale commercial supply of drugs over a lengthy period. One of the appellants contended that his subjective circumstances were not appropriately considered by the primary judge. Wood CJ at CL (the other judges agreeing) said - 

[98] It was submitted in substance that this Applicant's motivation to become a party to the enterprise arose in circumstances where he was a victim of the vicious cycle of use and supply and was not a trafficker for greed, thereby placing him at the lower level of criminality: R v Tulloh NSWCCA 16 September 1993. That proposition was specifically rejected by his Honour in the passage earlier cited, and while his drug use may have helped explain the reasons for his joinder of the enterprise it did not, in any way, excuse it for the reasons which I identified in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [236] to [259]. Moreover the decision in Tulloh does not provide a basis for a proposition stated in the bald terms submitted, as appears from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in so far as his Honour noted that each case depends on its own circumstances, and that a custodial sentence is normal in the case of trafficking to any substantial degree, whether or not a profit has been obtained. 

58The matter being considered was the appellant's motive for being engaged in the commercial enterprise of which he was a part. With respect, the discussion does not suggest that the fact that the enterprise was of such a character was of little or no importance. 

59The examples are, of course, a small sample and do not by themselves demonstrate that the sentences here under consideration are outside the discretionary range. Nor can they be regarded, in any sense, as setting a range or appropriate level of sentencing for these offences. However, they are not without significance. I respectfully disagree with Latham J's assessment of their consistency with the sentences under appeal. When making allowance for the factors to which I have referred, it seems to me, with respect, that the sentence of 5 years for the Surry Hills Offence is markedly inconsistent with the sentences imposed in Williams and Diesing. Of course, the true comparator is the combined sentence for both the manufacture and the precursor offences. In the former case, whilst the offender's subjective case was entitled to significant weight, the objective character of his offending was very much more serious than the appellant's. Moreover, the possession of the precursor attracted an entirely concurrent sentence. In the latter case, the objective seriousness of the offences of Hamilton and Czerwinski was substantially greater than that of the appellant. Furthermore, the former's subjective case was not as favourable as this appellant's. The same comments apply to the sentences imposed in AD and Petterson, where also the objective seriousness of the offences was much greater and the sentences for precursor offences were concurrent.

60In coming to my view of the first and second grounds of appeal, I found it helpful to take into account of the examples. I also found it useful, though in a much more qualified way, to consider the statistical information collated by the Judicial Commission. The statistics for the offence of manufacturing amphetamines involve only 16 cases. The top of the bell curve (seven cases) is a sentence of 2 years, with two cases receiving a sentence of 2 years and 6 months, four, 3 years and one, 4 years. Nine cases attracted a non-parole period of 1 year, four a 1 year 6 months period and one each 2 year and 6 months and 3 years. (Of course, the terms are rounded up.) Bearing in mind the likelihood that these offences involve manufacture for the purpose of trafficking, the statistics suggest that the sentences here are, at least, rather unusual. (It is interesting to note that, in respect of manufacturing a commercial quantity, of the 16 cases where the offender pleaded guilty, eight sentences were 5 years or less.) 

61Of objective significance is the finding that the precursor present in the appellant's premises were capable of manufacturing a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine though, again, not for a commercial purpose. The judge also accepted that the appellant was unlikely to reoffend, especially if he remains abstinent of drugs of abuse, particularly crystal amphetamine. It was this addiction that, after a year of abstinence, drove the appellant to recommence manufacturing methylamphetamine. Generally, it is appropriate to accept the primary judge's findings as to the objective and subjective factors, to which no further reference needs be made.

Conclusion

62In the end, it will often be the case that, whatever might be thought of the individual sentences, the crucial question is whether the overall sentence is manifestly excessive having regard to the criminality of the offences, considered as a whole. Here, this sentence was 8 years and 5 months with an aggregate non-parole period of 6 years. This implies a starting point of 11 years and 3 months, with slight rounding down, for an overall sentence otherwise appropriate before applying discounts. Had the manufacture been undertaken for the purpose of trafficking, an overall sentence of this order would, with respect, have been unremarkable. To my mind, however, where the methylamphetamine was manufactured for the purpose, essentially, of personal use, though some was given to his girlfriend and others, which also was the reason for obtaining the precursors, the overall sentence is manifestly excessive, making every allowance for the aggravation arising from its repetition whilst the appellant was on bail.

63Furthermore, I agree with Basten JA that each of the sentences under appeal is manifestly excessive. 

64I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA. 

65LATHAM J : The applicant, Hoang Thanh Dang, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him on 15 June 2012 with respect to several charges arising out of the manufacture of methylamphetamine inside residential premises on two occasions in July 2009 (Surry Hills) and April 2011 (Hurstville). 

66The applicant was found not guilty on 20 March 2012 after a trial by judge alone on a charge of manufacture a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, on the basis that the Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that a commercial quantity had been manufactured between 19 May and 15 July 2009. The applicant was convicted of the statutory alternative, namely, manufacture prohibited drug, pursuant to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act). That offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment. 

67The applicant entered pleas of guilty on 14 March 2012 to possess drug manufacture apparatus, pursuant to s 24A(1)(b) of the Act, and five counts of possess a precursor, pursuant to s 24A(1)(a) of the Act. Each of these offences carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. 

68The applicant also pleaded guilty on 21 March 2012 to a further count of manufacture prohibited drug, pursuant to s 24(1) of the Act. That plea was accepted in the alternative to a charge of manufacture a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine between 28 February and 12 April 2011.

69The following table sets out the individual sentences.







Possess apparatus, possess precursor (3)
(Surry Hills)



On each, imprisonment for fixed term of 2 years, TDF 19 December 2010, expiring 18 December 2012.




Manufacture prohibited drug (Surry Hills)



Non-parole period 3 years TDF 19 June 2011, expiring 18 June 2014 ; balance of term 2 years, expiring 18 June 2016.



Possess precursor (2)
(Hurstville)


On each, imprisonment for fixed term of 2 years and 3 months, TDF 19 December 2011, expiring 18 March 2014.



Manufacture prohibited drug (Hurstville)


Non-parole period 3 years and 7 months, TDF 19 May 2013, expiring 18 December 2016 ; balance of term 2 years and 5 months, expiring 18 May 2019. 

70Thus, the aggregate sentence was 8 years and 5 months with an aggregate non-parole period of 6 years.

The Offences

71At about 1 pm on 14 July 2009, a fire alarm was triggered in a residential unit in Oxford Street, Surry Hills. Fire Brigade officers attended. Water was seen to be leaking from the bottom of the door of unit 508 on level 5 of the building. A fire brigade officer knocked on the door, however no one answered. Fire Brigade officers forced entry to the unit where they found the applicant and his partner. The applicant appeared to be carrying items from the kitchen area to the bathroom / bedroom area.

72 The sprinkler system inside the unit had been activated and there was a strong smell of chemicals. There were containers of chemicals, plastic containers, glass bottles, broken glass and a portable electric heating element within the unit. It appeared that there had been a fire in the kitchen. The applicant and his partner were removed from the unit. 

73A search of a Mitsubishi vehicle registered in the name of the applicant's sister and parked in the underground car park of the unit block revealed two four-litre tins containing acetone (a precursor in the manufacture of methylamphetamine) and a number of personal belongings including the applicant's diary containing a formula for the manufacture of methylamphetamine.

74Subsequent enquiries revealed that the unit had been leased in the name of the applicant's sister from July 2007. A detailed examination of the unit carried out on the morning of 15 July disclosed the following relevant items :-

(a)Glassware associated with chemistry, such as flasks and beakers including a 1 litre glass twin reaction flask, purchased by the applicant's partner in December 2007.

(b)Containers of chemicals including hydrochloric acid, acetone, shellite and xylene.

(c)Gas stoves or burners, as well as electric hot plates.

(d)Various containers of solutions that were subsequently analysed and found to contain by-products of methylamphetamine.

75D-methylamphetamine (methylamphetamine produced from pseudoephedrine) was found in more than 20 separate containers or places within the unit. 

76The precursors found at the unit were safrole (3.4 kgs), red phosphorous (379 gms) and iodine (640 gms). Safrole is not a precursor used in the production of methylamphetamine ; it is used in the manufacture of a different drug commonly known as ecstasy.

77Following the applicant's arrest and charging, he remained in custody until 4 November 2009 when he was released to bail on strict conditions, including a daily reporting condition. 

78 On 11 April 2011, the police executed a search warrant on the applicant's residential unit in Hurstville. A strong chemical smell was present. A two-burner hot plate near the balcony was in the process of simmering a brown liquid. The applicant admitted he was extracting pseudoephedrine. He was arrested and taken to Hurstville police station.

79 A subsequent examination of the unit found a number of containers holding waste products from the manufacture of methylamphetamine. In addition, a large quantity of glassware, such as reaction flasks, condensers, separating funnels, conical flasks, and vacuum flasks, was in the premises. Other equipment such as hotplates, a retort stand and air purifying respirators were also found. 

80The chemicals found inside the unit included hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, sodium hydroxide, acetone, methanol, xylene, sulphuric acid and shellite. These are all consistent with the manufacture of prohibited drugs.

81The precursors found in these premises were iodine (415 gms) and red phosphorous (348 gms). 

82The applicant's evidence, which was accepted by the judge, was that he ""used part of the methylamphetamine manufactured during the dates contained in the respective indictments for his own use and that he supplied to his girlfriend .... and others a portion of the methylamphetamine manufactured by him."" The judge did not find ""any level of commerciality regarding the supply of the methylamphetamine.""

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

83The applicant was born in Vietnam, the eldest of five children. The family fled to Indonesia in 1984 when the applicant was seven years of age. The applicant ultimately migrated to Australia in 1984 with his father and one sister. The applicant's mother and younger siblings settled in Australia a short time later.

84The applicant had an unremarkable family history. He reported early educational difficulties due to his inability to speak English. However, he later performed extremely well in secondary school. He was class captain and a prefect at Parramatta Marist High School. He undertook a Commerce/Law degree. He was also for some years actively involved in the Police Citizens Youth Club in Parramatta, serving on the management board between 1999 and 2006. He also did pro bono work for Vietnamese refugees. The applicant was active in sports, boxing competitively between 1996 and 2000. He was the runner-up in the State finals on one occasion and acquired a trainers licence.

85The applicant's father died in 1998. The applicant took over the paternal role within the family. His younger sister was only four or five years of age at that time. He was completing his degree at the University of Technology, Sydney at the time. He completed the degree in four and a half years with honours. He was described by Dr Furst as ""extremely bright and would more probably than not fall within the very superior range of functioning.""

86The applicant worked in the area of accounting law and as a solicitor since 2000. He was in corporate employment for four and a half years, before opening his own beauty salon in Miranda which he ran for five and half years. He then bought a beauty salon in Epping for his mother in about 2003.

87When the applicant was about 27 years of age, within about a year of moving out of home, he had his first drug experience. He began using crystal methylamphetamine on a regular basis. His use steadily escalated to the point where he was using about 0.5 g per day.

88The applicant told Dr Furst that he committed the subject offences because he could no longer afford to support his habit from his legitimate paid employment. Following his arrest for the Surry Hills offences, he remained abstinent for approximately one year. However, in early 2011 he relapsed into a pattern of daily use which precipitated the commission of the Hurstville offences.

89The applicant gave evidence during the sentencing proceedings. He expressed his desire to undertake rehabilitation. The judge accepted that the applicant was remorseful and that he had made good progress whilst in custody. The judge accepted Dr Furst's opinion that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend if he remained abstinent from drug use.

The Grounds of Appeal

90Grounds 1 and 2 are inter-related in that ground 1 alleges manifest excess in both the individual and aggregate sentences, while ground 2 complains of error in ""failing to reflect principles of proportionality and totality"".

91Ground 3 claims that the judge inadequately reflected the finding of special circumstances in the aggregate non-parole period. It is convenient to deal with this ground first.

Special Circumstances

92His Honour found special circumstances on the basis that it was the applicant's first time in custody, that there was a degree of accumulation, and that the applicant required ""ongoing rehabilitation in the community"". The ratio between the aggregate non-parole period and the aggregate head sentence is 71%.

93Immediately after passing sentence, the Crown representative, the judge and the applicant's representative had the following exchange :-

STANHOPE : Your Honour has made a finding of special circumstances. I with respect don't know that that's reflected in the totality -
HIS HONOUR : It's impossible having regard to accumulation to reflect it accurately, and I have considered that.
STANHOPE : You have considered that?
HIS HONOUR : I certainly have considered that, yes. When I said nine years, that is not correct. It is eight years, overall sentence eight years and six months, non-parole period of six years. ["".......""]

WEBB : The only matter - and your Honour may well have considered it - is the overall sentence and the disturbance of the statutory ratio in light of your finding of special circumstances. Your Honour has dealt with that as I understand it, but for abundant caution if your Honour is of the view that that is considered I will say no more.
HIS HONOUR : As I indicated to the Crown it was considered by me, and having regard to the accumulation of sentences, but in so far as the special circumstances are concerned he's given the benefit of the finding of special circumstances in respect of two of the components of the sentencing.
WEBB : Being the fixed terms and the concurrency, and so forth?
HIS HONOUR : No, in respect of counts one and in respect of count eight - just that the overall sentence does not reflect, well it's eight years and six months which is - its very close. ......... I'm not in any way going to change the sentences. I was fully aware of the situation.

94Counts 1 and 8 were the two offences of manufacture a prohibited drug. In each of the sentences imposed for these offences, a modest alteration of the statutory ratio was made (66% in respect of count 1 and 60% in respect of count 8). His Honour in fact imposed an aggregate sentence of 8 years and 5 months, not 8 years and 6 months. 

95The applicant argues that, in spite of his Honour's insistence that he was ""fully aware of the situation"", there is patent error in the failure to translate the extent of the finding of special circumstances in respect of counts 1 and 8 into the aggregate non-parole period. In effect, the applicant maintains that the aggregate non-parole period ought to be in the order of 5 years and 4 months (63% of the aggregate sentence). 

96Had there been no indication in the judge's remarks that he intended the result that was in fact achieved, the applicant may be on stronger ground. However, his Honour clearly and emphatically determined in the exercise of his sentencing discretion that the aggregate non-parole period ought not depart to any significant degree from the statutory ratio. This Court should be very slow to find error in the face of evidence that the result was intended. His Honour obviously considered that the aggregate non-parole period he imposed was the least time that the applicant should spend in custody in order to adequately reflect the objective gravity of the offences.

97There is no basis for assuming that the applicant's need for rehabilitation in the community cannot be met by a parole period of two years and five months. This case stands apart from those cases where this Court has found that an intention to provide for a lengthy period under supervision has not been carried into effect because of the accumulation of sentences: see the discussion at [31] - [41] in Fina'i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134. 

98This ground of the appeal has no merit.

Manifest Excess

99The applicant's argument on this ground begins with an acknowledgement that the Judicial Commission statistics for the subject offences may be of limited usefulness, particularly where there is a small sample available with respect to each type of offence. Nonetheless, the applicant asserts that on the basis of the limited statistics available, each sentence imposed upon the applicant is at the top or outside the statistical range.

100With respect to the aggregate sentence, the applicant maintains that it is higher than those sentences imposed for offences of objectively greater criminality, relying upon a submission relating to four cases of manufacture a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine discussed in R v Cheung; R v Choi [2010] NSWCCA 244 at [68] to [70].

101In addition, whilst acknowledging that the sentences imposed for the Hurstville offences were necessarily more severe because of their commission while the applicant was on conditional liberty for identical prior offences, it is said that the extent of accumulation of these offences on the earlier offences was excessive. The applicant submits that the judge erred by imposing a form of double punishment on the applicant for his breach of conditional liberty, by way of the severity of the sentences on the individual Hurstville offences and by way of the extent of accumulation of the sentences for the offences at Hurstville upon the sentences for the offences committed at Surry Hills. 

102Before proceeding to a consideration of these submissions in greater detail, it is helpful to re-visit what the plurality said in Hili v The Queen ; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 ; 242 CLR 520 at [47] - [49] and [53] - [55]. Reasonable consistency in sentencing, bearing in mind that discretionary decision making invariably gives rise to a degree of inconsistency, is not demonstrated by numerical equivalence. The variable nature of the circumstances of relevant offences and of the personal circumstances of the offenders render any statistical analysis of sentencing outcomes largely useless. Furthermore, information about sentences passed in other cases does not establish a ""correct"" range for a given offence. The information may provide assistance to a sentencing judge in identifying unifying principles, but it does not establish the upper or lower limits of a sentence that is appropriate to a given offence. 

103The applicant's submission summarised at [99] above relies entirely upon the ""bare statistics"". Those statistics do not allow this Court to examine the whole of the circumstances that resulted in the sentences making up the asserted range. Moreover, the sample is small - only 16 cases are recorded for the offence of manufacture amphetamine under s 24(1) between July 2005 and June 2012, where the offender pleaded guilty. While the sentences range between 6 months and 4 years, according to those statistics, a brief reference to a number of decisions of this Court demonstrate conclusively that the ""statistical range"" does not accurately represent the actual range.

104In R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 355 ; 156 A Crim R 225, this Court on 16 September 2005 re-sentenced an offender who had pleaded guilty to manufacture methylamphetamine, among other charges, to 6 years' imprisonment. The appeal was upheld on a manifest excess ground, taking into account the offender's psychiatric condition and the needs of his disturbed son. The offender was 39 years old with a drug related criminal history and an addiction to amphetamines. He was solely responsible for the manufacture of the drug from his home in Granville. 

105In Diesing & Ors. v R [2007] NSWCCA 326, the Court confirmed a sentence of 5 years and 10 months imposed on each of two co-offenders following pleas of guilty to conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine, among other charges. Both offenders played a significant role in the offence. They were 35 and 59 years of age respectively, with minor criminal histories. 

106In R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289, this Court allowed a Crown appeal in respect of an offence of manufacture amphetamine, among other offences, where the offender supplied the necessary chemicals to a ""cook"" at premises made available by the offender's brother. The offender was 35 years of age with a prior criminal history. He was on parole at the time. He received a 55% discount for the plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities. The Court imposed a fixed term of 4 years and 6 months, which was partially concurrent (to the extent of 3 years and 6 months) with non-parole periods imposed on other more serious offences. Having regard to the discount and the fact that this was a Crown appeal, the sentence is less than the offence otherwise warranted.

107In Petterson v R [2013] NSWCCA 133, this Court confirmed a sentence of 5 years and 3 months imposed in the District Court on 7 August 2009 following a plea of guilty to an offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of amphetamine, among other offences. The offender was 24 years of age with a prior criminal history. He was on parole at the time of the offence. He participated in the manufacture with two others at a property near Temora. 

108It is trite to observe that comparison with other cases does not reveal manifest excess or manifest inadequacy, any more than a consideration of a notional ""range"" represented by statistics. It is possible however, to draw out from the cases some underlying principles which assist in undertaking that exercise.

109The role of the offender, the amount of the drug actually produced or capable of being produced, the age of the offender, the existence of a prior criminal history and the commission of the offence whilst on conditional liberty each play a part in the assessment of the offender's moral culpability and the objective gravity of the offence. It has also been held that prior good character is of less weight in the commission of drug offences generally. In cases of manufacture, the purchase of the necessary chemicals requires the offender to produce identification and complete a declaration. 

110Where the offender is the principal, who is responsible for every aspect of the manufacture, from the purchasing of chemicals, glassware, and equipment, to the establishment of the laboratory within the chosen premises and the production of the drug itself, there is a high degree of moral culpability. It is submitted, in effect that the applicant's moral culpability was attenuated by the fact of his addiction, which indirectly also mitigated the objective gravity of the offences because he was manufacturing essentially for personal use. The synthesis of this factor in the sentencing exercise, both as to moral culpability and objective gravity, was an integral part of the exercise of the sentencing discretion.

111In my view, the commission of two drug manufacturing offences in order to feed an addiction voluntarily acquired by an adult (and in this case, a highly intelligent one), whilst providing some explanation, does little to mitigate the objective gravity of the offences or reduce the offender's moral culpability: R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 at [32] per Howie J, (Studdert and Whealy JJ agreeing); R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247 at [98]; R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [194] to [202] per Spigelman CJ (Newman and Hulme JJ agreeing). 

112I acknowledge that it is an aggravating feature of an offence that it is committed for financial gain (s 21A(2)(o) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). However, it is an error to convert the absence of such an aggravating factor into a mitigating one : Louizos v R [2009] NSWCCA 71; 194 A Crim R 223, per Howie J at [91] - [92], McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreeing.

113As to moral culpability, the judge expressly adverted to the absence of a commercial element and exercised his sentencing discretion with that concession in mind. I am not persuaded that any error has been demonstrated in this respect.

114Having regard to these factors and the guidance provided by the combination of the relevant statistics and cases, I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed for the manufacture offences are manifestly excessive. The sentence of 5 years for the Surry Hills offence is not inconsistent with the sentences imposed in Williams and Diesing. The sentence of 6 years for the Hurstville offence is not inconsistent with the sentences imposed in AD and Petterson. 

115In terms of the objective gravity of these offences, I accept the Crown submission that their commission in built up residential areas, with the attendant increased risk of harm to others and/or damage to property, is a material factor. This risk was realised by the fire in the Surry Hills unit, yet the applicant chose to undertake the same activity with the same attendant risks whilst on bail for the same offence.

116Turning to the sentences imposed for the offences of possess apparatus and precursors, there can be no complaint of manifest excess on the basis of the statistics alone. The applicant points to a range of 18 months to 5 years' imprisonment for the 18 offenders sentenced between July 2005 and June 2012. Against this range, sentences of 2 years for each of the s 24A offences committed at Surry Hills and 2 years 3 months for each of the s 24A offences committed at Hurstville are entirely appropriate, particularly given the judge's finding that the chemicals were capable of manufacturing a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine. This was independent of the quantity of the drug that was the subject of the manufacture offences. 

117The applicant's submissions with respect to the aggregate sentence focuses primarily upon the extent of the accumulation. It is argued that the offences relating to the possession of apparatus and precursors reflect ""the same conduct and overall criminality"" as the manufacturing offences, that manufacture is not possible without precursors and that such offences are commonly taken into account on a Form 1. 

118The latter argument ignores the fact that the judge was required to impose an appropriate sentence for each offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty, having regard to the relevant maximum penalty, and then consider, in the exercise of his discretion, how best to structure the sentences in order to arrive at an aggregate sentence which appropriately reflected the totality of the applicant's criminality : Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57 ; 194 CLR 610 at [45]. It is no part of a sentencing court's function or this Court's function to consider the imposition of sentence by reference to a different and potentially less punitive exercise of the prosecutorial discretion : Elias v The Queen ; Issa v The Queen [2013] HCA 31 at [26], [32] and [34]. 

119Clearly, the judge was of the view that the possession of apparatus and precursors did not reflect the same conduct and criminality as the manufacture offences. A cogent reason for that approach was that the applicant had already manufactured a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine in the Surry Hills unit when the fire broke out, prompting the discovery of the laboratory, including the equipment and precursors necessary for ongoing manufacture. Moreover, one of the precursors related to the manufacture of an entirely different drug. Similarly, the precursors at the Hurstville unit were obviously intended for use in the manufacture of more methylamphetamine than had been made up to that point. 

120The cases referred to in Cheung and Choi have little or no relevance, given that three of the four related to single counts of manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. All four cases were brought to the attention of this Court in Cheung and Choi by the respondents to a Crown appeal, in support of a submission that the respondents' sentences ought not be disturbed. They do not provide an adequate basis for comparison with an aggregate sentence imposed for different offences.

121I turn to the applicant's argument that there is error in the extent of the accumulation of the sentences for the Hurstville offences. 

122Dealing with each discrete period of offending, the aggregate sentence imposed for the Surry Hills offences is 5 years and 6 months. The aggregate sentence for the Hurstville offences is 7 years and 5 months. The greater aggregate sentence for the Hurstville offences appropriately reflected the fact that they were committed whilst on bail. 

123The applicant's submission that the effective accumulation of the Hurstville offences on the Surry Hills offences to the extent of one year constitutes a form of ""double punishment"" is, in my opinion, misconceived. The only question with which this Court ought be concerned is whether the sentencing discretion miscarried, in that the aggregate sentence manifestly exceeds an ""appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences"" : R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 ; R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272.

124The sentencing judge in his discussion with the applicant's counsel before delivering sentence foreshadowed a degree of accumulation, which was accepted. The judge's assessment of the totality of the applicant's criminality must be considered having regard to the following findings, which were open to his Honour :-

(a)The apparatus and precursors the subject of the Surry Hills and Hurstville offences were capable of manufacturing a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine.

(e)The applicant manufactured not less than 250gms of methylamphetamine in the Surry Hills premises, although it was not possible to say over what period of time.

(f)The applicant committed the Hurstville offences whilst on bail for precisely the same offending.

125Given the need for both general deterrence and a measure of specific deterrence to be reflected in the sentence, the maximum penalties for each of the offences, and the number and variety of the offences, I am unable to reach the conclusion that the individual or aggregate sentences are plainly unjust. It is not to the point that this Court might have taken a different approach. The applicant has not demonstrated that the individual or aggregate sentences were outside the judge's broad sentencing discretion.

126The orders I propose are :-

(i)Leave to appeal granted.

(ii)Appeal dismissed.

2ADAMS J:

Introduction

3The appellant was charged with four counts of aggravated sexual assault (described as representative) of his then wife, the complainant, between 1 March 1992 and 31 December 1992, 1 June 1992 and 30 April 1993 (two offences) and 1 April 2003 and 30 April 2003. The alleged circumstance of aggravation was that, at the time of the assault, the appellant maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on the complainant (in respect of the first assault, bruising and the others, internal injuries causing bleeding). In respect of each of the four counts, the appellant was convicted on 26 September 2011 of the statutory alternative of sexual assault. He was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 26 September 2011. There is only one ground of appeal, namely that the learned trial judge erred in failing to inform the jury of the significant forensic disadvantage suffered by the appellant as a consequence of delay. 

The nature of the case

4It is necessary, in order to appreciate how the complaint of the appellant arises, to briefly summarise the Crown and defence cases. 

The complainant's evidence

5The complainant and the appellant met in 1986 when the former was 16 and the latter 17 and then in high school in Finland. The appellant left Finland and came to Australia, where his parents and sister were living but was unable to find work and returned to Finland in 1987 or 1988. On 5 May 1989 the complainant and the appellant married and their son Nicholas was born in Finland on 31 July 1990. The family moved to Australia in October 1991 when Nicholas was about 18 months old. The complainant's knowledge of English was poor when she arrived, although the appellant's English was fluent as he had been to school in Australia. 

6The assault comprising the first count involved forcible, non-consensual vaginal intercourse in the bedroom of their home, shortly after the couple moved into a unit at Collaroy. On the following day the complainant noticed bruising to the inside of her thighs, around her vagina and the pubic bone and on her wrists and upper arms. She told the appellant that he had raped her, to which he replied, ""I'm sure it happens in marriages, it's just not talked about"". A few days later, the appellant saw the bruises on the inside of the complainant's legs and said that he did not think that he was ""that rough"". The complainant did not make any complaint about this attack as she knew no one in Australia and had very little knowledge of English.

7The appellant, shortly after obtaining work at a sex shop, started demanding sex when he came home and kept harassing the complainant until she gave in. She said that this resulted in many arguments. Their sexual intimacy changed. The appellant brought home pornographic magazines and videos and began to insist on sexual experimentation with some of which the complainant was not comfortable. After a time, the appellant raised the subject of anal sex with the complainant, attempting to persuade her to try it. The complainant did not wish to but, feeling pressured by the appellant, tried it and hated it, complaining that it was disgusting and hurt. She told him she did not want to try it again. 

8The assault giving rise to count 2 occurred a couple of months after the first rape. It commenced as consensual sex but the appellant then withdrew and attempted to insert his penis into the complainant's anus. The complainant ineffectually resisted, asking him to stop because it ""hurts so much"", but the appellant did not do so until after he had ejaculated. He then left the bedroom. The complainant went to the bathroom and noticed semen and blood coming from her anus. She asked the appellant what could she do, that she needed to go to the doctor as she might need stitches. The appellant simply responded, ""It was your own fault because you didn't relax"". The bleeding continued for several days, gradually reducing. The complainant did not go to a doctor. 

9So far as count 3 is concerned, the assault occurred when Nicholas was about two years of age. The appellant came into their bedroom, where the complainant was making the bed, and demanded sex, which the complainant refused. The appellant pushed her onto the bed and pulled her clothes off, the complainant saying, ""No, no, no, don't do it"". Whilst anal intercourse was occurring, Nicholas came into the bedroom and asked the appellant what he was doing. The complainant said she stopped resisting and held her son's hand and told him that it would soon be over. She felt a very painful tearing in the anus but intercourse continued until the appellant ejaculated. On subsequent occasions, when Nicholas walked into the room whilst the appellant was having sexual intercourse with the complainant, the appellant stopped. The complainant said after this occasion she tried to be as quiet as possible to avoid disturbing their son. She told the appellant she would never forgive him.

10Whenever the complainant complained to the appellant, he responded that, as she consented to vaginal sex initially, it would not be considered as rape. The complainant thought for some years that this was so.

11Contextual evidence was given that the appellant had penile anal intercourse with the complainant against her will every three weeks or so. The appellant did not ask the complainant if she wanted to have anal sex and she never consented to it. On each occasion she bled for a couple of days and sometimes up to several weeks, the longest period of bleeding lasting three and a half weeks. She said that she was in pain all the time, had trouble sitting and was frightened because she did not know what had happened inside her. After some time she decided, ""trying to not resist and just do my duty"" which reduced the amount of bruising and enabled her to sit. She resisted during arguments however. 

12Eventually, the appellant stopped working at the sex shop and the couple bought a cleaning business with the proceeds from the sale of some land which they had earlier bought. The appellant worked in the business during the day whilst the complainant remained at home with their son. There was an improvement in the relationship, the arguments were fewer, as were the anal rapes, although they were still continuing. The complainant became pregnant but this did not stop the appellant from anally raping her. When she was four months' pregnant, and the complainant bled afterwards, she told the appellant that if he continued she would lose the baby and he stopped. About this time, Nicholas was taken to hospital and diagnosed with a brain tumour, requiring surgery. The complainant lived with him at the hospital until she was about eight months pregnant and they returned home. At about this time, the complainant's mother came over from Finland to stay with them. Shortly afterwards the family moved to a house in Frenchs Forest. The mother stayed for about a month, visiting regularly, and then returned to Finland. 

13Whilst the complainant's mother was here, the rapes stopped. However, after their second son was born in July 1993 the appellant resumed anally raping her every week or every couple of weeks. So far as vaginal intercourse was concerned, the complainant said that the appellant raped her several times a week, especially on Wednesdays and Saturdays and sometimes more often. It would occur after work and even when she was having a nap with Nicholas, who was not yet two years old when this began. These rapes always resulted in bruising in between her legs, such that she had trouble sitting down. 

14Nicholas continued with chemotherapy and, sometime in 1994, the family moved to another house in Frenchs Forest. The complainant suggested marriage counselling but did not mention the rapes to the marriage counsellor ""as I was too scared"". They attended three or four sessions. The counsellor pulled the complainant aside towards the end and told her that she suspected domestic violence and that she should leave the appellant. The complainant did not do so, ""Because I had no money and I didn't know where would I have gone"". 

15In 1996 the family moved again. Nicholas was much improved and started school. Their younger son was about three and a half years of age. The appellant was ""getting rougher and he was aggressive"" and the complainant had begun finding pornographic magazines in the house. She decided to leave and booked tickets to Finland. The appellant had been referred by his general practitioner to a psychiatrist, Dr Cassimatis, for adult ADHD. The appellant begged the complainant to stay and arranged for further marriage counselling in the city, which the complainant reluctantly attended. She had decided to tell the counsellor in the first session about the appellant's first rape of her, but she broke down crying during the session and ran out of time to disclose the incident. The complainant said that she was only going to mention the incidents at Collaroy because of the appellant's comments that if she consented ""to vaginal sex initially the anal would not have been considered rape"". The couple attended a few more sessions and then had separate appointments. She said that the appellant got numbers from the counsellor to go to some sort of domestic violence support group but she did not know what they did there. She stopped counselling because they could not afford to continue and, as well, Nicholas relapsed, with only six months to live. 

16The family then moved to Niagara Park next door to the house occupied by the appellant's sister, Ms Louise Ede. Nicholas died in March 2000, about a year later. When he was really ill, the appellant did not pressure the complainant ""to do anything"". The couple's daughter was born in July 2001. The complainant described their relationship at this time as good and the appellant as ""very supportive"". By this time the complainant's English had improved markedly. 

17When their daughter was about six or seven months old, the relationship worsened, arguments recommenced and tension returned. Between six months and a year later, the appellant was again forcing the complainant to have anal intercourse, beginning as vaginal sex but then moving to anal sex. The complainant kept telling him that this was causing bleeding for weeks and it was serious: ""You cannot keep doing this"". At first this occurred about once a month but then two to three times a week. 

18The last occasion, which gave rise to count 4, occurred in April 2003. Again, it commenced with vaginal sex and then anal penetration. The complainant felt she had been injured and was in great pain. She tried to push the appellant away but was unable to do so. After the appellant finished she immediately went to the toilet and saw heavy bleeding from her anus, which continued for over three weeks. Two days later the complainant found a pornographic video in the lounge room. The following day she spoke to her sister-in-law, Ms Ede, and told her that the appellant had raped her and she wanted to leave. Ms Ede arranged for a mutual acquaintance, Ms McPherson, to accommodate her. The complainant spoke to an outreach worker and was taken to a women's refuge. She went to a doctor but no rectal examination was undertaken although there was blood in her urine. (I return to this matter in due course.) Ms Ede had often seen the appellant at the house after this event, apparently overnight, but never saw any ""relationship type behaviour"" and no-one suggested they were back together.

19In cross-examination the complainant said that, after the separation in May 2003, they were not reconciled, although intercourse occurred twice after that date because ""he was breaking into the house...coming to the house, and I was scared..."" She was afraid that he would sexually assault her. She denied that, after about nine weeks separation, the appellant moved back into the house and they were reconciled. She denied that she had told her sister that she went to the hospital with the appellant's sister and they had a record of her injuries. She said that she received a phone call from a policewoman after the appellant had spoken to the police but she had not wanted to make a complaint. She could not recall any conversation with Ms Ede about ringing Dr Cassimatis and denied asking Ms Ede to call and question him. She did not complain to the police because she was not strong enough, although she commenced Family Court proceedings (which were delayed pending the outcome of the trial). She said that she did not know what the appellant had said to Dr Cassimatis. 

Complaints

20It is not necessary to go through these in detail. The complainant said she told her mother-in-law that the appellant had been raping her. She was not shocked, simply asking, ""What did you do to deserve it?... There must have been a reason for it"". She spoke to her about the matter several more times over the years. Mrs Groundstroem gave a similar account, adding that she offered to take up the matter with the appellant but the complainant asked her not to. She denied asking, ""What did you do to deserve that?"" and that the matter was discussed again. 

21Ms Ede and Ms McPherson also gave evidence, which differed in some respects from the complainant's evidence. The complainant told Ms Ede, inter alia, that she had considered reporting the appellant to the police but was concerned that he would go to gaol and be unable to pay the mortgage. Ms Ede spoke to the appellant about this. He asked, in effect, if the complainant was serious about having him charged. Ms Ede told him that she thought so. Ms Ede recalled the occasion when the complainant had come to her house, very upset and saying something to the effect of needing to find passports and wanting to leave the appellant and leave the house immediately. She said, ""There was a mention of a rape"". When asked to recall this part of the conversation, she said, ""I honestly can't recall exactly but it may have been something along the lines of, '[the appellant] has raped me' but I can't remember exactly."" Ms Ede also gave evidence about the complainant asking her to call Dr Cassimatis - as she recalled, to establish Dr Cassimatis' opinion as to whether the appellant had any ""psychological issues or behavioural problems"". This conversation took place in the complainant's presence and the complainant was directing her as to the questions to ask. Ms Ede was asked - 

""Q. ... Do you recall whether Dr Cassimatis told either you or [the complainant] when you were on the phone to him about things that [the appellant] had said to him regarding a rape?
A. I can't recall him specifically saying anything like that, I more felt that he didn't particularly enjoy talking to me about [the appellant].

...

Q. Do you recall [the complainant] asking you when you were on the phone to Dr Cassimatis on her behalf saying words to the effect of, 'ask Dr Cassimatis whether [the appellant] has admitted the rape', do you remember that question?

A. I have been trying to remember if that is the case and it is possible, but I can't say for sure that it actually happened.""

22In re-examination Ms Ede said that she thought that ""from around that time, it is highly likely there was talk of a sexual assault, but I can't remember details of it in addition to the behavioural [diagnosis]."" Ms Ede also said that she had a ""very vague recollection"" of picking the complainant up from hospital once, some time after the separation, after Nicholas had passed away. 

23As mentioned, the complainant stayed at a women's refuge after she had complained to Ms Ede. She said that, whilst there, she was convinced that she should see a doctor and did so at the Kariong Medical Centre. She told the doctor that she had been sexually assaulted but did not mention any anal rapes as, ""I was still bleeding at that stage, I could not bear that anyone would look in there"". She said that no rectal examination was performed but that ""later"" there was blood in her urine, the source of which the doctor could not determine. The complainant said, ""I knew. It was from my anus..."" She said that she commenced counselling whilst living at the shelter and appreciated, after this, that the anal penetration was rape because she had not consented to it. She was at the shelter for about six weeks and then returned home. 

24Ms Buchert, the complainant's sister, gave evidence at the trial from Stockholm via audiovisual link. The first conversation she had with her sister on the subject of being raped by the appellant occurred over the telephone when Nicholas was about two years old. There were a number of conversations about the appellant raping her, the details of which do not presently matter. In one conversation, Ms Buchert suggested to the complainant that she should go to the Finnish or Swedish Consulate or Embassy. The complainant, in re-examination, said that she had gone to the Consulate (but did not say whether it was Finnish or Swedish) to talk with someone there ""about domestic violence"". She said that this would have been after 2003, after she had gone to the shelter.

25Ms McPherson gave evidence about meeting the complainant and Ms Ede at a mothers' group and the complainant with her children being brought to her place in the first half of 2003 by Ms Ede. The complainant was very upset and stayed for four nights. After a day or so she told Ms McPherson that the appellant had raped her after watching pornographic videos. Although she gave no timeframe for these rapes, Ms McPherson gathered that they had not been ""recent"" in the sense of ""the past few months"". 

26Ultimately, the sexual assaults were reported by the complainant to police on 28 September 2009. The officer in charge of the investigation requested a statement from a Dr Thompson at the Kariong Medical Centre concerning the treatment which the complainant said that she had received when at the women's refuge. However, she was advised by another staff member at the centre that Dr Thompson did not wish to complete a statement as the consultations were such a long time ago. Dr Thompson was not called as a witness. The officer also contacted Relationships Australia as to records of the counselling sessions with the complainant and the appellant but was advised that records were not available, as they are only kept for seven years. 

27The complainant told the officer, also, that the appellant talked to her about what he had discussed with Dr Cassimatis in his visits. She said that the appellant told her that he told the doctor he had been anally raping the complainant and that Dr Cassimatis would tell him not to refer to such incidents as ""anal rapes"" but as ""rough sex"". 

The appellant's admissions 

28Dr Cassimatis deposed that he had been a practising psychiatrist for about 35 years and was first consulted by the appellant in January 2001 who was referred to him to be treated for adult ADHD. He saw the appellant on a number of later occasions, ending in 2005 and on one occasion in 2010, when the appellant approached him regarding the content of his notes, which he seemed to hope or anticipate would be favourable to him. During the consultations, Dr Cassimatis made notes of the appellant's responses to questions. They were paraphrases rather than verbatim. The notes were obtained by police and tendered into evidence. In his first consultation with the appellant on 31 January 2001, which would have taken about 45 minutes, Dr Cassimatis noted, ""He is blunt, obnoxious, angry, 1993 maybe he forced himself on his wife and bruised her. He unaware of the force. She threatened police or counseling. It ceased, now he aware it is detrimental."" 

29In a consultation on 4 June 2003, about 15 to 30 minutes long, Dr Cassimatis recorded - 

""In 1991 returned from Finland. Wife returned from overseas, then for about one year he forced wife to have sex many times, including anal sex, not for 6 - 7 years he says. But from time to time he'd push her for digital and penile anal sex. Son died three years ago. [The complainant] found porn videos soon after, he gets drawn to videos of victims of senseless, he agrees he raped wife years ago but knows he bruised her and present one week later. Will attend perpetrators program, don't want to be manic, I want to be steady.""

30Dr Cassimatis said that the appellant was aware that the bruising was serious. The appellant volunteered the information that he forced his wife to have sex many times, including anal sex. He was clear about that. The appellant saw it as something to which he was entitled in a marriage situation, in his own words, ""He went with the intention to have sex on his terms, that's how I understood it"". This was so whether she wanted it or not. 

31Dr Cassimatis gave evidence of a telephone conversation with Ms Ede in which she asked whether her brother suffered from Asperger's Syndrome. He said that he told her that he didn't know that and he wasn't sure but would have to see him again. The appellant then made an appointment to come and see him for this purpose, as he understood it. This conversation occurred on 28 May 2003. Dr Cassimatis noted that he was told, ""He has split up with wife, rape accusation from wife"". 

32Sergeant Smith deposed that on 6 October 2008, the appellant attended at Gosford Police Station and asked for some advice. After a brief pause, the appellant said, ""Back in the early 90s I sexually assaulted my wife, what are the legal ramifications of this, if she reports it?"" He paused again and then added, ""you see, the bank is going to repossess our house and I want to sell it before the fire sale. My ex-wife doesn't want to sell the house. She is using the sexual assault against me, she said if I go through with the sale she will report the assault to police"". The officer obtained some details from the appellant and recorded them in his police notebook. He conducted some checks and informed the appellant that nothing had been reported to the police. The appellant was allowed to leave the station. Sergeant Smith then made an entry on the police COPS database and contacted the complainant, explaining what had happened. The complainant told him, ""Yes its true. It happened several times, I've been getting counselling ever since it occurred"" and provided some background information. She indicated that she did not wish to make a statement to the police and was ""quite upset"". In cross-examination, it was put to him that the appellant said - 

""Hi. Look, I don't know exactly how to talk about this - pause - I mean this is something that's been going on for a long time and I want it to stop, I'm sick and tired of it. Is there any way to force someone to put up or shut up if they've been making threats against you. I want to find out if there's a legal way to do it.""

Sergent Smith said he had no recollection of this and was fairly sure that it was not said. It was put to him that the appellant told him, ""Look, I'd like to talk about a few legal issues"" and then the officer interrupted him to ask, ""Now, what's all this about"", to which the appellant replied, ""The issue is about me sexually assaulting my wife. She has been claiming for years that I raped her and has been using it against me and I'm over it, I just want it to stop."" Sergeant Smith said that he did not say words like that. He denied that it was reasonably possible that he had made a mistake and left some words out in recording the appellant's comments, although he agreed that the appellant had said words to the effect, ""She's been using it against me for years"". He said that he understood the appellant perfectly. 

The defence case 

33The appellant gave evidence. Only a truncated account is necessary, given the sole ground of appeal. The appellant said that all sexual intercourse between him and the complainant was consensual although, in late 1993, the complainant accused him of raping her. He said that on one occasion after they had consensual intercourse he noticed some bruising just above the pubic bone on the complainant and she told him that it was from intercourse they had previously had. She continued to complain and the allegations increased. He said, on the occasion when Nicholas walked in whilst they were having sex, they stopped and attended to Nicholas, taking him back to bed. They had anal sex to which the complainant consented and liked. She never bled as a result nor did she seek any treatment because her anus was sore. They separated as a result of arguments but, after eight or nine weeks, they were reconciled and moved back in together in mid to late 2004 for 12 months during which time they had further consensual sex, both vaginal and anal. When the appellant and the complainant separated, the appellant was keen to resume the relationship and asked the complainant, ""What can we do to fix this"". The complainant told him that he would have to talk to Dr Cassimatis and say that he had raped her. This the appellant agreed to do. He said that when he told Dr Cassimatis that he had raped his wife, it was a lie that he had to tell in order to try ""and get my family back"", saying he would have done anything to achieve this. 

34In October 2008, when the complainant had told him that he was not going to see the children and was making further allegations about him over the separation, the appellant attended Gosford Police Station. He wanted the allegations to stop because he had no access to the children, their relationship had finished and there was no way for him to move on. He said that he went to the police station to see if they could do something about the complainant harassing him with continued allegations. He gave evidence of the matters put to Sergeant Smith, to which I have referred above. He denied admitting to Sergeant Smith that he had raped his wife. 

35The appellant said that the complainant blamed him for Nicholas' illness and the first allegations of rape were made when Nicholas was undergoing chemotherapy. He said that she made the complaint to police in September 2009 when he had threatened to sell the house as debts were piling up. The complainant would not agree to this sale so the appellant stopped paying the mortgage to force one. She complained to police, she said, a week after he stopped paying the mortgage. She had said to him that, if the house was sold and he didn't pay the bills, she would go to the police. 

36The appellant gave evidence that he and the complainant were reconciled in 2003 after they had been separated for eight to nine weeks. (The complainant denied this.) The appellant's father gave limited evidence of reconciliation. Mr Monk, called primarily as a character witness, also gave evidence in cross-examination that he often went to the house both for social occasions and to do their plumbing. He could not remember precisely the last time he visited but guessed that it would be ""three, four years ago"" (which would make it 2007 or 2008) though he could recall the last job he did (about which he was not asked). He said that the complainant had told him they had separated but the appellant was ""there quite often"". He added - 

""In fact almost every time I was there [the appellant] was there. Either he turned up while I was still working there because he had been at work in Sydney or he'd be there when I got there... I didn't stay late enough to see if he stayed there but he was certainly there when I left."" 

This was so at the time when the complainant told him that they were separated. He was asked in re-examination - 

""Q. What would make you think they were together? 

A. Well [the appellant] was always there. It always seemed much the same as when they were together to be honest.... I never really saw any evidence of them being apart.

Q. Could you tell any difference between when they were supposedly together and supposedly apart?

A. Not really, no, apart from [the complainant] telling me.""

37The appellant's father gave evidence in which he said he kept a diary in which he noted that the complainant had left the matrimonial home on 26 May 2003 and returned on 20 June 2003. He said that the appellant moved out at that time but the couple had an on and off relationship and the appellant returned and they resumed living together. In August 2004 he and his wife stayed with the appellant and the complainant. He wrote a letter on 20 September 2004 referring back to the visit the previous month. 

Directions on delay

38Before the close of the Crown case, after Sergeant Smith had completed his evidence, the judge asked counsel for submissions concerning the directions which each side wished to be given to the jury. His Honour referred to s 165B(2) of the Evidence Act 1995, and asked Mr Doyle for a ""bullet points"" summary of the particular forensic disadvantages which it was alleged had occurred, noting that this was not a situation where a witness had died or was unable to be located or any potential evidence had been lost. 

39Following some brief discussion involving the Crown prosecutor, Mr Doyle of counsel for the appellant referred the judge to s 165B(7)(b) (concerning the consideration that potential evidence has been lost or is otherwise unavailable), and mentioned two areas of evidence, which he called ""forensic evidence"" and ""medical evidence"". In respect of the former, he referred to semen. The judge (with respect, rightly) said it was immaterial as the only issue was consent rather than the fact of intercourse. This was conceded by Mr Doyle. As to medical evidence, Mr Doyle submitted there was no possibility, or not a useful possibility, of obtaining medical evidence about anal bleeding or the alleged bruising. He submitted that, because of the long delay in complaining, it was impossible to corroborate (or disprove) the complainant's evidence about these matters. The appellant was further disadvantaged by his not having any fresh recollection of what had occurred and, in respect of the bruising on the complainant's arms, no possibility of getting any independent evidence from any witnesses who may have observed her. In relation to this last matter, his Honour pointed out that the appellant had informed Dr Cassimatis that he had observed bruising. (The notes, however, do not state where the bruising was, the appellant conceding the complainant was bruised in her pubic area.) The next matter raised by Mr Doyle concerned the evidence of the appellant's sister about the complainant telling her she had visited a hospital - although this was denied by the complainant. Mr Doyle submitted that the medical records of all the hospitals in the relevant area at the time could have been subpoenaed but the effluxion of time meant that it was highly unlikely that those records still existed. Mr Doyle then asked to reserve his position and that is where the matter rested until after addresses. 

40After addresses the judge again raised s 165B of the Evidence Act and the directions about delay, asking Mr Doyle for ""a careful note as to what you say the forensic disadvantage is, the significant forensic disadvantage rather"". The weekend ensued and, on the Monday, Mr Doyle produced to his Honour a note in response to this request. It was marked MFI 7. Regrettably this document, which was handwritten, has been mislaid and the parties have not retained a copy. However, in a brief judgment given immediately after submissions, his Honour summarised the points made by Mr Doyle, which covered three areas described as ""having an adverse effect in the way in which the accused could conduct his defence"". The first matter identified was that delay had affected the appellant's ability to provide alibi evidence because of the uncertainty of the dates of the alleged assaults; the second matter was the potential availability of ""fresh forensic evidence (say, blood on the sheets) if complaint was recent""; and, lastly, that witnesses may perhaps have forgotten important exculpatory material. 

41The judge stated that it was common ground that ""from the outset of the allegations, the complainant informed the accused that his conduct amounts to rape, namely non-consensual sex, so he was aware of the complainant's complaint from the very beginning of the allegations"". His Honour therefore concluded -

""Having regard to the way in which the trial has been conducted and the evidence elicited thus far I am unable to see the disadvantage to the accused on an ability to provide an alibi, or in relation to the ability to gather fresh forensic evidence.""

42As to the last point referred to by counsel, the trial judge asked whether he could suggest any particular material. Mr Doyle replied -

""I can't think of any example off the top of my head but if there was fresh complaint there may have been witnesses that could give evidence that provided some sort of exculpatory material that I can't describe your Honour, I just can't think of an example.""

It was Mr Doyle's inability to point to any specific matter in this regard which led his Honour to dismiss it as simply being another way of complaining about ""the mere existence of a delay"" vide para 165B(6)(b). 

43It is clear, from the summary set out by his Honour, that counsel for the appellant had not pressed the matters to which he had referred when the matter was first raised and which are set out above, namely the absence of medical evidence of anal bleeding, the absence of the ability to obtain some independent evidence about bruising on the complainant's arms and the difficulty (described as ""highly unlikely"") of obtaining records from the hospital which the complainant's sister said she was told by the complainant she had attended. 

44In the result, the trial judge made no reference in his summing up to the issue of delay in the context of the appellant suffering a forensic disadvantage. As it happened, Mr Doyle did not himself refer to this matter in his address, although of course, he was perfectly entitled to do so (and the judge must then have referred to the argument in the course of summarising the defence case).

The appellant's submissions on the appeal

45Mr Brady of counsel for the appellant submitted that the forensic disadvantages which ought to have been put to the jury by the trial judge concerned the lack of medical evidence, lack of evidence about counselling, aspects of the evidence of Dr Cassimatis, the circumstances of the complainant's attendance at the Consulate, occasions of failed memory and the circumstances of the reconciliation. 

46So far as the medical evidence is concerned, the appellant points to the evidence of the complainant, in respect of count 1, that she was bruised on the public bone, the inside of her thighs, her wrists and upper arms, while the appellant also gave evidence that he noticed some bruising above the pubic bone. The complainant also gave evidence, that following the offence comprising count 2, she went to the toilet and noticed she was bleeding heavily from the anus and said to the appellant that she needed to go to the doctor and might need stitches. This bleeding continued for a few days. The appellant denied that the complainant ever bled from her anus as a result of anal sex. So far as count 3 is concerned, the complainant said that she was seriously injured (""tearing really bad"" in her anus). She also said that this happened during the assault comprising count 4 and that there was heavy bleeding from her anus that went on for over three weeks. Furthermore, the continuing acts of forceful anal intercourse also resulted in anal bleeding, which made the consultation at the Kariong Medical Centre significant. Lastly, counsel referred to the evidence of Ms Buchert that the complainant had told her that she had attended hospital after the first rape and that the hospital had documented her complaint. 

47The appellant contended that the significant forensic disadvantage caused by the lack of any complaint, at least to police or a doctor, was that no independent medical assessment of the injuries that she allegedly suffered was made. Counsel pointed out that whether the complainant bled as she described was relevant not only to the question of aggravation but plainly went to her credibility and the issue of consent, one of the reasons given by her for objecting being the pain that it caused. Of particular significance was the complainant's evidence of attending the Kariong Medical Centre. Her evidence that she had not raised the question of anal rape did not assist the Crown case, of course, but the significance of that omission may well have been greater had there been records kept of the consultation and/or the attending doctor recalled it and, as well, the source of the bleeding (if any) identified.

48In relation to counselling, the evidence of the complainant was that she attended counselling with the appellant but did not disclose the appellant's misconduct. The disadvantage was the inability of the defence to obtain the records of these counselling sessions. There was an enquiry made by the officer in charge of the Relationships Australia (the name, it seems, suggested to police by the complainant although she gave no direct evidence of it) but records are not kept for more than seven years. The officer also searched for a counselling service based upon the description given by the complainant, of where it was, but it could not be located. 

49The next matter identified arose out of the evidence of Dr Cassimatis, whose notes of conversations were not ""all verbatim"" but rather a paraphrase of what was said. The disadvantages identified were not inaccuracies in Dr Cassimatis' notes as a fair (enough) record of what was said but, rather, it being the appellant's case that his admissions to the doctor were lies told because the complainant imposed the condition for reconciliation that he should admit to raping her and one of the factors pointing to the truth of that assertion was Ms Ede's call to Dr Cassimatis at the complainant's instigation. He agreed that he had spoken to Ms Ede and made a note about that conversation dated 28 May 2003 (not part of the exhibited notes), which stated ""He has split up wife, rape accusation from wife"". This was in quotation marks and the doctor said, hence, this was one of the questions asked of him: the phrase ""rape accusation from wife"" meant that Ms Ede told him words to the effect that the appellant's wife was making an accusation of rape. In answer to Mr Doyle, Dr Cassimatis said that she asked several questions, the details of which he could not remember. He said that she talked mostly about the appellant's behaviour and some of his symptoms and his upbringing and father's behaviour, in relation to (as I understand it) whether the doctor thought her brother suffered from Asperger's syndrome. He was asked whether Ms Ede asked him if her brother had admitted any rapes. He said that he did not recall that, but it was quite possible. It is submitted that the fact that Dr Cassimatis could not remember whether Ms Ede had asked him this question was a significant forensic disadvantage to the appellant. 

50In relation to an attendance at the Consulate or Embassy, the appellant submits that there was no real opportunity to obtain independent evidence about whether the complainant had done so and, if so, what she had complained about. It was a significant part of the defence that the complainant did not leave the appellant though she had suffered from his gross misconduct, nor did she seek assistance from friends or the police. The delay in learning of the claimed attendance at the Consulate denied the appellant the means of testing the complainant's evidence that she spoke to someone there ""about domestic violence"". 

51The additional matter relating to failed memory concerned the lack of precision in the evidence of Ms Buchert and Ms Ede about what they were told by the complainant. 

52So far as the alleged reconciliation is concerned, the disadvantage contended for is that the delay in complaint affected the ability to obtain evidence of it and in the inability of the witnesses who stated there was or they believed there was such a reconciliation to recall specific dates. This was important because, it is submitted, the fact of reconciliation supported the appellant's case and contradicted the complainant's evidence. 

The Crown submissions

53The Prosecutor in this Court did not take issue with the appellant's submissions as to the potential disadvantages that had been identified as resulting from delay. Rather, it was contended that these matters had not been brought to the trial judge's attention and, in effect, leave to rely on them should be refused pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Alternatively, defence counsel's address to the jury did not refer to delay or its possible significance in relation to any matter, let alone the matters now relied on and the strength of the Crown case, especially in light of the appellant's admissions to Dr Cassimatis and Sergeant Smith, was such that, if leave were given, the Court should conclude that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice and dismiss the appeal. 

The application of s 165B of the Evidence Act

54Section 165B is in the following terms - 

""(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding in which there is a jury.

(2) If the court, on application by a party, is satisfied that the defendant has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay, the court must inform the jury of the nature of that disadvantage and the need to take that disadvantage into account when considering the evidence.

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in informing the jury of the nature of the significant forensic disadvantage suffered and the need to take that disadvantage into account, but the judge must not in any way suggest to the jury that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict the defendant solely because of the delay or the forensic disadvantage suffered because of the consequences of the delay.

(5) The judge must not warn or inform the jury about any forensic disadvantage the defendant may have suffered because of delay except in accordance with this section, but this section does not affect any other power of the judge to give any warning to, or to inform, the jury.

(6) For the purposes of this section: 

(a) delay includes delay between the alleged offence and its being reported, and

(b) significant forensic disadvantage is not to be regarded as being established by the mere existence of a delay.

(7) For the purposes of this section, the factors that may be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(a) the fact that any potential witnesses have died or are not able to be located,

(b) the fact that any potential evidence has been lost or is otherwise unavailable.""

55It will be seen from subsection 165B(5) that the section is the sole source of a judge's authority either to warn or inform the jury about any forensic disadvantage that a defendant or accused may have suffered because of delay. Of course, this would not prevent a judge from putting these matters to the jury as a part of the defence case if counsel had addressed the jury to that effect. Indeed, there would be a duty to do so. 

56It also appears that the duty arises only on application (as here) by the appellant and thus that the particular significant forensic disadvantage must form part of that application. An accused's lawyers will have obtained instructions as to the issues in the case and, accordingly, be aware how delay had given rise to any particular forensic disadvantage. This is a matter peculiarly within the accused's knowledge or, perhaps more likely, that of his or her legal advisers. For example, if an important witness had died, it could very well seem that the inability to obtain his or her evidence would place the defence at a substantial disadvantage but, if the defence was aware that the witness' evidence would, say, have assisted the prosecution or not assisted the defence, it would not be proper for counsel to rely on the death for the purpose of seeking a warning. Of course, it may be that a judge might think it right to raise particular matters with counsel so that, if they might have been overlooked, the matter could be made right in the interests of a fair trial but I do not think that a trial judge has a duty, as it were, to second guess counsel. 

57This conclusion is similar to that applying to a ""request"" for a warning under s 165 concerning unreliable evidence. Such a request ""would involve counsel making the request identifying what the 'kind' of evidence was, why it was unreasonable, and what the terms of the warning requested were"": Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; (2007) 235 CLR 521; (2007) 82 ALJR 250 per Heydon J at [232]. 

58It seems to me, therefore, that the only matters which could have been considered by the trial judge on the appellant's application were those which were raised by Mr Doyle. The matters he referred to when the question first arose were not the same as those articulated on the second occasion. Perhaps the most significant of these was the inability to obtain medical evidence as to any injury to the complainant which gave rise to the repeated bleeding to which she referred. It is not clear why that matter was not pressed. In my view, however, the judge was entitled - indeed, bound - to act on the basis that the later list (which, after all, was produced after a period of reflection) superseded the former. In the result, the only matters ultimately identified as constituting significant forensic disadvantage arising from delay (with consequent imprecision as to dates) were the appellant's inability to obtain alibi evidence, the impossibility of gathering ""fresh forensic evidence, say blood on sheets"" (emphasis added) and, lastly, the possibility that witnesses ""have perhaps forgotten important exculpatory material"" of which Mr Doyle was unable to give an example. 

59The trial judge, in referring to the appellant's awareness of the complainant's complaint, at least in respect of count 1, from the very beginning, cited R v WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427, and quoted a passage from Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law, 9th ed, (2010) Thomson Reuters at [1.4.3200] - 

""Of course, very long delay will not always lead to a conclusion of significant forensic disadvantage. For example, an initial complaint may have been brought to the attention of the defendant soon after the relevant events, notwithstanding the fact that the police were not informed for many years, so that no forensic disadvantage was caused to the defendant."" 

For which proposition R v WSP (supra) at [151] - [158] is cited. 

60WSP was a case in which it was common ground that, shortly after the alleged offences were said to have occurred, the complainant made some complaint in a family context which was brought to the appellant's attention. When the trial judge raised the question whether there had been any significant loss of the means of testing the complainant's allegations flowing from the delay (of some 13 years) in charging the appellant, his counsel said that he did not make such a submission. The complaint to the police was the first occasion when the appellant (as Spigelman CJ characterised it at [30]) ""was first required to answer the allegations in a forensic context"". Spigelman CJ continued - 

""Clearly, this delay is within the scope of the circumstances in which a Longman [v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79] warning has come to be required. It is the forensic disadvantage to which the warning is directed"". 

R S Hulme J (with whom Sully J agreed) considered that the period between the first, early informal complaint and the time of complaint to the police was so extensive as to have required a Longman warning. 

61WSP is therefore not authority for the proposition that, where an early informal complaint is made, the fact that there is a significant delay before the alleged offender is confronted with the complaints by the police is irrelevant. The significance of delay will plainly always be a matter of fact and degree and whether a warning should be given will depend upon whether a significant forensic disadvantage has been identified. If it has been identified then it is clear that the warning ought to be given, simply because it is or can be a very important factor to be taken into account when assessing the respective prosecution and defence cases and its importance may not be appreciated by the jury. The fundamental question is whether there has been a significant forensic disadvantage, which will depend on the nature of the complaint and the extent of the delay in the circumstances of the particular case. The extent of delay is not the test. Rather, it is the consequence of delay which is decisive. The focus on the length of delay has, I think, arisen because of the notion of presumptive prejudice, especially as to reliability of recollection, which was earlier regarded as giving rise to the need for a warning. 

62Accordingly, the trial judge's dismissal of the significance of the delay in reporting the alleged misconduct to the police because the complainant immediately complained to the appellant about his misconduct is, with respect, an error of law. However, this does not dispose of the matter. As I explain below, the matters ultimately identified by the counsel for the appellant at trial did not identify any forensic disadvantage which could fairly be regarded as significant.

Were significant forensic disadvantages identified? 

63I return, therefore, to the particular matters identified in the written submission provided at the trial judge's request. Given that the appellant did not deny anal intercourse, so that the sole issue was consent, the question of an alibi simply did not arise. The proposed fresh forensic evidence, such as blood on the sheets, which might have been able to be collected if complaint had been immediately made to the police, on its face might have created a significant forensic disadvantage. The defence case could only be assisted if (there being no staining) this was inconsistent with the complainant's evidence. The complainant was not cross-examined as to whether the sheets were stained. As the evidence stood, therefore, there was no significant forensic disadvantage demonstrated by the appellant being unable to procure an examination of the bedding. Lastly, the mere reference to difficulties of recollection without specifying the particular witness and the significance of the problem with memory did not give rise to the need to direct the jury about this matter. 

64Some discussion, I think, is appropriate about the matters first raised by Mr Doyle for the appellant when the subject was initially broached by his Honour. As I have already said, the first matter (concerning semen) was immaterial. However, the ability to obtain medical evidence about anal injury or bleeding, either from the records of Kariong Medical Centre or from the doctor seen by the complainant, was certainly capable of giving rise to a significant forensic disadvantage. The same applies to the inability to obtain medical records of the visit (denied by the complainant but said by her sister as having been stated by her), which was, at least prima facie, capable of amounting to a significant forensic disadvantage. However, counsel's submission on this matter relied on ""the effluxion of time... [meaning] that it's highly unlikely that those records will still exist."" It seems to me (though it is not necessary to decide) that this merely speculative possibility as to the availability of records made it difficult, if not impossible, for this submission to succeed. Where the proposed significant forensic disadvantage comprises loss or unavailability of evidence, it will be necessary in most cases to establish that this is in fact the case rather than leaving it to supposition. The third matter relied on was that, had there been an immediate complaint about the first incident, then some evidence would have been likely to have been forthcoming - at least from police sources - as to the presence of bruising. This contention is weakened somewhat by the fact that, in 2001, the appellant told Dr Cassimatis that in ""1993 maybe he forced himself on his wife and bruised [her], he unaware of the force."" On 4 June 2003 Dr Cassimatis noted, ""He agrees he raped wife years ago, but knows he bruised her and present one week later"". Accordingly, the potential evidence would, on the appellant's account to Dr Cassimatis, show that indeed the complainant was bruised as a result of his ""forceful"" intercourse. (I have already mentioned the additional complication that the appellant conceded in his evidence the presence of bruises, though not on the arms.) In the result, the only matter which, had it been pressed, would have required an appropriate warning to the jury, was that relating to the visit of the complainant to the Kariong Medical Centre and, possibly, the absence of hospital records. However, for the reasons I have given, in light of the way in which the application was ultimately made, no occasion for a direction in relation to these matters arose.

The application of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules

65So far as the additional matters contended on the appeal as amounting to significant forensic disadvantage are concerned, it is necessary to obtain leave to rely on them at this stage: r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Were the question not governed by s 165B(2) and (5), these matters, or at least some of them, were of sufficient moment to have been required to be the subject of a warning, even though no direction was sought in respect of them and I would have granted leave to raise them on the appeal. However, since they were not raised below and, hence, could not have been the subject of directions, leave must be refused. 

Conclusion

66I propose that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be dismissed. 

67BUTTON J: I agree with Adams J.

Relevant Facts

6As previously indicated, a Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered in these proceedings and, for the purposes of these sentencing proceedings the facts as I state them have been derived from those Agreed Facts.

7In the early afternoon of Sunday 22 August 2010 the offender Gavin Bell attended the Kingswood Hotel to meet with Gary Markham for the purpose of discussing a plan to steal money and cannabis from a house at Werrington. During the meeting the offender, Gavin Bell showed Markham a .22 calibre sawn-off rifle. 

8The two made arrangements to meet later that evening for the purposes of carrying out the offence. 

9At about 8.00pm Markham picked the offender up from an address at Kingswood. Together they returned to the home of Markham at Somerset Street Kingswood to wait for a third man who the offender said was also going to take part in the robbery. Bell, the offender, was dressed in dark clothing and had with him a set of woollen black gloves, a pen gun, a balaclava and the firearm that he had shown Markham at the hotel earlier in the afternoon. 

10At different times during the course of the evening the offender used Markham's mobile phone to make inquiries about the third co-offender's whereabouts. 

11At about 9.15pm Bell again telephoned the co-offender using Markham's mobile phone. After this phone call Markham drove the offender to an address where they met their co-offender. The co-offender showed Markham and Bell a small .25 calibre pistol, balaclavas and a Taser which looked like a mobile phone. 

12At about 9.45pm the offender and Markham left with the co-offender in a car driven by the co-offender. The offender was carrying the sawn-off rifle in a hessian bag, and was wearing black clothes and black woollen gloves. The offender was also in possession of a pen gun. The third offender was also dressed in dark clothes and was in possession of the small pistol and the Taser. 

13During the drive to Werrington the offender told Markham that he knew of the premises they were proposing to rob through his younger brother Blake Mangion. The offender, Bell, and the co-offender offered Markham the use of the pen gun, a Taser and balaclava. 

14At Werrington the vehicle was parked on Irwin street which is a street running behind Princess Street and beside a park. 

15The offender was armed with the .22 Calibre sawn-off rifle whilst the third offender was armed with the small .25 calibre pistol. Both offenders wore balaclavas.

16The offender and the co-offender went to the front door of Princess Street. 

17Bell and the co-offender used a garden tool to force open the security door of the premises. Once they opened the security/screen door, the offender kicked open the locked wooden door of the home which made a large banging sound as it impacted with the front interior wall of the home. 

18The home at that address was the rented family home of the Leuthwaite family. Robert Leuthwaite Senior was watching television with his wife Sylvia Dawn Leuthwaite in a room at the rear of the house. Robert Leuthwaite Junior, his partner Amy O'Neil and their child Jamie Lee Leuthwaite aged 21 months were in the master bedroom of the house. The deceased Devril Leuthwaite, who was 17 years old, and his girlfriend Eliza Ball were in the second bedroom of the house. 

19Robert Leuthwaite Senior heard the loud bang made by the front door and walked towards the front of the house to investigate. In the kitchen he was confronted by two armed intruders. They grabbed hold of Robert Leuthwaite Senior and said ""We want you to come here"". They both grabbed him by his jumper and attempted to force him into the hallway of the home. Mr Leuthwaite Senior managed to wrestle out of his jumper and ran away from the two offenders, taking his wife from the house and escaping into the backyard of the premises. 

20Robert Leuthwaite Junior had also heard the bang of the front door. He opened his bedroom door and saw the two men in the hallway. Robert Leuthwaite Junior called out to his brother Devril Leuthwaite that someone was in the house. Robert Leuthwaite Junior closed the door to his bedroom and instructed his girlfriend to stay in the room. 

21Robert Leuthwaite Junior left his bedroom via a window and jumped around on to the front verandah of the home. As he did so he observed a man standing in the front garden. On the Crown's case this man was Gary Markham. 

22Robert Leuthwaite Junior ran from the front door into the hallway where his brother Devril was fighting the two intruders. Robert Leuthwaite Junior grabbed the smaller of the two intruders and began to try and propel him down the hallway and out of the house. 

23Devril Leuthwaite wrestled with Bell on the front verandah of the home. 

24Robert Leuthwaite Junior forced the smaller of the two offenders out on to the railing on the front verandah of the home where they continued to struggle. The offender and Devril Leuthwaite continued struggling on to the front lawn of the premises. 

25The co-offender then fired three shots from the .25 calibre pistol he was holding. One shot impacted with the cheek of Bell passing through his mouth and damaging several teeth. One shot hit the victim, Robert Leuthwaite Junior, in the chest. 

26The offender pointed the sawn-off rifle at the deceased and fired one shot. This shot hit Devril Leuthwaite in the chest. This shot was discharged after Bell had been accidentally shot by the co-offender. 

27The three offenders then ran from the premises through the park towards their vehicle parked in Irwin Street. Markham left behind a shoe that he had been wearing. The offender left behind the woollen glove that he had removed prior to shooting the deceased. 

28Robert Leuthwaite Junior was transported to the Nepean Hospital where he spent some time in the Intensive Care Unit being treated for a gunshot wound to his chest. A single .25 calibre projective was recovered from his body during surgery. 

29A post mortem examination of the deceased Devril Leuthwaite found that the direct cause of death was a gun shot wound to the chest which perforated the right lung. A single .22 calibre projectile was recovered from his body. 

30The offender was arrested and charged on 25 August 2010. 

31The Crown case against the offender, Gavin Bell, is that he went into the premises at Princess Street, Werrington in company with the other offender and Markham armed with a firearm with the intention of committing armed robbery. During the commission of this serious indictable offence punishable by 25 years imprisonment the offender discharged his firearm at the deceased Devril Leuthwaite, causing his death. 

32During the commission of the armed robbery the victim, Robert Leuthwaite Junior, was shot in the chest by the other offender. The possibility of the offender using his firearm during the commission of the offence with intent to the cause grievous bodily harm was within contemplation.

Evidence Tendered by the Crown: Exhibit A

33The criminal history of the offender establishes a number of matters for which he was dealt with as a juvenile by the Cobham Children's Court commencing on 28 June 2000. The most serious offence, prior to the subject offences, was dealt with on 2 June 2005 by the Penrith District Court in respect of an offence of robbery in company for which the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing 30 November 2004, which included an 18-month non-parole period. I note that the criminal record in respect of that offence recorded that parole was to: ""... include drug and alcohol counselling ..."".

34The offender was dealt with on two occasions in 2008 by the Penrith Local Court in relation to offences of possess prohibited drug, for which he received a s 9 bond, and a fine for an offence of behave in an offensive manner in or near a public place/school.

35On 8 December 2009 he was dealt with by the Penrith Local Court for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was sentenced to imprisonment of 3 months.

36In his oral submissions, Mr Ainsworth on behalf of the offender noted that the psychologist's report indicates that the offender acquired a heroin addiction whilst a juvenile and that he received a number of juvenile sentences. However, it was submitted, he had not come to the attention of the criminal justice system as an adult in a manner that suggested that the offences the subject of the present proceedings were necessarily an indication of his general criminality. Mr Ainsworth observed that the only significant adult offence recorded in the criminal history was the robbery in company offence to which I have referred.

37I will refer to the history obtained by Ms Panagiotopoulos for the purpose of her assessment shortly.

The Offender's Affidavit Evidence

38The offender is presently aged 27 years. He was born in Sydney. He left school at about 14 years of age. He found learning at school to be difficult.

39The affidavit was read at the sentence hearing. The Crown did not cross-examine the offender on the affidavit. In it, the offender referred to details concerning his personal background and additionally expressed his remorse for the subject offences and his regret at the stress and harm he has caused to the victims and victims' family.

40In his affidavit he stated that he began smoking cannabis at an early age and by about 12 years he was smoking it on a weekly basis. He said at age 14 he first began using heroin and by 16 years he started using ""ice"" as well as Xanax and Valium.

41He said he, at an unspecified time, completed a TAFE course - a glazier's course and a Bricklayer's course.

42In paragraph 9 of his affidavit, he stated that as he got older his substance abuse caused many problems he encountered. 

43I will refer to other matters addressed in his affidavit shortly.

The Psychological Assessment Report

44The psychological assessment report of Ms Panagiotopoulos identifies the materials that were made available to her (which included a copy of the Agreed Facts). She conducted her assessment of the offender at Long Bay Hospital on 12 September 2013, the interview and assessment lasting just over three hours on that date.

45Ms Panagiotopoulos also interviewed the offender's mother by telephone on 16 September 2013.

46The family background includes the separation of the offender's parents when the offender was approximately 2-3 years of age. I note that there was no history of any discord between the offender's mother and stepfather, nor of domestic strife in the nature of violence or sexual/physical abuse or neglect.

47In the history recorded in the report it would appear that the offender's upbringing was relatively stable but that at a reasonably early age he engaged in drug use and delinquent behaviours with periods spent in juvenile detention centres.

48According to the history received by the psychologist, he left school at the start of year 8 of high school and it appears that his dislike of school was at least in part related to learning difficulties experienced.

49Subsequently, he had limited vocational experience and developed relationships with anti-social peers associated with drug taking and other criminal activities.

50The history obtained by Ms Panagiotopoulos as set out in her report, is that the offender commenced cannabis use at the age of 9 or 10, and between the age of 14 and 17 he engaged in using heroin and amphetamines, and methamphetamines (ice). In due course, according to his account to the psychologist, he commenced to use such drugs in combination described as a pattern of binge use.

51In relation to the subject offences, the offender gave an account during the psychological assessment of being at the time homeless, cashless and heavily drug dependent, and in need of drugs. The psychological assessment report refers to the offender's expressions of regret about the outcome of the offences and about the death of Devril Leuthwaite. The report additionally records his expressions of sorrow for people who have been affected by his offending, including his victims and their family as well as his own family.

52On the basis of psychometric and other assessment, Ms Panagiotopoulos concluded that the offender falls in the average range in terms of general intellectual functioning, that his capacity to read written English is commensurate with the skills of the average 13 and a half-year old, but that he is functionally literate and attained a level of literacy capacity consistent with his educational attainment.

53Ms Panagiotopoulos concluded:

""Clinically, Mr Bell endorsed a high level of antisocial personality characteristics including being egocentric, aggressive, disloyal, unreliable, irresponsible, impulsive, and reckless. These personality characteristics are likely to compromise his ability to have social relationships both in friendships and intimacy. There was also a frank account of his drug abuse history, which has led to severe impairments in his ability to maintain his social role expectations, and possibly has alienated people who were once close to him ..."". (at [37])

54The report also noted that the offender's profile indicated ""a significantly high level of depressive symptoms ..."". (at [37])

55By way of conclusion, Ms Panagiotopoulos stated:

""Mr Bell's profile and endorsed characteristics most likely point towards a diagnoses of Antisocial Personality Disorder and this would be consistent with his reported history. However, there is also some evidence [that] Mr Bell may have co-morbid Dysthymic Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms ..."" (at [38])

56The report also noted that the offender's ""offending behaviour is best conceptualised within the context of antisocial and maladapted personality functioning, further disrupted by severe substance abuse disorder, homelessness and poor consequential thinking."" (at [41])

57On page 9 of the report, a number of specific recommendations are made for the necessary support and intervention for the offender, in a number of areas. These recommendations were expressed as addressing the offender's criminogenic needs and to ameliorate his risk to the community.

58There are two other matters to be observed from Ms Panagiotopoulos' report. First, whilst it is clear that the offender has had problems with addiction to prohibited and other drugs, there is no analysis suggesting any particular causal nexus between his offending, the subject of the present proceedings, and any drug addiction at the material time. Second, there is no material that links any personality behavioural disorders to a deprived upbringing.

Crown Submissions

59In its written submissions the Crown noted that the offender was 24 years of age at the time of the subject offences. The Crown submitted that his history of previous offences disentitles him to leniency he might otherwise receive. I accept that submission.

60The Crown accepted that the offender's pleas entered at a late stage should attract a discount in the order of 10%.

61In its helpful submissions, the Crown submitted in relation to the offence of murder:

1. The offence was committed by the offender's deliberate act of discharging the loaded firearm he was carrying at the deceased during or immediately after the commission of the foundational offence of assault with intent to rob (Count 2).

2. That there is prescribed a standard non-parole period of 25 years where the victim is a child ie, is under the age of 18 years, and that the standard non-parole period is to be considered as an important guidepost as to the seriousness of the offence, notwithstanding the offender's plea of guilty.

3. That the Court of Criminal Appeal has confirmed that constructive murder is not to be regarded as less serious attracting a lighter sentence or non-parole period than that which is appropriate for other categories of murder R v Jacobs (2004) 151 A Crim R 452 at [332] and R v Mills (Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 April 1995, Gleeson CJ, Cole JA and Sperling J, unreported, No 60306 of 1994).

4. That in accordance with authority, in particular R v Raad [2011] NSWCCA 138 the relative seriousness of any crime depends on its own facts and not upon some general categorisation per Adams J at [12].

5. The present case is an objectively serious case of felony murder. In particular in that respect this is a case where the offender killed the deceased in his own home by intentionally firing a loaded firearm he had brought to the deceased's home, in company with another armed co-offender to effect the armed robbery of the deceased's home.

6. The foundational offence, assault with intent to rob, is an objectively serious example of armed home invasion. Whilst the offender did not intend to cause death or grievous bodily harm, he must have realised that, with the safety catch off and his finger on the trigger, serious injury, if not death, was a reasonable possibility.

7. The latter offence was aggravated by being committed without regard for public safety: s 21A(2)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 there being a number of persons present in the house at the time of the offence.

8. As to Count 2, aggravated assault with intent to rob Robert Leuthwaite Senior, the offender's plea was entered on the basis of his joint and primary criminal liability with his co-offender. It is a foundational offence to the count for murder. The aggravating circumstance was that it was committed in company.

9. As to Count 3, cause grievous bodily harm to Robert Leuthwaite Junior with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. There are two aggravating circumstances. First, by the actual use of a weapon: s 21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Second, the offence being committed in company: s 21A(2)(e).

62The Crown submitted that there is little by way of parity between the offender's co-offender Markham and the offender and there should be appropriate disparity between their sentences. I accept that submission.

63Mr Ainsworth properly did not take issue with this latter submission and I proceed upon that basis.

64In oral submissions the learned Crown Prosecutor submitted that on the agreed facts the offender was the ""prime mover"" closely followed by Markham (T 8), but that in that respect the Crown emphasised that the offender was the prime mover in relation to the robbery offence, the murder not being the point of the planned joint enterprise between the offenders: T 9.

65Whilst Mr Ainsworth submitted that the offender could not be regarded as the prime mover, I consider that the Agreed Facts support the Crown's submission on this point.

66In relation to the circumstances in relation to the offence of murder in which the offender fired the fatal shot, the Crown observed that the shot was discharged after the offender had been shot in the face by his co-offender, that is, some seconds beforehand: T 10.

67The Crown further submitted that in those circumstances a finding would not be made of an intent to kill but a lesser intent to inflict injury for the purpose of effecting an escape.

68Mr Ainsworth in his submission observed:

(i) The facts were always that this was a constructive murder rather than a deliberate intent to do grievous bodily harm or to kill. That is the basis on which the plea was entered.

(ii) He did not cavil with the analysis that I referred to at the sentence hearing that there is a need to step back and determine the objective seriousness of the entire event bearing in mind it is a constructive murder offence and flowing from the foundational offence, armed robbery in company. 

(iii) The tragic and catastrophic consequence of the discharge of the gun must be seen in conjunction or in light of the struggle that then occurred in the course of what, at that stage, appeared as an aborted attempt at robbery of these premises. 

(iv) In the course of resistance by members of the household, the co-offender fired a number of shots in the course of the struggle, one of which hit Mr Bell in the face. That was at very close range and the other shots that were fired that hit the surviving Leuthwaite brother were always at very close range to Mr Bell.

(v) It is only after the bullet struck the offender and passed through the side of his face, that he discharged the firearm. Mr Ainsworth accepted that it was a deliberate act to pull the trigger.

69Mr Ainsworth properly acknowledged in relation to the offence of murder:

""It is plainly and objectively a very serious offence on the facts of it but it is the unfortunate 2013 fact that armed robberies or robberies or run ins, call them what you may, people like Mr Bell and whoever his co-offenders were, other than Markham who are drug addicted and/or in need of funds who target persons that they believe will have money or drugs.""

70On the issue of accumulation of sentences, Mr Ainsworth submitted that some accumulation may be considered in relation to the offence of murder but there should not be any accumulation of sentences in respect of the other offences: T 14. Whilst there were separate victims in relation to Counts 2 and 3, they arose in the course of one event.

Sentencing Considerations

71In determining the sentences to be imposed on the offender I am required to determine the appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider the issues of accumulation or concurrency of sentences to be imposed and questions of totality: Pearce v R (1998) HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.

72Each of Counts 1, 2 and 3 are objectively serious offences in terms of the individual acts of the offender giving rise to each offence and the circumstances in which they occurred.

73The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment. The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 25 years where the victim is a child (defined as under 18 years of age). The deceased, Devril Leuthwaite, at the time of the offence committed by the offender was 17 years and 9 months, his date of birth having been 17 November 1992.

74The offender pleaded guilty to the offence of murder (Count 1) upon the basis that his conduct amounted to what formerly was known as ""felony-murder"" and is now usually referred to as ""constructive murder"". That offence was committed during or immediately after the foundational crime the subject of Count 2. The offence the subject of Count 3, that of causing grievous bodily harm to Robert Leuthwaite Junior with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm is also a very serious offence being one as I have earlier stated carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.

75The Crown accepted that constructive murder is an acceptable basis to approach the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence in Count 1. The Crown, however, has submitted that the offence of murder in this case on that basis is objectively serious having regard to several factors referred to in the Crown's submissions. Counsel for the Crown, and Mr Ainsworth, accepted that the fact that the offence arose in the course of the commission of the foundational offences is not of itself a mitigating factor and nor is the offender's culpability reduced on that account: R v Mills (NSWCCA, 3 April 1995, unreported).

76I accept that it is appropriate in this matter to proceed on the basis that the offence is properly to be regarded as one of constructive murder. I have so concluded after considering all of the material that has been placed before me during the course of the sentencing proceedings.

77The fact that an offence of murder which is characterised as ""constructive murder"", does not, for that reason alone, dictate the conclusion that a lower level of culpability is involved than applies to other categories of murder. This conclusion flows from the principles as stated in Mills to which I have referred. The seriousness of any particular constructive murder is to be assessed according to ""the nature of the acts of the offenders which played a part in the death of the victim"": R v JB; R v RJH (1999) NSWCCA 93 at [33].

78Counts 2 and 3 were committed in the home of the Leuthwaite family on a Sunday evening and involved an outrageous course of conduct arising out of a planned home invasion in which the offender took a lead role. The motivation was personal gain in terms of money and drugs. The offence of murder, on the agreed facts, arose in circumstances in which having encountered strong resistance by members of the Leuthwaite family, in particular the deceased, 17 year old Devril Leuthwaite, the offender resorted to the use of a loaded firearm to overcome the resistance against him rather than extricating himself in some other way from the situation which he and his co-offenders themselves had created.

79The circumstances in which the offender invaded the dwelling house armed with a loaded sawn-off rifle were directly associated with the subsequent shooting of the deceased for reasons identified in the Crown's submissions. The offender and his co-offenders were wholly responsible for having created a dangerous risk to the occupants of the dwelling which risk tragically materialised in the killing of a young man on the threshold of his adult life. Cases such as this, involving the taking of human life in the pursuit of criminal self-interest have no place in a civilised society and are deserving of severe punishment.

80In determining the sentences to be imposed for each of the offences, the personal circumstances of the offender must be taken into account, and I do. He plainly has had long-standing personal problems including a problem with aggression, drug-taking and has over many years manifested anti-social personality characteristics as identified in the psychological assessment that has been undertaken. This is not a case in which his antisocial personality disorder has, as I have earlier indicated, been specifically linked to any abusive or deprived upbringing. Ms Panagiotopoulos has made a number of recommendations for support and intervention programs in a number of areas whilst the offender is serving the sentences to be imposed. It is to be hoped that her recommendations will be capable of being followed or implemented.

81On the basis of her report, the offender's rehabilitation prospects must, in my assessment, be considered to be quite uncertain. Much may depend upon whether he can benefit from the type of support programs that have been recommended.

82The offender has expressed contrition and remorse both in his affidavit and to the psychologist. I am prepared to act upon the basis that his contrition and remorse are genuine.

83He is entitled in the determination of sentences to be imposed to a 10% discount for his guilty pleas and I proceed upon that basis.

84There is no basis, in my assessment, for a finding of special circumstances in determining the appropriate proportion between non-parole and parole periods in relation to the sentences to be imposed.

85I have considered the principles of totality in determining concurrence and an accumulation of sentences. In that respect, the fact that the individual offences occurred as part of or in the course of one episode is not determinative. The particular circumstances of each offence were objectively serious and they each included different victims.

86In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed, in particular in relation to the offence of murder, sentences imposed in other cases may, to a point, assist in illustrating a range and can provide assistance against which to examine a proposed sentence, but they are not to be used arithmetically to determine the particular sentence under consideration: Raad v R [2011] NSWCCA 138. On that basis I have considered the sentencing approach and outcomes in a number of cases including R v Jacobs [2004] 151 A Crim R 452; Hudd v R [2013] NSWCCA 57; Brown v R [2006] NSWCCA 395; R v Thompson [2011] NSWSC 1130; R v Nguyen [2007] NSWSC 389.

Consideration

Objective Seriousness

87The sentence to be imposed in respect of Count 1, the offence of murder, is to be set by bearing in mind in the sense ascribed by the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39 as a guidepost: Foster v R [2011] NSWCCA 285 at [28]-[31]; R v Koloamatungi [2011] NSWCCA 288 [15]-[21] per Basten JA. See also the recent amendments in Schedule 1 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Non-Parole Periods) Bill, 2013 assented to on 29 October 2013, s 54B.

88I have had regard to the standard non-parole period in relation to Counts 1 and 3 in accordance with those principles and provisions.

89The sentence I propose to impose for the offence of murder will provide a non-parole that is below the standard non-parole period having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the objective circumstances of the commission of the offence in Count 1, in particular those referred to in para [66] above together with the fact that the offender did not form an intent to actually use the sawn-off rifle until the circumstances arose as they did very shortly before the fatal shot was fired by him.

Victim Impact Statements

90Each of the Victim Impact Statements of Sylvia Dawn Leuthwaite, Robert Leuthwaite Senior, Robert Leuthwaite Junior, Sylvia Leuthwaite, Amanda Richardson (nee Leuthwaite) and Leeanne Leuthwaite were all read at the sentencing hearing. The statements indicate the enormous loss and grief suffered by members of Devril Leuthwaite's family. It is to be hoped that the opportunity that was taken up by those who have made the Victim Impact Statements of expressing their deep sorrow for the loss of their beloved family member will give some solace and relief to the members of the deceased's family. I am, of course, obliged by existing authority not to take these matters into account in the assessment of the appropriate sentences to be imposed: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; and Bollen v R (1998) 99 A Crim R 510.

Sentences

91In determining sentence, a discount of 10% for the offender's early pleas is, as I have earlier stated, to be applied.

92In relation to Count 1, the offence of murder, after allowance of a 10% discount, the non-parole period will be for a period of 19 years with a balance of term of 6 years and 4 months.

93I note that in respect of Count 1, the total term of the sentence, prior to the application of the 10% discount is 28 years 2 months.

94Gavin Anthony Bell I sentence you to the following terms of imprisonment:

(i) In respect of Count 3, cause grievous bodily harm to Robert Leuthwaite (Junior) with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months commencing on 25 August 2010 and expiring on 24 February 2018, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 25 February 2018 and expiring on 24 August 2020.

(ii) In respect of Count 2, aggravated assault of Robert Leuthwaite (Senior) with intent to rob, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 25 February 2011 and to expire on 24 November 2014, together with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 25 November 2014 and expiring on 24 February 2016.

(iii) In respect of Count 1, murder of Devril Leuthwaite, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 19 years, commencing on 25 February 2013 and expiring on 24 February 2032 on which date you will be eligible for release on parole together with a balance of term of 6 years and 4 months commencing on 25 February 2032 and expiring on 24 June 2038.

95The total effective non-parole period in respect of the sentences which I have now imposed in respect of Counts 1, 2 and 3 is a period of 21 years and 6 months, with a balance of term of 6 years and 4 months.

		13 December 2013",2013-10-31 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762637,James v R [2013] NSWCCA 272,"Judgment OF THE COURT

1The applicant sought leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 4 November 2011 after a jury convicted him of 16 offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) relating to the possession and transmission of multiple images and multimedia files of child pornography or child abuse material. He was also convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code Act of using a carriage service to cause offence. He was convicted on a total of 17 counts.

2In the hearing of the application the applicant relied on three grounds as follows.
(1)The sentencing judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of counts 1 to 15 as being in the mid range of seriousness.
(2)The sentencing judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of count 17 as being within the mid range of objective seriousness.
(3)The head sentences and non-parole periods were manifestly excessive.

3In relation to ground 1, which rather subsumed the argument in relation to the others, the applicant submitted that, although the sentencing judge adopted the approach of imposing individual sentences for each of the 15 offences, he did so referable to the number of child pornography files transmitted, irrespective of whether they were images or multimedia files. It was submitted that the sentencing judge thereby failed to take into account a factor relevant to an assessment of objective seriousness of offences of the relevant kind.

4It was accepted in argument that the evidence led on sentence, while in all other respects comprehensive, did not allow for any factual findings of that specific kind to be made, since the actual content of relevant files was not in evidence. The sentencing judge expressly observed that, while he had information about how many images were transmitted in respect to each offence, he did not have information about the range of categories over which those images were spread so far as each individual offence was concerned.

5It is difficult to see how a finding of mid-range offending could be made without that evidence. However, it does not necessarily follow that the individual sentences are infected with error for that reason or that without that evidence a finding of low-range offending was mandated.

6The Court has concluded that the graduated individual sentences imposed for the transmission offences, in the absence of any evidence as to the content of the files transmitted in each count, are suggestive of error. Thus, the individual sentences, or at least some of them, appear to be excessive. Because of the accumulation of one month over each of the transmission offences, an excessive sentence on one of the transmission counts might have had an effect on the total sentence imposed. A re-sentencing exercise may be warranted for that reason, the more so if the error infected all of the transmission counts.

7It was agreed at the conclusion of argument that, were the Court to reach a concluded view that the sentences for the transmission offences were suggestive of error, the Court may not ultimately be called upon to re-sentence if, after further consideration of the available evidence, the applicant elected to lead no further evidence on re-sentence to establish error.

8We have formed the view that the sentences for the transmission offences are indeed suggestive of error. Accordingly, the appropriate course would be for the applicant to be given the opportunity to decide whether to adduce further evidence on re-sentencing. If, however, no further evidence were to be adduced to demonstrate error, the application would be dismissed.

9The applicant accordingly will be directed to notify the Registrar and the Crown no later than 15 November 2013 whether he proposes to adduce further evidence on re-sentencing. The application will then be listed for further directions on a date convenient to the parties. The parties may approach speak either the Registrar or the Associate to Fullerton J to fix a date for a further mention after 15 November 2013.

2762642,R v Corrie LOVERIDGE; R v AB [2013] NSWSC 1591,"Judgment

Introduction

1In the early hours of 1 December 2010 Alan Ray Gordon, then aged 17 years and 5 months was stabbed to death by Corrie Loveridge and AB. Loveridge was convicted of murder following a trial, whilst AB was convicted of murder following his plea of guilty. Each offender is liable to imprisonment for life. The standard non-parole period of 25 years applies in Loveridge's case, since he was just over the age of 18 years at the time but not to AB, since he was then aged 17 years and 6 months. 

2Each offender also pleaded guilty to breaking and entering a dwelling house, intending to steal from it. Serious injury was inflicted on the occupier of the premises, Mrs Elena Parrelli. Loveridge also pleaded guilty to an associated charge of robbing Mrs Parrelli of a wristwatch and a colour television, inflicting grievous bodily harm upon her at the time. Loveridge pleaded guilty to specially aggravated break and enter, the circumstances of special aggravation being the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm. Loveridge's offences respectively carry maximum terms of imprisonment of 25 years imprisonment the latter having a standard non-parole period of 7 years. On the other hand AB pleaded guilty to aggravated break and enter, the aggravation being the fact that actual bodily harm was intentionally or recklessly inflicted. This carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. Obviously, the ordinary principles of joint responsibility apply. The agreed facts were that Loveridge alone struck Mrs Parrelli. Since by his plea AB admitted to having committed the break and enter offence ""in circumstances of aggravation"" and the particulars were ""actual bodily harm was inflicted"", it follows that he admitted that actual bodily harm was committed in the circumstances specified in para 105A(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1900, although not by his own act, as distinct from being Loveridge's accomplice, and although recklessness or intention were not expressly mentioned. Mr Stratton SC for AB agreed that this was the sense in which the indictment and AB's plea should be understood.

3Loveridge also pleaded guilty to a charge of recruiting a 15 year old child, in substance, to procure a third person to inflict actual bodily harm to Billy Bray. He believed Bray had informed on him to police. This offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. He also pleaded guilty to an offence of attempting to dissuade two witnesses from giving evidence. This offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment for 7 years. 

4AB also pleaded guilty to an offence of intimidating a person with the intention of causing her to fear physical or mental harm, an offence under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment or 50 penalty units or both and requested the Court to take into account an offence of using the postal service to threaten the infliction of serious harm, arising from a letter written by AB between 17 December 2010 and 26 January 2011 which was intercepted by staff at the Kariong Correctional Centre where he was being held. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. 

The breaking and entering 

5The material facts were subject of an agreed statement, from which the following account is largely taken. 

6On the evening of 30 November 2010 and early hours of 1 December 2010, AB and Loveridge were at premises in Tobruk Street, North St Marys with a number of other persons. Over the course of the night Loveridge and AB consumed wine, smoked some marijuana and had used the drug ice. Sometime after 1.00am they decided to break into a nearby residence in Oleander Road. Loveridge was armed with a knife. The offenders jumped over the back fence and opened the rear screen door and rear door of the house, which had been shut but not locked. They started to search the house for items to steal. The house was occupied by a Mrs Parrelli who was 87 years old and lived there alone. She was in her bed asleep but, hearing a noise, got up. She put the light on and, seeing the back door open went to close it. She was using a walking stick. She saw the offenders inside her house. Loveridge grabbed the walking stick from her and hit Mrs Parrelli several times over the head and body, causing her to fall to the ground. Mrs Parrelli activated her Vitalcall, which is a device for transmitting stress calls to a monitoring centre. The call and the ensuing interchange between Mrs Parrelli and the offenders was recorded. The offenders screamed horrific threats of inflicting appalling injuries if Mrs Parrelli did not produce the money they demanded. After perhaps two minutes, the offenders left, taking with them a colour television set and Mrs Parrelli's wristwatch, taken from her wrist. The episode must have been a terrifying, as well as an extremely painful, experience. Loveridge dropped his knife in the garden as they left. Mrs Parrelli remained in hospital as a result of the assaults upon her for some 22 days. 

7On 2 December 2010 police discovered Mrs Parrelli's television at the Tobruk Street premises. Loveridge told police after his arrest that he knew the house and knew that Mrs Parrelli lived there. AB knew that the house was occupied by a grandmother of one of Loveridge's friends. AB, in his interview with police, admitted to breaking into the premises through the rear door and seeing Mrs Parrelli but denied assaulting or going near her. In a letter from gaol AB admitted he committed a home invasion and said that he felt ""Sorry for the lady"". I accept that it was Loveridge who struck Mrs Parrelli but it is obvious from the recording that AB was, in every important sense, his accomplice. So far as the objective seriousness of this offence is concerned, there is no realistic distinction to be made between them. 

The murder of Alan Gordon

8AB made an agreed statement of facts (referred to as the statement) concerning this offence. This material is not evidence against Loveridge. So far as he is concerned, the facts as to his involvement in the offence are derived from the evidence in the trial. It is accepted that adverse conclusions require satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. 

9After having committed the break and enter at Oleander Road, the offenders returned to Tobruk Street, leaving the premises shortly before 3.00am to go to a nearby service station. In his statement AB says that earlier that night he was agitated and said, ""I am going to fucken kill cunts"". He stated that he and Loveridge were armed with kitchen knives. So far as Loveridge is concerned, I am satisfied (for reasons explained below) that he also took a knife with him, having collected another from the Tobruk Street premises. About 10 minutes after they left Tobruk Street, the offenders entered the service station. AB used the ATM to withdraw cash and purchase some food items. As they moved around the service station (for about 10 minutes) they were being recorded on CCTV. This does not show them carrying any knives which, accordingly, must have been concealed in their clothing. Neither offender has any apparent difficulty with movement and the attendant did not notice anything out of the ordinary. 

10On their way back from the service station, the offenders came across Alan Gordon, David Gordon and Christopher McDonald, who were unknown to them, walking along Maple Road, St Marys. AB and Loveridge began shouting out to them and started to follow the three youths. As they came up behind them, one or both asked for the time. Christopher McDonald told them that he did not know it. Immediately, one or other of the offenders swung a knife towards his throat. Had Christopher not instinctively recoiled, it is virtually certain that he would have suffered an extremely serious, possibly fatal injury, since he felt the blade (which he thought, probably mistakenly, was serrated) brush the lower part of his neck. 

11In his statement AB says he assaulted Christopher in this way. However, I am satisfied that, in fact, it was Loveridge. Whilst identifying which of the two struck the first blow is not itself of great significance, since I have no doubt that both had decided that, if they met a potential victim, they would attack him (or for that matter, her) and that it was for this reason that each had a knife, the fact that Loveridge struck the first blow, and did so with the obvious intention of causing an extremely serious injury, demonstrates - if it were so - that his involvement was far greater than that of a merely passive accomplice who was guilty of murder by virtue only of his encouraging presence. In respect of this issue, the important evidence comes from Christopher McDonald who said that he saw the offenders for the first time walking down a nearby street and he heard one, or possibly both, ask for the time. He turned around and said, ""Sorry boys, I haven't got the time"" when they were about 15 metres away. They were coming towards him and his brothers, he said, ""In a fast movement, like a power walk"". I interpolate that this was therefore not, so far as the offenders were concerned, an accidental meeting during a casual stroll but a premeditated attack. Christopher said that he went to continue on walking but ""one of them got in my face"". He felt ""a jagged edge"" touch his lower neck below his collar and he jumped back. (Although he thought it felt like a pair of barbeque tongs, it is clear, that this was in fact a knife.) Although Loveridge is significantly taller than AB, Christopher was unable to recall any difference in their heights. However, David Gordon was able to do so. He said that, after hearing one of the offenders call, ""What's the time"" he looked over his left shoulder and noticed one of them was running up towards him and his brothers. A step or two later the two offenders were together. He said that one of them ""went for an upper cut to hit [Christopher] in the chin... [holding] a ... metal object, could have been a ruler, could have been a spoon, could have been a blade or a screwdriver"". He did not know if the blow actually connected. The object was about 23 centimetres long. He said that the offender was ""probably a little bit taller than me"", by about six to eight centimetres. On the other hand, the other attacker who was also holding a shiny object of about the same size, was ""smaller, a bit shorter than me, probably came to my nose or eyes, just"". Furthermore, David's description of the clothes worn by each offender, distinguishing them by height, is consistent with the clothes they are shown as wearing in the CCTV taken at the service station. David Gordon, of course, gave evidence before the jury and was cross-examined. I thought he was a careful and truthful witness. As to it being the taller offender (and, hence, Loveridge) who attacked Christopher, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt his evidence is also reliable. Accordingly, Loveridge had brought a knife from the Tobruk Street premises and was the first to attack, necessarily intending, at least, to cause a very serious injury. 

12When Christopher McDonald dodged Loveridge's stroke, he yelled to the other two to run. He and David managed to get away. Tragically, however, one of the offenders knocked Alan Gordon to the ground. He was slightly built and no match for his much larger assailants, who commenced a cowardly, sadistic, pitiless, deadly attack, stabbing and cutting him repeatedly. This was briefly interrupted when a nearby resident moved his car onto the street, most likely because the offenders thought they had been seen. Perhaps 30 or 40 seconds later however, they returned and the neighbour heard one shout ""Lets finish the dog off"". The attack on the deceased, who was plainly unable to move, recommenced. Shortly after this the offenders walked back towards the Tobruk Street premises. Eyewitnesses saw what they took to be repeated kicks and punches. It was dark and the attack could not be clearly seen. Given the lack of bruising, I doubt that, if there were punches or kicks, that they were forceful. The more likely explanation for this evidence is that, as the witnesses saw no knives, although they were certainly extensively and repeatedly used, the actions they saw were the stabs. 

13The injuries to the deceased were horrific. There were 12 wounds including nine stab wounds to his back, of which six were potentially fatal; nine wounds to his right arm or hand, including two stab wounds; an incised wound to the left forearm; four stab wounds to the left upper leg near the groin area, including the scrotum; two wounds to the left upper leg posterior aspect; four wounds to the right leg including deep incised wounds severing the Achilles tendon, involving more than one stroke, being more like ""a sawing action""; and two wounds to the anterior chest wall including one through the heart which was fatal and one puncture wound possibly from medical intervention. There were four wounds to the head, including one stab wound which, although it was superficial because it was stopped by the skull, had been applied with substantial force resulting in a fracture. At the site of one incised wound a zigzag pattern was seen, such as might have come from the sole of a shoe. There were other small abrasions and scratches. The deceased suffered six wounds to the neck, of which one was a stab wound and two parallel horizontal superficial incised wounds with the appearance of having been inflicted in an attempt to cut the throat, made in quick succession while the head and neck were stationary. 

14The large number of peripheral wounds to each side of the body demonstrates, to my mind, that both of the offenders were, more or less, equally involved. One of the most troubling inferences that must be drawn from the large number of peripheral wounds is that, whilst it was their intention to kill the deceased, they wished also to torture him by the infliction of a maximum degree of pain. It is for this reason that I described the attack as sadistic. It was not a frenzied attack: the cutting of the Achilles tendon, the attempts to cut the throat and the position of the wounds, demonstrate this. It must have caused excruciating pain. 

15In the meantime, Christopher had run to the service station and asked the store attendant to contact triple 0, whilst David was attempting, unsuccessfully, to wave down passing vehicles. They returned to Maple Road and ran back to their brother. Alan was lying on the roadway, bleeding profusely and unconscious. The offenders had gone. They and a number of other witnesses attempted to render first aid. At about 3.30am police and ambulance arrived at the scene. Alan was taken to Nepean Hospital, dying en-route due to his injuries.

16The bizarre nature of the attack suggests that the offenders were affected by drugs at the time. AB's statement does not assert that he was significantly affected by drugs or was otherwise intoxicated at the time of the offences. So far as Loveridge is concerned he gave evidence that during the evening he was smoking marijuana with ice, had drunk some beer and white wine with the group at the house. He said that he had started smoking marijuana early in the morning and started drinking around three or four in the afternoon. He told police when asked about this that he was ""not stoned"" but was feeling the effects, ""just to chillax"" (meaning ""chill out and relax""). He said that another effect of the ice was to keep him awake for the night. He said that, at the time of the murder, ""We were pissed"". My view of Loveridge's credibility, having seen him in the witness box for an extensive period, is that he cannot be believed in respect of anything he says to lessen his responsibility unless it is independently supported. There is no such support for his claim to police about his intoxication. Moreover, his evidence during the trial was, in substance, that he was not significantly affected either by alcohol or drugs. I have concluded that this was the case and that neither drugs nor alcohol played a significant role in his commission of this offence. Nor did it do so in AB's case. 

17When the offenders returned to the Tobruk Street premises shortly after the attack, they changed into other clothes, which were placed in a bag with at least one of the knives. (It is not known what ultimately happened to this bag, although it is probable that it was taken by AB to his sister's home when he left Tobruk Street.) Shortly after, the offenders, together with AB's then girlfriend, left the house and walked back to the scene. It is not clear why they did this but this does not matter. When they approached the scene, they saw police cars there and returned to the premises. 

18AB and his girlfriend went to a family member's house, where AB talked about what had happened. After several moves he was ultimately arrested on 16 December 2010. Loveridge remained at Tobruk Street until the next day and was arrested at the Countrylink Travel Office at Parramatta Railway Station, in the process of booking travel to South Australia. AB, when questioned by police, admitted to his involvement in the attack and said that he had no remorse for his actions and would do it again. He declined to say how many times he stabbed the deceased or where he stabbed him or identify his accomplice. On 4 January 2011 AB told a corrections officer, when talking about the murder, that he was angry with his ex-girlfriend and thought of robbing the service station but (instead) took out his anger on the deceased and stabbed him. On 27 February 2011 he told a witness on a gaol visit that he had stabbed the deceased 13 times. During telephone calls made prison AB said on a number of occasions, in effect, he killed Alan Gordon because he was angry with his ex-girlfriend and felt the need to hurt somebody. On one of those occasions he said that he did not regret killing the deceased. In letters, which were intercepted, he accepted that he killed an ""innocent person"", commenting ""I gotta live with it for the rest of my life"", and also acknowledged that he has anger problems. 

19By contrast, Loveridge, in a number of statements to police, attempted to minimise his involvement in the crime, denying that he had or used a knife, asserting that he had only punched the deceased twice, although he admitted in effect to standing watch whilst AB attacked the deceased with his knife. As is obvious from what I have already said, these accounts were a tissue of lies. Loveridge also claimed, in effect, that he was an unwilling participant being involved only because he was frightened of AB. This also was a lie. I have no doubt that Loveridge was a willing, active and equal participant in this appalling crime.

20It was submitted by Mr Stratton on behalf of AB that I should reject the Crown's contention that the offence involved gratuitous cruelty on the basis that there was no evidence from which it can be inferred that AB inflicted any particular injury, let alone cutting the deceased's Achilles tendon, and his plea of guilty did not involve any acceptance of his knowledge of or assent to that act. Given the nature of the assaults as agreed to in the statement of facts, the mere fact, if it were so, that it was Loveridge and not AB who cut the Achilles tendon does not matter. The nature, placing and number of the wounds are convincing evidence of the character of the attack. It is unnecessary to refer to the particular aggravated feature specified in paragraph 21A(2)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Use postal/similar service to threaten to cause harm

21Between 17 December 2010 and 26 January 2011, whilst at Kariong Correctional Centre, AB wrote a letter which was lawfully intercepted by corrections officers and passed onto the police. The letter contained threats of serious violence although he also expressed regret for hurting people, ""because most of them did not deserve it... [and] if I could take it all back I would as quick as I done it."" In a later letter, of 23 March 2011 AB wrote, ""I'll do anything to take back what I done"". 

Intimidation 

22On 4 January 2011 AB telephoned his ex-girlfriend accusing her of being unfaithful and threatening to kill her. He said that even though he was in custody he could still get to her. 

Recruiting a person to commit a crime

23Following his arrest for murder, Loveridge recruited a 15 year old youth to have an informant, who had agreed to give evidence for the prosecution in his murder trial, bashed. Subsequently that informant told police he was too frightened to give evidence and, despite being subpoenaed, left the jurisdiction and was unable to be discovered. 

Intimidating witnesses

24Following his arrest for murder Loveridge wrote letters to two witnesses telling them to ""shut their mouths"". These witnesses had each given information to police which inculpated Loveridge in the murder and agreed to give evidence for the prosecution in his trial. One of these witnesses did give evidence (with obvious unease) but the other, although he entered the witness box, was plainly too frightened to give evidence against Loveridge and was stood down. 

Objective seriousness

25The circumstances, as already described, of the murder of Alan Gordon plainly enough place it in the category of most serious cases. However, the sentence must take into account also the relevant subjective features of the offenders, to which I come in due course. The break and enter offence was a very serious example of this kind of offence. The circumstance of special aggravation applying in Loveridge's case was the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm. Additional aggravating factors as specified by s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, not forming one or more of the elements or inherent characteristics of the offence, are that it was committed in company (para 21A(2)(e)) and that the victim was a vulnerable person (para 21A(2)(l)). It is obvious that any offence of breaking and entering into a house for the purpose of stealing, and intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm on an occupant is a grave crime, involving a high degree of criminal culpability. Where, in addition, the victim is old and vulnerable and represented no physical threat, so that the infliction of serious injury was merely an exercise in brutality, the objective seriousness is considerable. In this case, fortunately, Mrs Parrelli's physical injuries ultimately healed although the terror of that night will remain with her for as long as she lives. It must necessarily affect the confidence that she should be able to enjoy independently living in her own home. Loveridge is alone charged with robbing Mrs Parrelli of a wristwatch and a colour television. Given the circumstances of this offence, which include the infliction of grievous bodily harm in the home of a vulnerable victim, it is clear that the major culpability for this offence is absorbed in the breaking and entering offence. It is to avoid this doubling up that the sentence for this offence must be substantially reduced from what it would have been had it stood alone. So far as AB is concerned, he was not convicted of intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm but with committing the primary offence, in effect, whilst being an accessory to Loveridge's intentional infliction of actual bodily harm. The lesser maximum of 20 years indicates this offence is less grave than that which Loveridge faces. He must be sentenced on the basis that he did not himself inflict grievous bodily harm and did intend to do so.

26So far as the offence under s 351A(2) of the Crimes Act is concerned, recruiting a child to assist in carrying out criminal activity is itself a circumstance of aggravation and accordingly no extra punishment should be imposed for this reason. The fact that the maximum penalty is 10 years, as distinct from 7 years if the person recruited were an adult, demonstrates that it is more serious on that account. The nature of the offence, which was to procure an assault in order to punish a witness for assisting the authorities and, it is clear, to frighten the witness out of giving any evidence in the trial, is serious. This involved what would otherwise have been, for example, offences under s 315, s 315A or s 323 of the Act, which also carry a maximum term of imprisonment of 7 years. However, that does not mean that the purpose for which the offence charged was committed cannot be taken into account. 

27Loveridge also pleaded guilty to a further offence under s 323(a), as already mentioned, for influencing two persons who had given relevant information to the police and were to be called as witnesses. The threats were effective, so far as one of those witnesses was concerned. This, again, is a serious criminal offence. 

Criminal record

28AB's record commences with an offence of robbery in company committed when he was 13 years of age. About three weeks later he was convicted of common assault, destroying or damaging property, and breaking and entering. In 2007 his convictions commence in May with offences of breaking and entering, malicious damage and assault. He was convicted of affray and assaulting a law officer in December 2007, then in September 2008 he was convicted of aggravated breaking and entering and stealing, stealing a motor vehicle and possessing housebreaking instruments. In May 2010 he was convicted of cultivating a prohibited plant and having goods in personal custody suspected of being stolen, for which he was placed on probation for 12 months and, in 2011 common assault. Although these offences are not trivial, they pale into insignificance when compared to the offences for which he presently stands to be sentenced. The probation order meant that he was on conditional liberty at the time of the current offences. 

29AB's inmate profile records 11 incidents involving fights, assaults and intimidation between December 2010 and December 2012. He was given a letter of caution on 1 January 2013 for acts of violence, group assault with the use of weapon, making threats of continued violence and indicating he would kill another person in custody. A segregation report dated 10 January 2013 refers to an extensive history of violence both in the community and in custody, spanning both juvenile and adult institutions. At Kariong Correctional Centre he was identified as a major protagonist who orchestrated significant acts of violence and disobedience, leading to his transfer to adult prison.

30So far as Loveridge is concerned, he was convicted in October 2009 for possessing implements to drive a conveyance, larceny, stealing a motor vehicle and common assault. In November 2009 he was convicted of the offence of malicious damage to property. The present offences were committed whilst he was on conditional liberty, having been placed on a 6 month good behaviour bond on 2 November 2010 of common assault.

Remorse

31Loveridge was arrested on 2 December 2010 and participated in an interview with police which was recorded in the usual way. Loveridge gave lying accounts of what happened on the previous night, for which it is not necessary for present purposes to relate, except to note that he had no apparent difficulty in answering any questions. His lies about events were, although audacious, coherent and detailed. He referred to AB as ""my mate"" without naming him. The interview commenced at 8.30pm and concluded at 10.13pm. Loveridge did not at any time display any difficulties with maintaining his calm or answering questions. He was interviewed again on 22 December 2010, mainly about the break and enter. He minimised his involvement and told a number of lies. So far as the murder is concerned, the police put to him statements by various witnesses both as to the events and what AB and he told others after the offence. Loveridge said, amongst other things -

""Yeah, I come back to him, like I hit him, went off, came back and it looked still like he was on the ground, it could look like I was still assaulting him, like he was on the ground, I checked if the cunt was breathin'"". 

This was said in the context of a story, in effect, of having been there and punched the deceased once but not having stabbed him at all. He also said - 

""... when the coppers arrested me I was drunk and stoned, I wasn't like that stoned, I was comin' off it but I was still gassin' off me head, had more gas, then they interviewed me while I was still drunk and that and yeah."" 

The DVD recording shows no signs whatever of any degree of intoxication. This account cannot be accepted. 

32Loveridge's attitude to the deceased and the extent of his remorse is illustrated by such statements as ""I smacked the cunt twice and chased him up the road a little bit"" and his having ""chased the cunts"". Towards the end of the interview Loveridge said that he found out that the deceased was Aboriginal the next morning and commented, ""It made me feel real bad... its Koori, killing one of your kind, its pretty bad, you know, didn't like it, it gave me the shits."" In fairness I should mention that, at the end of the interview, when asked whether there was anything else he wanted to say, he said, ""[I] feel sorry for the kid that died, you know..."". Again, Loveridge showed no difficulty whatever with understanding any of the questions of police officers and in giving coherent, if fabricated, answers. 

33I am satisfied that Loveridge is not in any significant degree remorseful for any of the crimes for which he is to be sentenced, more particularly, either for the breaking and entering of Mrs Parrelli's home and causing her grievous bodily harm or the murder of Alan Gordon. 

34In AB's case, his plea of guilty is, perhaps, some evidence of remorse but, on the other hand, the case against him, in light especially of the various accounts he gave to a number of persons after the event, was overwhelming. In his interview with an officer of the Probation and Parole Service for the purpose of preparing a pre-sentence report he denied committing the aggravated break and enter offence although he admitted that he was present and, although he admitted the offence of murder, he disputed the police facts and gave an alternative version of the event, in which the victim was the instigator, stating that he did not care about the death of the victim, in substance claiming that it was me or him. When asked whether he felt remorseful, he stated ""remorse isn't going to bring the guy back"". The officer commented -

""[AB] did not display any signs of remorse nor did he appear to have any insight into his behaviour. He was very matter of fact when discussing the offence, i.e. what happened cannot be changed and his actions were a matter of survival and it was better that the victim was dead rather than him.

To date numerous attempts have been made to assist the offender in addressing his offending behaviour and he has displayed resistance and an unwillingness to engage with services. His unwillingness to engage with the writer concerns this Service as it appears to indicate ongoing resistance.""

35Despite the hints of regret in the correspondence and the conversations to which I have already referred, it is clear that AB does not feel remorse in respect of any of the offences for which he is to be sentenced. 

Subjective factors - Loveridge 

36Loveridge was born on 11 November 1992 and, accordingly, is almost 21 years of age. The offences were committed just after his 18th birthday. Tendered in the sentence proceedings was a selection from a very large amount of material from the Department of Community Services about him. His father was 17 years of age and his mother 15 years of age when he was born. They had six children of which Loveridge was the eldest. The first report is dated 29 February 2000, indicating, amongst other things that the parents often did not live together, and that the children were seriously neglected, living in a house which was ""disgusting"" and the mother used drugs as well as abused prescription drugs. The children were left at home by themselves at night and had no regular time for meals and Loveridge, then six years old, shopped for the family. A report shortly after describes Loveridge's behaviour as violent and threatening but, on the other hand, he was attempting to take care of his siblings. During that month there were a further five reports vividly describing the gross neglect of the children. The children were then placed in temporary care of maternal family members and, two months later, with foster carers, Loveridge going to the home of his maternal uncle. At seven years old in June 2000 he is noted as depressed and suicidal with associated problematical behaviour. One way or another these problems continued through ensuing years with the contact visit reports indicating serious problems of one kind or another. He struggled with school and, although he did not have a learning disability, his test results were borderline normal. He was associating with ""friends stealing, fighting and doing drugs"". In April 2009 he was admitted to Mount Druitt hospital because of an overdose and was diagnosed with mood disorder, but no mental illness, rather ""anger management"" problems. He told the doctor that he was ""in gangs, threatening to kill someone and is not afraid of dying"". The hospital notes record the following formulation -

""16 year old male, [history] of impulsive overdoses and poly-substance abuse, [history] of poor impulse control and anti-social personality traits. Presents with suicidal thoughts with no specific plan - unable to guarantee his safety. [He] has been living on the streets, with some friends - sometimes at ""Nan's house"" in Wentworthville"" 

The file notes that on a previous admission he assaulted staff. These characteristics were noted in May 2009 at Penrith Youth Refuge. In November 2009 it was reported - 

""Corrie is without an authorised placement having been evicted from the Nepean Youth Refuge on 12 November 2009. Corrie has a history of high risk drug and alcohol abuse and living in unauthorised and inappropriate placements. He has a history of and remains a high risk of engaging in and/or being the victim of anti-social and petty criminal activities. Corrie is at high risk of inappropriate relationships and organised crime, including bikie gangs. Corrie's IQ has been assessed as below average with a low capacity of a situation or judgment and impulse control.""

The report then lists a number of matters, including being in breach of bail and bond conditions. Reference is also made to low range intellectual functioning. All in all the report gives a bleak picture with nothing that can be considered at all positive. He was then 17 years of age. Ongoing material in 2010 showed no improvement. The last report before the offences noted - 

""Corrie basically said he's not interested in anything, has no motivation or feelings towards life and will stay [at Tobruk Street] until he gets a place through DOH... Corrie said that he doesn't care if he ends up in ""big boys jail"" and in fact he seemed to pretty much expect that this is inevitable regardless of our discussions about choice, support and people who love him, future plans etc..."" 

37A statement was tendered from Mrs Mara, who gave a history of the family and Loveridge in particular which reflects the matters to which I have already referred. He was placed with Mr and Mrs Mara as long term foster carers in 2000. His two youngest siblings went with him because he had been, in effect, their principal carer. Schooling was always problematical for him and he left high school in year 10. Mrs Mara recounts unsuccessful attempts made by Loveridge to reconnect with his parents. When he was just under 16 ½ years of age he moved in with his girlfriend and her mother but this also proved to be unfortunate, with Loveridge becoming violent towards his girlfriend. Mrs Mara describes Loveridge as seeming ""to be spiralling out of control"", overdosing on drugs, requiring admission to hospital. He threatened self-harm in attempts to be hospitalised. In August 2010 his only close friend was shot and killed. This had a bad effect on Loveridge who began living transiently wherever he could, eventually going to live in the house at Tobruk Street. 

38Also tendered on the sentence proceedings were reports from Dr Richard Furst a consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Furst had available to him the DOCS material to which I have already referred, Corrective Services records and Justice Health medical records. He also took a history from Loveridge, amongst other things as to his family background and mental state from time to time, including reports of hallucinations and psychotic symptoms in the form of ""voices telling him to kill himself, paranoid thinking, mood instability and self-harming behaviour."" When interviewed on 28 August 2013 Dr Furst noted -

""Mr Loveridge... [had] a simple manner, and [was] anxious, but was logical throughout the assessment period and had no objective signs of psychosis. 

He was not suicidal or threatening in his manner. Mr Loveridge had an upcoming sentencing hearing.

His cognition was not formally examined, however there were no obvious indications of cognitive disorder. He probably has only borderline intellectual functioning based on his use of language throughout the interview. He was aware that he would need further counselling for his emotional problems and substance abuse issues.""

The doctor's review of the documentary material produced the following summary - 

""He had an early onset of mood instability, emotional problems, severe behavioural disturbance, drug use, gang affiliations, anti-social attitudes, anger, impulsivity and conduct disorder including past criminal offending. Those features are indicative of an antisocial personality disorder as his primary mental health diagnosis.""

Dr Furst considered also that, given his reported drug use, Loveridge meets the criteria for a substance use disorder. In summary, Dr Furst considered - 

""In my view, Mr Loveridge probably does suffer from a psychotic illness, meeting criteria for the diagnosis for a drug induced psychosis and possibly an emerging schizophrenic illness. At this stage, his mental state features were not indicative of a major mental illness, as he was logical in his thinking and has preservation of his range of effective expression. I thought that his reported auditory hallucinations and paranoid thinking were most likely the manifestations of drug induced psychosis, precipitated by his recent drug use."" 

He noted, however, that in ""nearly every case, the symptoms of methamphetamine-induced psychosis will stop within 7-10 days of discontinuing the drug"" although a small percentage of heavy users continue to experience intermittent psychotic episodes within the first year of abstinence. 

39Dr Furst noted that psychometric testing revealed that Loveridge has ""low intelligence (borderline range) but does not meet criteria for an intellectual disability"". 

40Dr Furst referred to Loveridge's account of the extent of his abuse of alcohol and other drugs shortly before the offences. Although he thought that Loveridge ""may well have experienced intermittent feelings of paranoia and auditory hallucinations at the time of the offending conduct in question as a product of his intoxication"" he noted that no symptoms of paranoia or auditory hallucinations were reported to police at the time of his two interviews, although he said he was intoxicated. Dr Furst added - 

""[Loveridge's] Justice Health file in the days and weeks following arrest indicated previous anger problems but no history of serious mental illness, possible auditory hallucinations and previous paranoid thoughts were noted in relation to drug use, but were reported as historical and were not present at the time of the mental health assessment in December 2010. Subsequent entries in 2011, 2012, and 2013 raise the possibility of Mr Loveridge developing a more serious mental illness in custody with stronger evidence for drug induced psychosis and the possibility of emerging schizophrenic illness."" 

41These conclusions must be read in light Dr Furst's earlier report of 19 February 2013 which followed an assessment of Loveridge on 6 February 2013 when Dr Furst had available to him, inter alia, the Justice Health medical records but not the DOCS material. Dr Furst noted that a number of Loveridge's statements, including those as to his understanding about his legal predicament, were not convincing. Dr Furst thought also that the Justice Health reports showed that Loveridge had exaggerated somewhat in his account of his experiences whilst in custody. Dr Furst noted in this respect that he thought Loveridge ""may well be exaggerating his symptoms, especially given the lack of objective signs of distress or other affective features and the nursing observations at Parklea revealing that he was reasonably stable."" 

42I have mentioned my view of Loveridge's credibility. It is also worth noting that the most consistent feature of his evidence as well as his interviews with police was his ability to fabricate quite detailed accounts of his conduct over the relevant periods, all of which tended to reduce his culpability for any wrongdoing. I informed Mr Austin of counsel for Loveridge of my view about his client's veracity and that I would not accept the truthfulness of any history he gave to Dr Furst unless his client gave evidence of those matters. He did not do so. However, without accepting as completely reliable his accounts of his mental condition made to DOCS officers, which strike me as somewhat manipulative, I accept the reliability of the DOCS material in relation to Loveridge's family situation, upbringing, schooling, drug abuse and the other contextual matters which I have mentioned above. 

43Taking all this material together, it is, I think, appropriate to deal with Loveridge on the basis that, as a result of circumstances beyond his control, his insight into the true moral character of his actions and his ability to exercise judgment about them was significantly less than that of a young person of his age who had grown up in a healthy and supportive familial situation. To these problems must be added the immaturity which is the natural concomitant of his age. Though on one level he was well capable of glib, indeed cunning denials and creative lies, yet they were exposed with relative ease. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that Loveridge well, if incompletely, appreciated the moral and criminal culpability of his actions although I rather think that his callousness was significantly contributed to, if not entirely caused by, the warped moral world that shaped his upbringing. 

Subjective factors - AB

44The material in this respect tendered in the sentence proceedings was a Juvenile Justice background report of 9 September 2013, a Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report dated 22 February 2013 and a collection of extracts from AB's DOCS file. AB, who is now 20 years and 6 months old, is one of two siblings born to his parents, who separated when he was an infant. When he was 18 months of age he was removed from his mother's care and placed in foster care. His mother was 12 years of age when AB's older sister was born and 15 when she gave birth to him. AB was removed from his mother's care in November 1994 due to reports of neglect, physical abuse, exposure to parental heroin abuse and domestic violence. He had about 12 different placements whilst in foster care with extended family members and foster carers, his most consistent placement during his childhood being with his maternal grandmother, whose standard of care was, to say the least, uneven.

45When in other placements he left of his own accord and returned to reside with his grandmother. It was whilst living with her that, at the age of 12, he found her comatose, having suffered a stroke which proved fatal. For a period he lived with an uncle whose attempts to place appropriate boundaries was unsuccessful. In August 2008 his uncle returned to Queensland for medical reasons and AB lived for a short time with his mother, then moving into the home of a girlfriend in January 2009, residing there with her parents and two younger siblings. He moved between various homes of friends and relatives, relocating many times. He had only limited contact with his mother, who has spent time in custody, and no contact with his father for about nine years. AB informed the Probation and Parole officer that his mother, father, older sister and younger half-brother all have criminal histories, as do other extended family members and most of his friends. As at February 2013 his mother was under supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, having been released from custody on 4 December 2012. AB has had a number of intimate personal relationships over the years and has two children and perhaps three more with whom he has no contact, all with unhappy outcomes. He was in a relationship with Ms Salas-Collard at the time of his arrest but since then the relationship has ended. Service records indicated that his most frequent visitor whilst he has been in custody was his mother but, since September 2009, he has had no visitors although his mother has expressed a desire to visit him. AB claims to identify strongly with his Aboriginal heritage though it is clear that his understanding of what it entails is very limited. 

46As to education, AB attended several different schools depending where he was living and, towards the end of his primary education he was referred to two separate special schools catering for students with challenging behaviours. His attendance was low with multiple periods of truancy, conflict with other students and limited interest in being at school. In July 2006 he was enrolled in a high school to attend a specialist class. However, he continued to truant frequently regardless of additional supports put in place, including teacher aides and assistance from Aboriginal liaison officers at the school. He left the school in 2007 without completing year eight. He spent approximately nine months of 2008 in custody. Upon his release he was referred to several alternative educational and employment support programs, with initial motivation and interest but without following through or effective participation. His limited schooling has resulted in his literacy and numeracy skills being below that of his general age group. I should mention, however, in narrating this bleak account, that he entered and successfully completed one vocational program in August 2009, which ran for eight weeks, designed to expose participants to the opportunities, structure and requirements of TAFE. AB showed an interest in pursuing a trade but, when a course became available he declined to undertake it. AB reported to Juvenile Justice that he had several short periods of employment. There are no mental health diagnoses; when community services attempted any health care follow up, he declined to participate and absconded from his placements to avoid appointments. In late 2008 during a period in a Juvenile Justice Centre he was prescribed an anxiety (and behaviour modification) medication but, upon release he ceased medication and declined to follow up, it appears because he felt no benefit from the medication. When he was arrested for the present offences he was prescribed Avanza but, when he was transferred to the MRRC at Silverwater, he ceased this medication.

47AB has reported (and I accept) a history of substance abuse from an early age, including alcohol, cannabis and amphetamines. He participated in various alcohol and drug programs but, except for one conducted in October 2007, has not completed any. AB informed the Juvenile Justice Officer that he believed that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time of the breaking and entering and murder offences. 

48The following summary is taken from the Probation and Parole pre-sentence report (not materially different from the position taken in the Juvenile Justice background report) - 

""[AB] has been significantly influenced by negative anti-social behaviour throughout his life and his lifestyle has been characterized by socializing with both negative peers and family members who have engaged in regular use of illicit drugs and alcohol, engaged in violence and offending. He appears to consider this to be a normal part of life and to date has not experienced a life separated from those influences. 

[AB] is a young man who has developed the belief that violence is a normal part of life and it has been necessary for him to engage in violence to survive. He expressed to this Service that he believes he has always been violent and does not believe he will change, reporting that is just the way he is and he needs to remain violent in custody to survive.

[AB] did not display any signs of remorse nor did he appear to have any insight into his behaviour. He was very matter of fact when discussing the offence, i.e. what happened cannot be changed and his actions were a matter of survival and it was better that the victim was dead rather than him. 

To date numerous attempts have been made to assist the offender in addressing his offending behaviour and he has displayed resistance and an unwillingness to engage with services. His unwillingness to engage with the writer concerns this Service as it appears to indicate ongoing resistance.""

49The extracts from the DOCS file confirm AB's exposure to abusive behaviour, including significant violence, at the instance of his mother, even whilst he was living with his grandmother and despite his grandmother's attempts to protect him and his sister. Also demonstrated are his schooling problems, his consistent violent behaviour towards caregivers and peers. The documentary material ends with a report of September 2007 by the Juvenile Justice Officer following offences committed in December 2006 and subsequent breaches of bail. 

50There is no reason to suppose that, aside from his obvious problems with aggression, AB suffers from any mental illness or personality disorder. As with Loveridge, however, AB's upbringing was not such as to instil respect or understanding for moral standards, let alone the law. As with Loveridge, this may explain, in part, his indifference to the crimes for which he is now to be sentenced and which he persists in lying about. I would add also the immaturity of his youth.

Prospects for rehabilitation 

51Rehabilitation is an important consideration when dealing with young offenders. Although, given the character of the offences and the lack of remorse, it is difficult to see any real likelihood of rehabilitation, each of the offenders is young with a great deal of growing up to do. In R v Crump (unreported NSWCCA 30 May 1994), Allen J said -

""It is the common experience of judges who have had to consider s13A applications to note the remarkable affect which imprisonment for a decade or more so often has upon young offenders - notwithstanding how brutally and callously they acted when they committed the crime or crimes. Time and again one wonders: ""How could this apparently well-adjusted applicant be the person who committed such a crime?"" Gone is the brashness. Gone is the bravado. Spent is the passion. Young offenders can change so much during a very long time in gaol as to present almost as an entirely different sort of person.""

52An additional factor is that the offenders will (though many years hence) have available to them intensive educational and other therapeutic programs designed to encourage rehabilitation. Indeed, if these programs are not successfully undertaken, not only may release on parole be refused, but they may be subjected to further incarceration even after their sentences have been served. However, this may be, the most significant feature of the potential for rehabilitation is likely to be getting older. Accordingly, despite the matters that would suggest the contrary, I approach the sentencing of the offenders on the basis that there is some potential for rehabilitation and that this is an important consideration. 

Significance of the pleas of guilty

53I have already mentioned that AB's pleas of guilty do not to my mind exhibit any remorse. Given the overwhelming strength of the Crown case, they merely acknowledged the inevitable. In almost every case, an early plea will, for utilitarian reasons of public policy make it appropriate to reduce the sentence which would otherwise be imposed by about 25 per cent and, in some rare cases, perhaps more. However, the protection of the public may require this discount to be withheld. In my view, this is such a case in respect of the crime of murder. In respect of the other offences, I have applied a utilitarian discount of 25 per cent.

54In Loveridge's case, he pleaded guilty to the additional offences on the first day of the trial. Given the nature of the evidence that must have been called if these trials had proceeded and the fact that, almost certainly, those trials would have been separated from that for murder, it seems to me a discount of 15 per cent is appropriate in respect of each of those offences. 

Aboriginality 

55I accept that both offenders identified as Aboriginal and were part of an Aboriginal community through one or other of their parents or relatives. However, they were undoubtedly urbanised and had not grown up or been touched by an Aboriginal community. Both came from seriously deprived backgrounds characterised not only by the abuse of alcohol but also other illicit drugs and violence fuelled, no doubt, by these substances. I have accepted that these circumstances played a role in their commission of the offences and must be given full weight. However, as the plurality said in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 87 ALJR 1022 - 

""[44] ... An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.""

Here, of course, the offenders' violence was in no sense a response to frustration, but was planned and instigated by them.

Protection of the public

56The only reasonable inference from the nature of the attack is that each offender obtained some unimaginable satisfaction or pleasure from the pain they deliberately inflicted on a young man who had done nothing whatever to provoke them. This makes them very dangerous individuals, so that the protection of the public is of particular point in the consideration of their sentences. However, that consideration cannot justify a sentence that is greater than the criminal culpability of the offences would justify: preventive detention is no part of the sentencing function. The evidence does not permit the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the offenders will always constitute a danger to the community, yet the crime itself demonstrates to my mind that there is a real likelihood that there will be a continuing substantial risk of violent re-offending. 

Conclusion 

57The maximum term of imprisonment for the crime of murder is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. It obviously must be reserved to the worst class of case after both the objective and subjective factors are taken into account. Since AB was under 18 years of age at the date of the murder, s 61(6) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act precludes the imposition of a life sentence on him. In Loveridge's case (who was only just over 18 years of age at the time), his age, immaturity, intellectual and psychological characteristics, render a life sentence without parole as inappropriate although the circumstances of the crime would have done so. 

58I have mentioned that, so far as Loveridge is concerned, the standard non-parole period of 25 years is to be taken into account in respect of the offence of murder, together with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, in assessing the appropriate sentence. The offence of robbery and causing grievous bodily harm carries a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

59Loveridge's youth, the potential for rehabilitation and the length of the head sentence which I intend to impose together amount to special circumstances justifying a variation of the ratio prescribed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

60So far as AB is concerned the standard non-parole periods do not, as I have said, apply to him. However, the same considerations as to the objective circumstances of the offence apply to him as to Loveridge. As with Loveridge I would accept that his deprived upbringing and relative youth mitigate to some degree the seriousness of his offences. The same considerations as with Loveridge apply to the issue of special circumstances.

61In respect of the murder of Alan Gordon, when all is said and done, it is the extreme criminality of what the offenders did and why they did it that marks the grave seriousness of the crime and demands concomitant sentences.

Sentences

62I propose to pass on each offender an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. AB's sentence will commence on 16 December 2010, Loveridge's on 2 December 2010. For reasons of simplicity, the adjustment for special circumstances (calculated in terms of years rather than as a percentage of the overall sentence) has been made only in respect of the offence of murder. In AB's case, I consider that the crime of murder is so serious and warrants such a severe sentence that it is not appropriate to apply a discount for his plea. The indicative sentences are as follows - 

63Corrie Loveridge:

(1)For the offence of breaking and entering in circumstances of special aggravation, namely the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm on Elena Parrelli, an overall sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months.

(2)For the offence of robbery in company and the infliction of grievous bodily harm, an overall sentence of 1 year 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months.

(3)For recruiting a child to commit a crime, a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment.

(4)For influencing witnesses, a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment.

(5)For the murder of Alan Gordon, a non-parole period of 30 years with a balance of term of 15 years.

The aggregate sentence is a non-parole period of 30 years with a balance of term of 15 years.

64AB:

(1)For the offence of breaking and entering in circumstances of aggravation, namely the intentional or reckless infliction of actual bodily harm on Elena Parrelli, an overall sentence of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months.

(2)For the offence of intimidation, taking into account the offence on the Form 1, a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment.

(3)For the murder of Alan Gordon, a non-parole period of 30 years with a balance of term of 15 years.

The aggregate sentence is a non-parole period of 30 years with a balance of term of 15 years.

65The earliest date upon which Loveridge can be released on parole is 2 December 2040. The earliest date upon which AB can be released on parole is 16 December 2040.

		15 November 2013",2013-10-31 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762668,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Trudgett [2013] NSWSC 1607,"Judgment

1This is an appeal under s 56 (1)(c) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 against an order made by a Magistrate dismissing a summary charge brought against the defendant, Tamika Jade Trudgett. The right to appeal exists only on a ground that involves a question of law alone. 

2The defendant was charged with breaking and entering a residence and stealing property contrary to s 112 Crimes Act 1900. Briefly, the prosecution case was that the defendant and her friend Sara Mitchell decided to steal goods from a dwelling house in Dubbo. They knew the house, having previously lived there. They had in mind a particular room in the house, occupied by a resident whose property they considered worth stealing. They intended to try to sell whatever they could steal to raise money to buy drugs. 

3Unfortunately the Magistrate's findings of fact were incomplete and imprecise. The evidence was capable of proving that these things happened. The defendant was driving her car. She took Mitchell and herself to the vicinity of the house. They arranged that Mitchell should enter and steal whatever she could and that the defendant should remain nearby in the car, ready to take them both away when the time came. Mitchell entered the house through a window and went to the door of the room they had in mind. It was locked, so Mitchell left the house and telephoned the defendant, who told her to wrap something around her fist and break a window to get into the room. The room had its own bathroom. Mitchell broke the bathroom window, entered the bathroom and gained access to the room where the desired property was. She stole property and called the defendant by telephone. The defendant responded and drove the two away from the scene.

4Mitchell pleaded guilty before another Magistrate to one charge of breaking, entering and stealing. Her legal representative told the court that she would give evidence against the defendant. She was convicted and made subject to a bond. 

5Mitchell gave evidence against the defendant and there were these questions and answers:

Q. Now I'm going to ask you to remember back to 12 October 2011. On that day you were with Tamika Trudgett?
A. Yes

Q. And something happened that day?

Q. And what did you do then?
A. I got out of the car and went to the house.


...


Q. So she said ""When you finish""--
A. Yes. 

Q. --okay what - did you know what she meant by that?
A. Yes. 

Q. And what did you think she meant by that?
A. Well it was spoken - we both spoke about it as we drove up there about breaking into the house and getting anything that we could to get some money--

Q. Okay? 
A. -and so yeah.

Q. So when you say you spoke about it, do you remember what was said? 
A. Not exactly.

A. Yes.

Q. -- was that in reference to the conversation you'd had on the way up? 
A. Yes.

...

Q. Now when you've said that the car was stopped I think you said four or five houses away--
A. Yes.

Q. -- why was that? 
A. Actually I don't know why she stopped four or five houses away but it was I don't know maybe so people wouldn't see the car.

Q. And she said ""When you're finished give her a ring""? 
A. Yes.

Q. And you got out of the car, is that right? 
A. Yes.

Q. And what did you do then? 
A. I went to the house. 

Q. And what happened then? 
A. I climbed in one of the bedroom windows and went to the room where the girl that was staying in the door was locked so I went back out of the house and rang Tamika because I didn't know what to do--

Q. Yes?
A. -- she told me to wrap a towel around or something around my hand and smash a window open so I could get in--

Q. Yes?
A. -- so I did that and then went into the house I grabbed whatever I could see then when I was finished I called Tamika and she come and picked me up from the front door.


Q. So when you say ""Tamika said to wrap a"" did you say a towel? A. Wrap my hand--

Q. Wrap your hand
A. Around the towel or shirt something so that I wouldn't get yeah wouldn't get glass in it or anything like that.

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember what you took?
A. There was two laptops, a camera and some clothes. 

Q. And you then said that you rang Tamika again? 
A. Yes.

Q. Where were you when you rang Tamika? 
A. At the front door inside the house.

Q. At the front door inside the house? 
A. Yes.

Q. And do you remember what that conversation was? 
A. All I said to her was that she had to come and pick me up that I'd finished getting what I needed to get--

Q. Yes?
A. --and then she yeah basically - she appeared within three, maybe four minutes.


6Mitchell went on to say that they had sold the computers for about $700 and had used the money to buy fuel for the defendant's car, cigarettes and speed.

7The defendant was interviewed by the police and a typed transcript came into evidence. There were these questions and answers:

Q3 O.K. Tamika, as you're aware I'm making inquiries in relation

8The statement of the occupant of the room was tendered. It contained these paragraphs:

I have been residing at [xxxx] Dubbo for about one and a half years. I rent a room from [name].

About 9.45am on Wednesday 12th October 2011 I left for work. I rent the front bedroom which has an ensuite. I have a lock on my bedroom.

About 5.45pm on the same day I returned home from work. I opened the front door and unlocked my bedroom door, when I noticed my Dell XPS laptop was gone. I left my laptop on my bed before I left for work. I looked for my other laptop which was a Dell XPS and I realised it was also gone. I knew then someone had broken into my room. The newer XPS its like a red/pink in colour.

I opened my bathroom door and I saw the glass window above the toilet had been smashed and entry had been gained. There were blood droplets on the toilet seat and tiles. I contacted [name] the owner of the house and advised him my room had been broken into. After I called [name] I looked around and realised my SLR camera (Canon ESOS 450P) had been stolen and had an extra lens which was still in the box. It is a Canon EF Zoom lens (22.55mm). The camera is worth $2000 the laptops I bought one for $2000 and the other was around $2200.

9Mitchell was cross-examined. She agreed that her solicitor had told the Magistrate who heard her case that she would give evidence against the defendant. She supposed that that might have gone in her favour. She agreed that she and the defendant were no longer on good terms. Surprisingly, in view of what the defendant had told the police in her interview (cf. QA 51-55, 67) it was put to Mitchell that the defendant did not know that Mitchell was going to the house to steal and that Mitchell had told the defendant that she, Mitchell, was going there to collect property she had left there. Unsurprisingly, Mitchell denied those suggestions. She repeated that although she could not remember in detail the words used, there was a plan to steal from the house. It was put to her that she had not spoken to the defendant before breaking the window. She reiterated that she had.

10The hearing began on 21 June 2012. The solicitor for the defendant objected to the tender of several pieces of evidence, including a transcript of the defendant's interview with Detective Sergeant Scott and a statement of Mitchell. The objections took a long time to deal with. On 23 October 2012 his Honour decided to admit the transcript but to reject Mitchell's statement. Accordingly her only evidence was that which she gave orally. The hearing began but was adjourned part heard to 31 January 2013. At the conclusion of evidence Counsel began to address and there were these exchanges between the police prosecutor, Mr Lawrence, for the defendant, and his Honour: 

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour the prosecution case is case of joint criminal enterprise ultimately your Honour. Your Honour is well aware of Tangye authorities in relation to joint criminal enterprise.

In my submission your Honour the evidence is clear that there was certainly an agreement between the parties to commit the break and enter, to obtain items for profit in order to buy things for themselves.

Your Honour has before you the evidence contained within the interviews. Your Honour I note in the interview with the accused she is asked clearly that whether she was aware at the time or prior to Miss Mitchell entering the house - I don't have the page number I do apologise your Honour - she is asked whether she was aware that Miss Mitchell was going to break into the house and she replies ""Yes"".

...

In addition to that your Honour the evidence of Miss Mitchell is quite clear that it was something that had been planned on the way, if not before then certainly on the way to the property and she's given evidence of the accused's involvement.

Your Honour of course the commission of any element by one person under a joint criminal enterprise is committed by both persons. That is a paraphrasing of course but that is the relevant principle. On that basis the evidence before you is that Miss Trudgett participated in conveying Miss Mitchell, picking
Miss Mitchell up, assisted her in the method of entry, assisted her in disposing of the property afterwards and was certainly involved at all levels and at all times.

Your Honour the evidence of Miss Mitchell is of course crucial to the prosecution case. Your Honour had an opportunity to view Miss Mitchell giving that evidence first hand in the box. That evidence your Honour, I would submit, is evidence that you would accept. It was given in a clear calm concise manner. It was given in a thoughtful manner. There was no attempt to hide her own involvement. There was no attempt to hide her use of drugs at the time and previously. She responded clearly without hesitation to matters which perhaps may have placed her in a bad light if I can put it that way. She was, in my submission, a witness of truth and your Honour would accept her evidence.

Given her evidence, given the admissions contained in the records of interview your Honour in my submission the prosecution has proved and proved beyond a reasonable doubt the case before you.

...

LAWRENCE: Thank you your Honour. Your Honour first it's my submission that my friends put it a little bit high when he suggests that the answers on p 5, 55 and 56 demonstrate knowledge of a plan to break, enter and steal. I think that was the phrase that he used. Though your Honour the answers are actually,

""Q55. So did you know she was going in there to steal stuff?
A. Yeah.

Q56. Okay and how did you think she was going to get into the house?
A. I have no idea and usually when we used to live there they used to leave it unlocked all the time.""

So your Honour not in my submission direct evidence of knowledge of the intention to break certainly.

...

HIS HONOUR: What do you say the situation is if - the situation was is that I remember I limited the first interview which is the one that occurred with Sara Mitchell, on the basis that it was what informed the police decision to then arrest and there are all sorts of issues that were raised about that decision and those have all been decided. As it turns out its fallen against your client.

But the question now is, is it on the basis of joint criminal enterprise if I were not to believe Sara Mitchell about the agreement to break into the house. The evidence of admissions in this record of interview only goes to an enter enclosed lands and a stealing, but not to the eminent breaking. 

LAWRENCE: That's the submission your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So if I was to be uncertain on the standard of criminal responsibility in relation to an agreement to break because I, for example, only have the evidence of someone who I must give myself directions about because they're criminal involved, then would you say that I would find your client not guilty?

LAWRENCE: Yes your Honour. And that your Honour flows, in my submission, from the fact that the prosecutor has put his case as that of principal in the first degree.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

LAWRENCE: Not your Honour on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise or common purpose. And your Honour the submission about Miss Mitchell is that you wouldn't accept her beyond a reasonable doubt. Your Honour in addition to the things that you've averted to which I won't repeat I'd also ask you to take into account the fact that she was somewhat evasive in my submission on the question of assistance. Initially your Honour seeming to indicate that she wasn't aware that these matters will go in her favour but then eventually agreeing that she told her lawyer those things and he told the court those things because they would stand in her favour. Your Honour she has admitted that it was my client who ended the friendship and that was-

HIS HONOUR: Look you can take it that I have doubts about the agreement to break so the question then becomes a legal one as to the extent of the joint criminal enterprise so I'll need to hear from the prosecutor about that. I mean it's - yes so Mr Prosecutor it's a situation assuming that there are difficulties because of the directions I must give myself in relation to the evidence about the agreement to break which you've just heard me address Mr Lawrence about. What do you say about whether I can be satisfied of that element in relation to the offence charged in terms of a joint criminal enterprise?

11His Honour read out the terms of the direction deriving from R v Lowery (No 2) [1972] VR 560 and cited with approval by Hunt CJ at CL with whom McInerney and Sully JJ agreed, in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 557, commonly given to juries where the Crown relies on the principles of joint criminal enterprise. Then the debate continued:

So there's a distinction between that example given that I've just read out and this example because that example involves everybody having formed a view because of the appearance of the house because of the newspapers out the front. The only direct evidence I've got is from Sara Mitchell but otherwise the admission of Miss Trudgett is to going to the house maybe to steal items but not with the element of breaking in that admission.

PROSECUTOR: Well with respect your Honour my reading is not quite so clear in that regard.

HIS HONOUR: Okay well what do you say.

PROSECUTOR: That admission, looking at the questions and answers as a whole, at 54,

""Q54. So when you say you knew she was going in to get something was the stuff she was going in to get hers or-
A. No.

Q55. No. So did you know she was going in there to steal stuff?
A. Yeah.""

HIS HONOUR: Yes well that's - there's no difficulty about entering and stealing. The question is as to break.

PROSECUTOR: Correct. The question is then, ""How did you think she was going to get into the house?"" and the answer is, ""I have no idea and usually when we used to live there they used to leave it unlocked all the time.""

An unlocked house is not necessarily, even if it had been unlocked, is not necessarily a house which is wide open. Unlocked-

HIS HONOUR: I've got to say I've got to look this up again. In terms of breaking-

PROSECUTOR: An unlocked door which needs to be opened is still a break and enter, or still a break.

LAWRENCE: I concede that your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Right well. The opening of an interior closed door is sufficient. And breaking to unlatch the window if the window is opened sufficient. A constructive breaking occurs when entry is obtained by fraud or threats or by the use of a key which the person is not entitled to use. I don't think it goes so far as to say breaking involves opening a door, an external door which was unlocked does it. Well it's an important distinction as turns out. Break means forcibly gained access. It is not breaking to walk through an open door. There's no definition of breaking in the Crimes Act. It's not breaking to open an already open window. Raising of a door, flat door. Opening a window which is shut but unlocked or lifting a latch or loosening any other fastening is being found to be a break. I don't think opening an unlocked door is a break. External door.

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour as to, I have as to breaks, breaking may be actual or constructive. Actual breaking is where the security of the house is infringed though there need not be any actual breaking of any object. It's not breaking to further open a door which is partly open but the opening of an interior closed door is sufficient.

HIS HONOUR: One would have thought that if the law was at the position that opening an external unlocked door was a breaking then it might have been made clear. Surely that's not asking for too much. The raising of a flap door, 1833 case, The Queen v Russell. What is a flap door, is that door in the floor I presume. Opening a window which is shut but unlocked. All right.

All right there's a case of R v Lackey - sorry R v Brown, to open a shut but not locked door or window and is a breaking. Authorities for those propositions are discussed by Simpson J in the Court of Criminal Appeal case of Stanford v R (2007) NSWCCA 370. 
Well in that case the legislature was invited to consider reforming s 112 of the Crimes Act (NSW) which is what we're dealing with here. Simpson J said for example,

""Well it hardly accords with the modern approach to criminal law to regard a breaking as identified in the authorities as criminal while taking advantage of a partly ajar door or window does not constitute a breaking. Any entry to a domestic or business premises for the purpose of committing criminal offences ought to be subject to the same criminal sanctions. Perhaps it is time s 112 attracted the attention of law reformers.""

This in the context of having discussed the fact that Smith is still good law which is a case which requires there to have been - well it suggests that to open, further open an already opened window not so secured is not breaking. All right.

Well yes sorry Mr Prosecutor I think that the legal position as I see it is the law hasn't changed since this case.

...

I'm happy to - I'll give you some time if you need it, the matter's gone on for a long time now, I'd like to finish it today but it appears that we're going to have some time today. I'm happy to stand the matter down for an hour for this to be considered. I think it's an important point, but I have to say on the face of it from what I've seen I have difficulties seeing how you can overcome of it.

PROSECUTOR: This is the issue of break your Honour?

HIS HONOUR: The issue of break. I mean it requires me to have formed a reasonable doubt about the evidence of Sara Mitchell, which I can tell you now I have, that is that because she's a person - because of the directions that I must give myself about her being a person who is criminally involved in the proceedings and because there's no other evidence of an agreement about that element then I will - I have a doubt about it at this time.

That is that Miss Trudgett may have had the view that they could go to the house because the house was always left open and therefore Sara Mitchell could enter the house easily because it was always left unlocked but with the doors closed. So the question then becomes if that's true - if that's the factual position I'm in on the standard - criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, this not being a civil case of course which would be different, then would that constitute a break and enter to have an agreement to go to a house which might be left unlocked. And the state of the law it doesn't look like it can be, but I'm happy to be corrected if I'm wrong.

PROSECUTOR: Thank you for that time your Honour. As I understand it your Honour there was two propositions your Honour was considering.

If I might turn firstly, the proposition your Honour raised in relation to whether a closed but unlocked door constituted a break. I don't have a case your Honour. What I can hand up is a printoff from Thomson Reuters from the commentaries. I've shown my friend. I have a copy for him if he requires.

If I could draw your Honour's attention, the second paragraph, there is a breaking of a door or window which, without being fastened, was completely closed. That comes from a 1799 case of R v Brown, as your Honour can see it's subsequently affirmed in a number of decisions.

Most recently in Galea v R which is a 1989 English case as I understand which I was not able to print off a copy of.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

PROSECUTOR: That your Honour I rely on in my support for the submission that even if the house was unlocked, if in fact a door had to be opened in order to gain entry, then that constitutes a break.

HIS HONOUR: Commonsense would suggest that's right but I don't think that's what the law is unfortunately. Yes, but I hear you, I hear your submission. Yes all right.

PROSECUTOR: I can't take it any higher than those cases your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: No well none of us are assisted by nothing being directly on point really are we. All right.

PROSECUTOR: I could only - in addition to that sorry your Honour the case Hyams where to raise a closed but unfastened window I would submit is sufficiently similar to, in my submission, to support it, and I think a matter or case your Honour has already referred to, to raise a cellar flap that is kept down only by its own weight, it's a case of Russell which was an 1833 case which in my submission also supports the proposition.

HIS HONOUR: Yes all right. Thank you for that. Well that's really the major issue that I've got in relation to the matters, if you follow the chain of logic that I've expressed through in relation to the witness Sara Mitchell. That being the main evidence in relation to what is alleged as a common, joint criminal enterprise.

PROSECUTOR: Is your Honour satisfied in relation to, if that issue of the break is overcome is your Honour satisfied as to joint criminal enterprise or do you wish to be heard further.

LAWRENCE: Look I had some further submissions on that point your Honour also, just before any firm view is expressed.

HIS HONOUR: About the break?

LAWRENCE: No on the issue of agreement.

HIS HONOUR: All right well I don't know if we get to agreement because I don't think there's been a break.

PROSECUTOR: May it please the court.

HIS HONOUR: I don't think, I don't think that is that the - let me be specific. I don't think that there is any evidence apart from that of Sara Mitchell which I can't accept on the criminal standard that there was an agreement for a break to occur in light of the fact that Miss Trudgett was of the view that the house was generally left opened, that is unlocked but with doors closed. I take it to mean that is not actually expanded upon but that's what it would - I think that's the only inference that I could draw.

LAWRENCE: Your Honour the only submission that I would make in relation to that, just in case your Honour's minded to express some views in the alternative, your Honour is that even if you were satisfied, speaking hypothetical, is that it was a break to open an unlocked but closed door, in my submission you wouldn't be satisfied in any event beyond a reasonable doubt of an agreement that she had turned her mind sufficient to form an agreement to open a closed but unlocked door.

HIS HONOUR: Maybe a longer bow to draw but still on the same trajectory. Yes all right yes.

LAWRENCE: Your Honour the other submission is that if you weren't prepared to act on the evidence of Miss Mitchell that while you might certainly on the admissions find that assistance was rendered, that you wouldn't however be able to find beyond reasonable doubt an agreement to steal either, or your Honour she might be an aid and abetter through with knowledge driving the perpetrator to the scene but your Honour the submission is that's not the same thing as forming a joint agreement to commit an offence and your Honour this has been put as a case of a principle in the first degree so it is necessary of course to prove a joint agreement to commit the crime together and your Honour that is a different thing from aiding and abetting conduct which is what I understand to be principle in the second degree.

So if your Honour's minded to make those sort of findings in the alternative those are the two that I would also seek that the court find.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour on the same vein your Honour, if I may just - and I'll keep it brief. In relation to joint criminal enterprise I can hand up a case of Tangye ... it's an unreported decision of 8th and 10th of April 1997. I refer to the decision of Hunt CJ, Chief Justice at Common Law. It's at 556 your Honour. He outlines what he believes should be the jury directions which as I understand it is accepted and settled as directions in relation to joint criminal enterprise. Your Honour at point 2 at the bottom of the page he makes the point that,

""The joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and its existence may be inferred from the all the circumstances.""
...

HIS HONOUR: Look I'm not at all worried about that aspect of the case. I don't get there on my current position but if the element in relation to the break was made out I would be satisfied that there had been a joint criminal enterprise by way of inference in the case so I don't need to hear from you any further in that regard.

PROSECUTOR: The only other point I would make your Honour is in her interview at questions 51 and 52, the formal interview with Miss Trudgett, she makes reference that she thought Miss Mitchell was going to get jewellery. She also makes reference that the only persons who resided in the house apart from her and Miss Mitchell were a male called Bernie, a female whose name she didn't know and she couldn't give any further details of. The female provided a statement as to victim [Name]. Her statement at para 3 says that she's lived there for one and a half years and therefore encompassing the time that both the accused and Miss Mitchell lived there. At para 4 she states, ""I have a lock on my bedroom"", therefore there is a lock on the internal bedroom. Miss Trudgett's indicated jewellery as being the target of the property, she thought that it was jewellery that was going to be obtained.

Your Honour the only other submission I could make is the inference could be drawn that it was to obtain the jewellery from the female's room which she would have known to have been locked as it had been locked the entire time that she resided there or had a lock on the door. It's an internal door. Your Honour has case law supporting the proposition that to open an internal door is a break. That would be the only other submission I could put if your Honour was not satisfied as to the house itself being-

HIS HONOUR: All right so that because it was jewellery that was the subject of the alleged stealing is evidence that there is jewellery in a room that was locked.

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour-

HIS HONOUR: It might have been locked, they had a lock on the door.

PROSECUTOR: Had a lock on the door your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: A long bow too isn't it. Meaning the door may or may not being unlocked for...(not transcribable). I hear what you say, it's possible.

PROSECUTOR: I simply place that before you. It goes to the overall inference of being aware that - but if your Honour is against me in relation to an unlocked door-

HIS HONOUR: I'm afraid I am.

PROSECUTOR: -not being a break then-

HIS HONOUR: I'm conscious of the fact that-

PROSECUTOR: -I can't take it any higher.

HIS HONOUR: All right, all right thank you very much. I don't think need to hear from you any further I don't think Mr Lawrence.

12His Honour gave judgment thus:

HIS HONOUR: In the matter of Tamika Trudgett, Miss Trudgett was charged with breaking and entering a house and stealing therein. The case has been unusual in any number of respects. Firstly Miss Trudgett and Sara Mitchell the co-accused attended to police having decided to come forward about having committed the break and enter and there is certainly ample evidence that Sara Mitchell was involved in the break and enter, she has in fact been sentenced and already given evidence about it. Tamika Trudgett's role seems to be at first blush fairly clear, which was that she was the driver and was involved in some way or means in the discussion about what they were going to do. They were both needing money for amongst other things, the use of amphetamines at the relevant time. 

In any event admissions have been allowed into evidence despite a raft of objections which were very ably argued but quite complex to decide over a number of days and there is evidence certainly before me that Miss Trudgett by way of admissions was the driver and that she knew that Sara Mitchell was proposing to steal items from the house. At the very last moment it has become clear - to me at least at the very last moment - that there might be an issue in relation to the matter because of the element of breaking entering and stealing of breaking.

It is said that Miss Trudgett is a principal in the first degree in a joint criminal enterprise to break enter and steal the premises. Miss Mitchell of course has given evidence that she was involved in the discussion at the beginning, in the driving and indeed into advising her how it was best to enter the premises when she found the door of the house locked. And if I was to accept Miss Mitchell's evidence on the stand beyond reasonable doubt, which is of
course the standard I must apply to all of the evidence of the prosecution in this criminal hearing in the Local Court, then I would certainly have evidence that Miss Mitchell was involved as a principal in the first degree.

Miss Mitchell of course gave evidence in a manner which suggested to me that she was probably telling the truth, but I am not a human lie detector and the days of magistrates or judges for that matter are trying to apply their forensic skills to see wherever a witness is lying or not are I think probably largely behind us. It is a matter where I have to rely on objective evidence to see if the matter is proven beyond reasonable doubt, and it is a matter where of course Miss Mitchell is a person who is criminally concerned in matters. She received a benefit in relation to providing evidence for the prosecution in this matter in her sentence matter and indeed she has since this matter occurred
fallen out with Miss Trudgett.

There is absolutely no doubt that Miss Trudgett was involved in driving Miss Mitchell There is absolutely no doubt that she was involved in a joint criminal enterprise to steal property from the house, and indeed that that occurred and I note that she is also responsible for returning the property ultimately and for going forward to police. Which, apart from anything else, is as unusual as the fact that she came forward in the first place and suggests that she has a moral compass which it is irrelevant for me to go into, because the element of breaking in this case is not made out. The law is with respect ridiculous in this regard, as I think Justice Simpson alluded to in the decision which I have referred to earlier in this judgment.

Unless the structural integrity of a building externally is interfered with, that is a door which is left open and unlocked but closed is opened, the current state of the law as I read it, having regard to the case of Smith and the line of authority which Justice Simpson refers to, that follows is that that does not constitute a break of a house. Consequently as that element cannot be ""demonstrated to be within the contemplation of Miss Trudgett by evidence that I am prepared to accept beyond reasonable doubt, because in her record of interview with police she says that she thought that the house was generally left unlocked, and therefore it may have well be in her mind that Miss Mitchell could enter the house without legally breaking into it as the law currently stands. Then it is that the case of the prosecution must fail because that element remains unproven beyond reasonable doubt.

I should add that my decision of course is depended upon firstly my apprehension of the element of breaking being correct. And secondly my correct apprehension of that Miss Mitchell's evidence cannot be accepted beyond reasonable doubt even though I am inclined to the view that she was probably telling the truth on the civil standard. This is a criminal prosecution, the onus is on the prosecution to prove all of the elements of the offence including the offence of breaking on the standard of beyond reasonable doubt and until the legislature contemplates what it is that is meant by that and the Common Law remains as it stands it cannot be proven in this case that such an offence has occurred because of the absence of that element. 

Consequently Miss Trudgett is acquitted, not guilty.

The Identification of Error

13In this Court, Senior Counsel for the defendant accepted that his Honour erred and there was no substantial disagreement about the manner in which the case miscarried. 

14The principal matter of concern to his Honour was whether the breaking that undoubtedly occurred, that of the bathroom window, fell within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise of the defendant and Mitchell. His Honour erred in diverting himself instead into a consideration of whether opening a closed but unlocked door, something that never happened, would have constituted a breaking.

15In fact his Honour's view that to open a closed but unlocked door would not be to break was erroneous. In R v Walker (1978) 19 SASR 532, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia said this at 533: 

It is a breaking to push open a closed but unsecured door, or to open a closed but unfastened window.


16The result in R v Hyams (1836) 7 C& P 441 at 442; 173 ER 196 was to the same effect. That case was referred to by Simpson J, with whom Grove and Hulme JJ agreed, in R v Stanford [2007] NSWCCA370; (2007) 70 NSWLR 474. That was the judgment of Simpson J to which his Honour referred.

The Scope of the Joint Criminal Enterprise

17The doctrine of joint criminal enterprise provides the means of attaching liability for the agreed crime on all the parties to the agreement regardless of the part played by each in its execution: Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; (2013) 295 ALR 614 at [37] per the Court, citing McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 at 114; Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64 (2003) 219 CLR 1 at [110] per Hayne J. In its simplest application, the doctrine means that ""if a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement with another or others that they will commit a crime, and one or other of the parties to the arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, all are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission"": Gillard at [110] per Hayne J. However, as Hayne J observed in Gillard, the doctrine is not limited to the specific crime which the parties to the agreement intended to be committed. Quoting from the Court's earlier decision in McAuliffe, his Honour stated (at [111], footnotes omitted):

'[E]ach of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose'. The scope of the common purpose is to be determined subjectively: by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose. And '[w]hatever is comprehended by the understanding or arrangement, expressly or tacitly, is necessarily within the contemplation of the parties to the understanding or arrangement.'

18The culpability lies in participating in the joint criminal enterprise with the necessary foresight, consistently with the general principle that a person who intentionally assists in the commission of a crime or encourages its commission may be convicted as a party to it: McAuliffe at 118.

19The police prosecutor correctly referred his Honour to the statement of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Tangye at 556 -7 and would if permitted have gone further. Mr Lawrence, also, would if permitted have said more about joint criminal enterprise. Unfortunately, his Honour prevented the debate from continuing. The result was that his Honour failed to answer the question whether Mitchell's undoubted breaking fell within the scope of the enterprise. So the proceedings miscarried.

20His Honour appears to have accepted that the defendant and Mitchell had an understanding or arrangement that Mitchell would enter the house and steal. However, his Honour appears by his question to the Police Prosecutor to have considered that the scope of the agreement was limited by the evidence of what the defendant said in answer 56 of the interview, that when she and Mitchell lived at the house they ""used to leave it unlocked all the time."" That part of the answer to the question, whatever it meant, was relevant to the question his Honour had to answer, and its meaning was for his Honour to determine. But there was other evidence, namely:


The first part of answer 56, the effect of which was that the defendant did not know how Mitchell would gain entry;
Mitchell's evidence about her conversation with the defendant before she smashed the window. There was no evidence to contradict it; and
The probability that the defendant foresaw the need to break into the room where the goods were in view of the facts that:
(a)The occupant locked the room,

(b)The defendant had recently lived in the house and had been able to see how the occupant behaved;

(c)The defendant told the police that she thought Mitchell was ""more getting jewellery than laptops"" (answers 52-57); and

(d)All available inferences arising from any or all of these matters.

21I note that his Honour concluded that Mitchell was probably telling the truth, though because she was an accomplice he felt unable to accept her evidence beyond reasonable doubt. It is pertinent to observe, I think, that his Honour was not for that reason precluded from taking Mitchell's evidence into account. His Honour would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt only of any part of her evidence that went to an essential fact and was unsupported by other evidence: Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 583-585.

The Disposal of the Appeal

22By s 59(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 the Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to, inter alia, in s 56(1)(c) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just or by dismissing the appeal. Mr Nicholson SC submitted that the words ""may determine"" conferred a discretion to dismiss the appeal even after concluding that the order appealed from was vitiated by error. 

23An ordinary result of a finding of error is a remittal to the Local Court to permit the proceedings to be heard and determined according to law. But that is not an inevitable result and there are instances where this Court, having found error, has for reasons it has stated declined to remit, for example, Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Chresta (2005) 62 NSWLR 604 at [22]-[25] per Greg James J; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Fraser & O'Donnell [2008] NSWSC 244 at [24], [50]-[51] per Simpson J; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Majok [2009] NSWSC 192; 194 A Crim R 265 at [17]-[18] per Rothman J; Maritime Authority of NSW v Rofe [2012] NSWSC 5 at [104] - [108] per Brereton J.

24In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Wunderwald [2004] NSWSC 182, Sully J remitted a matter to the Local Court without finding it necessary finally to determine whether the discretion existed. His Honour was satisfied, however, that there was no discretion to dismiss an appeal, error having been shown, on the so-called ground of double jeopardy.

25In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Gramelis [2010] NSWSC 789 at [58], [59] Price J was not persuaded that the discretion existed but, in remitting the matter to the Local Court, stated that he would not in any event have exercised it.

26There are numerous other examples in which judges of the Court have remitted matters without deciding whether the discretion exists.

27The matters put forward by Mr Nicholson as justifying a dismissal of the appeal were these:


(i)An appeal under s 56 is like a Crown appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against sentence. In such appeals it is accepted that there exists a discretion to dismiss an appeal even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. This is because the primary purpose of such appeals is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts. As well, successful appeals bring with them an element of double jeopardy. Mr Nicholson referred to the remarks of the justices of the High Court of Australia in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49;
(ii) The 2 year time lapse between charging and finalisation of this appeal;
(iii)The stress experienced thus far by the defendant as the matter progressed before the Local Court - 15 months and 11 mention or hearing days;
(iv)The initial co-operation by the defendant with the police, including returning the property and going forward to police;
(v)As consequence of the defendant's action the victim's loss has been mitigated;
(vi)The defendant had no prior dealing with police and was a person of good character;
(vii)The defendant has had no subsequent dealings with police;
(viii)The co-accused received a bond pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a duration of two years. Given the lack of prior dealings with police it is likely that the defendant would have been dealt with similarly. A significant portion of that bond would have expired by the time this appeal is finalised;
(ix)The defendant was a young woman with no previous custodial experience;
(x)The defendant was promised by police that she wouldn't be charged with this matter regardless of what she said in her interview [ERISP Q&A 31 -33];
(xi)Apart from some petrol and speed there was no other gain from her involvement in the offence [ERISP Q & A 110 -111]; The error made by His Honour did not come about as consequence of defence submissions - indeed the defence conceded that the prosecutor was correct in his submission of what constituted a break; and
(xii)Mr Lawrence was unable to fully develop his arguments in respect of the absence of foresight of damage to property at the hearing in January 2013.

28Two of these matters call for particular comment. The first is the comparison with sentence appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal. While every judgment on appeal governs the court appealed from and should provide guidance to that court, appeals under s 56 have not, as far as I am aware, been said to have the didactic quality contended for. I do not find attractive the contention that a successful appeal should not lead to a retrial on the ground that the retrial itself might be unfair or oppressive because of so-called double jeopardy. To allow the operation of such a principle would seem to me to strike at the reason why s 56 exists. I apprehend that it exists to allow the Court to put right what has gone wrong. I respectfully agree with the remarks of Sully J in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Wunderwald at [33]-[37] thus:

[33] I have twice referred to a perceived entitlement ""in principle"" on the part of the plaintiff to some relief. That has been because of a submission put by learned counsel for the first defendant to the effect that the power conferred by s 59(2) of the Appeal and Review Act is a discretionary power akin to the discretionary power reposing in the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

[34] The submission is, that is to say, that even in a case in which this Court finds that there have been errors of law apt to vitiate the relevant order of the Local Court, there remains in this Court nevertheless an overriding discretion to refuse relief because of what is conventionally described as ""double jeopardy"".

[35] Insofar as I have been persuaded that the learned Magistrate did make an error of law apt to vitiate her Worship's order, I accept at once that no fault in that connection can be laid at the feet of Mr Wunderwald. I accept as of course that it is only to be expected that he will be certainly disappointed, and probably indignant, to think that the order dismissing the information laid against him is defective in law, and that there opens up before him the prospect of a rehearing in the Local Court.

[36] As to all of those considerations, I would say this: I am not persuaded that the words ""may determine"" which appear in s 59(2) of the Appeal and Review Act do confer an overriding discretion of the kind to which the submissions of learned counsel for the first defendant refer. It is, however, unnecessary to determine finally that point, because even if I were persuaded that the statutory expression carried with it such an overriding discretion, I would not think it right to exercise such a discretion adversely to the plaintiff in the present proceedings.

[37] If it be correct to suppose that a Local Court magistrate has made an order vitiated by fundamental error of law; and more so, if one of those fundamental errors of law is a failure to accord procedural fairness to the prosecution; then I cannot suppose it to be correct, either in principle or in practice, to refuse to intervene in order to correct such a state of affairs. To do so would be, in my view, not to give effect to the statute, but to deprive it of the effect which, as it seems to me, the Legislature clearly intended that it should have.

29The second matter deserving of comment is the assertion that the interviewing police officer told the defendant that she would not be prosecuted for this matter. I notice that the defendant was represented by careful and capable practitioners throughout her trial. They raised a number of matters in their thorough but ultimately unsuccessful objections to the tender of the transcript of the interview between the defendant and Detective Sergeant Scott. 

30I think that the submissions in this Court are based on a misunderstanding of what happened and what was said. As I have said, Detective Sergeant Scott interviewed the defendant in another part of the police station before this interview began. A particular matter was mentioned. It was referred to in questions and answers 31 and 32. The defendant's unresponsive remark recorded as an answer to question 38 confirms that the two had discussed another offence, possibly one that had some features in common with the present offence. It sufficiently appears that the defendant denied any responsibility for it. In my opinion the remarks of Detective Sergeant Scott recorded at Questions 31 and 32 were intended to inform the defendant that she was not to be charged with the matter previously discussed. The Statement made by Detective Sergeant Scott on 14 February 2012 shows that a recording was made of things said by the defendant and Mitchell on the earlier occasion but it does not disclose any other offence, and it appears possible that things were said but not recorded. The recording was not tendered. The charge the subject of this appeal was the only charge brought against the defendant. 

31Those representing the defendant at trial would have read the transcript of her interview. They had read Detective Sergeant Scott's statement. They would have taken instructions from the defendant. She would presumably have told them what would had been discussed in the other part of the police station. She might have said something about questions and answers 31 and 32. She might have told them what she meant by the answer recorded at 38. They did not submit that Detective Sergeant Scott had told the defendant, or that the defendant understood, that she would not be charged with the offence subject of this appeal. Although the evidence before this Court does not reveal the subject-matter referred to in answers 31, 32 and 38, all the known facts combine to show that it was not the offence with which the hearing was concerned.

32It is not surprising that this matter was not raised below. I think that it has no substance.

33I have considered the other matters put forward as possibly justifying a dismissal of the appeal. I will not deal with them individually. They do not combine to persuade me to exercise any existing discretion in the manner contended for. In my opinion justice will be done if the matter is remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.

34 In my opinion it would be unjust if Mitchell, the offender who confessed to the police and pleaded guilty, were the only one of the two dealt with by the court. I doubt whether, if that were the result, Mitchell would consider that justice had been done. She would be entitled to feel aggrieved, and if she did she would have no redress. Although the offence was not a serious one of its kind, it is important that those apprehended for breaking, entering, stealing and disposing of goods to feed their drug addictions be manifestly dealt with for those offences. 

35I make the following orders:

(1)Allow the appeal;
(2)Order pursuant to s 59(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, that the order of Magistrate A. Eckhold made on 31 January 2013 at Dubbo Local Court dismissing proceedings commenced against the defendant for the offence of break and enter residential dwelling and steal property therein be set aside;
(3)Order that the matter be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.

36Although costs were sought in the Summons, the plaintiff did not press the application. I make no order as to costs.

		12 November 2013",2013-11-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762674,R v Kearnes (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1652,"Judgment
1On 2 September 2013, Peter John Kearnes (to whom I shall refer in these remarks as ""the offender"") was arraigned before a jury panel and me on an indictment averring that, on 21 July 2011 at Wagga Wagga, he murdered Semin Rizvic (to whom I shall refer as ""the deceased"").  On 19 September 2013, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on that single count.  On that same day, and later on 7 November 2013, I received evidence on sentence, and on the latter date the detailed and helpful submissions of both counsel.  The culmination of those procedural steps is that the offender comes before court for sentence today.  
2The maximum penalty for the offence of murder in New South Wales is imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.  In the circumstances of this case, there is also an applicable standard non-parole period of 20 years.  I have borne those two important guideposts firmly in mind.  The Crown Prosecutor has not submitted that this is a case that should lead to the imposition of the maximum penalty.  
Fact finding
3My approach to the determination of the facts of the matter is as follows.  Any fact that I regard as adverse to the offender must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.  A fact that I regard to be in his favour need be proven on the balance of probabilities only.  It may be that the evidence will not permit me to determine some facts with clarity.  It is not my role to try to construe the findings of fact that may have underpinned the verdict of the jury.  Rather, I must make my own findings, consistent with that verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587.
4The task of fact finding in this matter is complicated by two factors.  
5The first is that I recently finished presiding in a trial with regard to a co-offender, Mr Paton.  Although the offence alleged was identical, the issues and evidence, as one would expect, were different to some degree.  With the assistance of counsel, I have put out of my mind all of the evidence tendered in the trial of Mr Paton, and based all of my findings of fact solely on the evidence in the trial and proceedings on sentence of the offender. 
6Secondly, the two most important witnesses in the Crown case in the trial of the offender were Ms Tamsin Cameron and Mr John Holschier.  And yet it is agreed between the parties that each of them told at least one significant lie in the witness box.  I respectfully accept that proposition.  That fact, and my generally adverse assessment of the credibility of both of those witnesses, has led me to approach their assertions with the utmost caution.  With regard to many topics, I have simply put their evidence to one side.  
Objective features
7On 20 July 2011, the deceased was living in a modest ground floor Housing Commission flat on a main street of Wagga Wagga.  He lived alone, although he did enjoy the companionship of his dog ""Jabba"".  The deceased suffered from a longstanding problem with prohibited drugs.  He was also a vulnerable person who was frequently the victim of assaults, robberies, and the like.  
8The deceased had been in an intermittent relationship with the former wife of the offender, Ms Vicki Kearnes.  On the afternoon of 20 July 2011, the offender travelled from Tumut to Wagga Wagga and dropped in at a birthday celebration in honour of Ms Vicki Kearnes.  There he expressed the belief to Ms Vicki Kearnes that she and the deceased were ""still together"".  She told him, in effect, to mind his own business.  
9In the early evening, the offender travelled by motor vehicle back to his home in Tumut.  At that location he was later in the company of his friend, Mr Paton, and Ms Cameron, with whom he had some sort of association.  All three were part of the community of users of methylamphetamine in that small country town.  
10In the living room of that home was a shortened .22 calibre rifle.  It was in the possession of the offender.  So was at least one box of ammunition suitable for use in that firearm.  
11The offender and Mr Paton travelled together in a motor vehicle to the home of an acquaintance, Mr Peter Minogue, who also lived in Tumut.  The two of them brought Mr Minogue back to the home of the offender.  
12Thereafter the offender and Mr Paton left those premises, taking with them the firearm and the ammunition.  The two men did not leave the Tumut area, however, until some time after 2:30am on 21 July 2011.  Before leaving the house, one or other of them asked Ms Cameron to monitor a police scanner that was present in the home.  That request was made because at that stage, I am satisfied, the offender and Mr Paton had entered into an agreement that they would travel to Wagga Wagga and murder the deceased.  
13In undertaking that journey, the two men used the Ford Territory belonging to Ms Cameron, even though there was a vehicle belonging to the offender available.  The drive to Wagga Wagga from Tumut takes no less than one hour.  
14The offender and the deceased were known to each other, and, although by no means great friends, they were on reasonable terms.  Some time shortly before 4am, the deceased, who was alone, permitted entry into his flat to the offender, and perhaps to Mr Paton as well.  Thereafter the deceased sat on his couch in a relaxed manner.  
15Almost immediately, either the offender or Mr Paton produced the shortened firearm and shot the deceased to the neck from very close range.  That first wound was rapidly fatal, and it is not the case that the deceased suffered for an extended period before his death.  
16Thereafter, three more shots were administered to the head of the deceased.  During that process, but after the deceased had expired, in an act both contemptuous and contemptible, the left ear and a portion of the scalp of the deceased were severed from his head.  At some later stage it was discarded in the garden of the block of flats like a piece of rubbish.  
17Despite my suspicions, I am not able to be satisfied to the criminal standard that the offender was the shooter.  Nor am I satisfied that the offender was the person who mutilated the body of the deceased after the murder.  I am satisfied to the requisite degree that the offender was the moving party in the murder, and that Mr Paton was either his assistant in the offender doing those things, or that Mr Paton did them at the instigation of the offender.
18There can be no question but that the offender intended to kill at the time of the shooting.  
19Afterwards the two men remained in the vicinity of the murder for quite some time.  I am unable to determine why they did so.  
20Eventually they travelled to the Tumblong area between Wagga Wagga and Tumut, where by arrangement they met Ms Cameron.  At that location they changed cars and clothes and discarded certain items in an effort to hide their crime, before returning to Tumut.  
21Later on 21 July 2011, the offender and Mr Paton decided to absent themselves from Tumut and the South West Slopes of New South Wales generally.  They decided to head north together, to Sydney or perhaps further.  In an act of incompetence, they caused themselves to be pulled over by the Highway Patrol at Yass.  At that time, the driver, Mr Paton, was speeding and not displaying his L plates.  The offender was sitting in the passenger seat drunk. 
22Some time later, the offender engaged in a recorded interview with police.  He chose to tell many lies on that occasion.  
23There was evidence in the trial that, after the murder, the accused attempted to murder Mr Paton, for fear that he would reveal the truth about the crime to the authorities.  There was also evidence that, at a still later time, the offender sought to have Ms Cameron murdered by way of a contract killing.  After discussion in the proceedings on sentence, the learned Crown Prosecutor accepted that I should not have regard to those matters as aggravating the murder for which the offender is to be sentenced.  Although he did submit that they could be relevant to the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender, he came to the final position that they were not matters about which I could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, in light of the lack of credibility of the two witnesses to whom I referred a moment ago.  I respectfully agree with that submission, and I have accordingly put the evidence of those allegations to one side.  
24The foregoing recital of the objective features reveals that this murder cannot be characterised as anything other than an extremely grave example of the offence.  
Subjective features
25The offender has maintained his innocence of the offence.  He ran a trial, as (of course) he was perfectly entitled to do.  Since then, there has been no evidence of acceptance of responsibility on his part in the slightest.  Indeed, he recently maintained his innocence to a forensic psychiatrist.  
26Turning to the question of motive, the Crown case at trial was that the offender was upset as a result of his belief that his former wife was still in a relationship with the deceased.  It may be that the offender was indeed unhappy about that supposed state of affairs.  And yet the relationship between Ms Vicki Kearnes and the deceased had been ""on again off again"" for years.  Furthermore, I do not accept that the interaction between the offender and Ms Vicki Kearnes on the afternoon of 20 July 2011 led him very shortly thereafter to commit this premeditated murder.  
27I suspect that this murder was, in truth, to do with prohibited drugs, or money derived from prohibited drugs.  However, in light of the absence of evidence founding that proposition, I do not come to any finding in that regard.  
28In short, I do not consider that I am able to discern with any clarity the motive for the commission of this crime.  
29The evidence of the background of the offender is derived chiefly from a history that he provided to the forensic psychiatrist.  There was little oral evidence in support of that history, and there was none from the offender in support of it.  As I have indicated, I am satisfied that the offender told the police a number of lies when he was interviewed.  It is also the case that he gave evidence (to which I shall return) in the trial that I do not accept as mitigating on the balance of probabilities.  For those reasons, I have approached anything said by the offender to the psychiatrist with considerable caution.  On reflection, however, I am prepared to accept matters of background on the balance of probabilities.  
30The offender was born 52 years ago in Tasmania.  He did not have the good fortune to be born into a happy, loving home.  To the contrary, his father had a serious drinking problem.  He was regularly violent to the mother of the offender, events that the offender witnessed as a child, as well as to the offender himself and his siblings.  On many occasions, the offender adopted the strategy of hiding in order to avoid being subjected to beatings.  The family moved around frequently, and the offender attended many different schools.  He was suspended and expelled from school on a number of occasions. 
31I do not doubt that that early trauma permanently scarred the personality of the offender, and played a significant role in the subsequent development of his problems with prohibited drugs and alcohol, as well as his serious criminality.  
32From an early age, the offender has been a heavy drinker.  He has also used cannabis and amphetamines.  He has also, on occasions, abused prescription medication.  
33I accept on the balance of probabilities that, on the evening of 20 July and in the early hours of the morning of 21 July 2011, the offender was affected by a combination of alcohol, amphetamines, and prescription medication.  I accept to the same standard that that combination disinhibited him and made him more impetuous and aggressive than he otherwise would have been.  And yet all of those effects were very well known to the offender, in light of his years of abuse of drugs and alcohol. In the circumstances, that intoxication cannot operate to mitigate the offence.
34The psychiatrist who recently saw the offender came to the opinion that he is suffering from a dependence upon alcohol, a substance use disorder with regard to amphetamines and prescription medication, and ""maladaptive personality traits"".  I accept that evidence.  And I also accept the opinion of the psychiatrist that at no relevant time has the offender suffered from any significant cognitive impairment, any illness in the nature of psychosis, or any emotional problems such as depression.  
35The offender commenced to offend at the age of 14 years, when he was placed on probation for property offences.  His criminal record is thereafter peppered with offences of dishonesty and violence, along with driving offences, many of the latter supportive of the proposition that there has been an ongoing problem with alcohol.  Many of those offences are not of the greatest seriousness.
36There are two exceptions to that.  The first is that, in 1982, the offender was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 2 years for his role in an armed robbery in company.  It seems that, with remissions, the offender served about 18 months for that offence.  
37The second is that, in 1993, the offender pleaded guilty in the District Court at Albury to a number of very serious offences arising from the one extended incident.  They were one count of armed robbery, two counts of false imprisonment, and one count of sexual intercourse without consent.  The agreed facts of that matter were tendered before me.  There is no need for me to review them in detail.  It suffices to say that the offender engaged in terrifying acts of violence, including sexual violence, whilst disguised and armed with a knife, against a defenceless middle-aged couple.  No doubt throughout their extended ordeal each of them was in fear of death.  As a result of his pleas of guilty, the offender was convicted and received a total head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a total non-parole period of 8 years.  It seems that the offender was released in the year 2000, at the end of his non-parole period.  
38In the proceedings on sentence in 1993, a psychiatric report was tendered on behalf of the offender in which it was recorded that the offender gave a history of suffering ""alcoholic blackouts"" at the time of those offences.  An eminent forensic psychiatrist expressed the opinion that that was indeed possible, whilst not actively endorsing it.  
39It is noteworthy that, in the trial conducted before me, the offender gave similar evidence that, at the crucial times before, during and after the murder, he was suffering another blackout, or at least complete amnesia, this time caused by a combination of prescription medication and alcohol.
40One must seriously doubt the truthfulness of each of those assertions.  The amnesia said to have been suffered with regard to the events of 20 and 21 July 2011 was remarkably convenient chronologically.  It is also noteworthy that the accused said nothing about such a blackout, or any history of previous blackouts, in the subsequent recorded interview with the police to which I have referred.  Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest in the behaviour of the offender, before, during or after the shooting, that he was in any way psychologically or mentally impaired.  
41On the other hand, it can be said that, in 1993, the offender did not rely upon the alleged blackout in exculpation of his crimes (although I infer that it was relied upon in mitigation to some degree).  And in 2013, the evidence of the alleged blackout or amnesia in 2011 was hardly likely to aid the offender, in the sense of causing the jury to possess a reasonable doubt about his guilt.
42At first, I thought that I should approach the recent evidence of the blackout as nothing more than an attempted exculpatory lie, and therefore something adverse to the offender, at the least with regard to his prospects of rehabilitation.  But on reflection, I cannot be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt.  On the other hand, nor do I accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender was suffering from any sort of blackout at any stage relevant to this murder.  In the event, I put the evidence with regard to blackouts to one side, and regard it as neither a matter in mitigation or aggravation.  
43Returning to matters of background, some years ago the marriage between the offender and his first wife, Ms Vicki Kearnes, came to an end.  They had a number of sons together, and some of them gave evidence in the trial, though not on sentence.  I infer that he maintains a good relationship with at least some of his children.
44Between his release in 2000 and his commission of this murder in 2011, the offender generally (though not completely) stayed out of trouble.   During that period, he enjoyed the benefit of a loving relationship with Ms Janelle Kearnes, his second wife.  She gave evidence before me on sentence of her continuing love for the offender, the admirable qualities he demonstrated over the decade in which they were together, and in particular his fulfilment of the role of father to her own children.  Although their romantic relationship broke up in early 2011 due in part to his abuse of prohibited drugs, she gave impressive evidence of her determination to ""stick by him"" during the years ahead.  It is also the case that the mother and sister of the offender travelled a considerable distance to attend court.  No doubt all of that love and support will assist in his rehabilitation.  
45Furthermore, I infer that the offender will be able to use his time in custody in the years ahead constructively.  It seems that he has been a worker during his current period of incarceration, and the Crown did not put any evidence of offences against prison discipline before me.  It is to be hoped that the offender will be given, and take, the opportunity finally to address the underlying emotional damage that he suffered as a child and adolescent and that has played its part in his abuse of alcohol and prohibited drugs, and the commission of this murder.
46Finally, when the offender becomes eligible for release, he will by no means be a young man.  That fact may operate to reduce his tendency to commit profoundly anti-social acts of violence against other persons. 
47Having said that, in all of the circumstances to which I have referred, one can only be very guarded about the prospects of rehabilitation of Mr Kearnes.
Various matters
48I do not propose mechanistically to state the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  Nor do I propose to review the reasons for my departure from the standard non-parole period.  In both cases, these remarks on sentence fulfil that role.  
49In light of the maturity and criminal record of the offender, and in particular the inevitable length of any parole period, I do not find special circumstances that could lead to a reduction in the non-parole period.  
50Finally, I am required by recent legislation to inform the offender that, even though I shall impose a determinate sentence, he may be detained after the complete expiry of that sentence, if it is considered that his rehabilitation is insufficient and he remains a danger to the community.
Moral blameworthiness
51In short, the offender was the instigator of a murder in which a vulnerable and trusting victim was heartlessly shot to death in his own home.  The intention was to kill.  Thereafter the body was mutilated.  The crime was premeditated and included two confederates.  It was also brazen, in that it was a shooting committed in an occupied apartment block on a main road of a large regional city.  The offender has expressed not the slightest remorse.  Despite his damaging upbringing, he does not suffer from any mental illness.  The offender has previously been incarcerated for a lengthy period for offences of great cruelty and brutality.  In assessing the moral blameworthiness of the offender and his offending as a whole, permit me to use an old-fashioned word and say that the murder of Semin Rizvic was a crime of great wickedness.  The criminal justice system must respond with a sentence of appropriate severity.
Imposition of sentence
52Peter John Kearnes, you are convicted of the offence of murder.  I sentence you to a non-parole period of 22 years 6 months to date from 3 October 2011, with a balance of term of 7 years 6 months to date from 3 April 2034 and expire on 2 October 2041.  The first date upon which you will be eligible for parole is 2 April 2034.
53To be clear, the offender is subject to a head sentence of imprisonment for 30 years with a non-parole period of 22 years 6 months.

2762676,R v Grogan [2013] NSWSC 1643,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Jason Mark Grogan (""the offender"") stands for sentence for the crime of murder.  On 10 January 2012 at Gloucester, he seriously assaulted a 72 year old man, Mr Alan Henry.  Mr Henry suffered significant brain damage, was hospitalised, and sadly died on 19 April 2012.  The offender was found guilty by a jury in a trial at Port Macquarie last August.
2The crime of murder is punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.  There is a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  It has not been suggested that this is a case where the maximum penalty should be imposed.  But it, and the standard non-parole period, are relevant as guideposts to be considered alongside all of the facts and circumstances of the case.
Facts
3Mr Henry lived in a house in Gregson Street, Gloucester.  He had been living there alone since his partner passed away in early 2010.  At some stage in about early 2011 Mr Henry became acquainted with Natasha Slacke.  She assumed a part-time carer role for him, doing chores such as shopping and house cleaning in return for payment.  She lived at Port Stephens with her boyfriend, the offender.  
4Sometime during the first half of 2011 the offender began to accompany Ms Slacke on her trips to Gloucester.  The trio socialised together by going to local hotels.  In mid-2011, Mr Henry was hospitalised for about a fortnight following eye surgery.  The offender and Ms Slacke stayed at his home in order to take care of his dogs.
5A day or two after Mr Henry returned home from hospital there was what was described as ""a big argument"".  A neighbour heard him tell the offender to ""get out and don't come back"".  Ms Slacke continued to visit him but the offender was effectively barred from entering the home.  He would drive Ms Slacke there and pick her up later.
6On 10 January 2012, the offender and Ms Slacke travelled from Port Stephens to Gloucester in order for her to visit Mr Henry.  At about 4.30pm to 5.00pm they were at a service station about 250 metres from Mr Henry's home.  They were seen by a number of witnesses to be engaged in a very heated argument.  The situation was so inflamed that bystanders were prompted to physically intervene out of concern that the offender might harm Ms Slacke.  The Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury that the offender's state of mind was one of agitation, anger and aggression.  I do not think the jury would have had any difficulty accepting that submission.
7After the situation came under control, Ms Slacke was on the phone talking to Mr Henry.  She passed the phone to a police officer who had been flagged down by a motorist.  The officer, Senior Constable Broadley, spoke to Mr Henry and asked him whether he had any problem with Ms Slacke's stated intention of coming to his home to stay.  Mr Henry replied, ""Yeah, that's fine, as long as her boyfriend's not with her.  He's an absolute arsehole and isn't welcome here"".  
8The offender left the scene while the officer was talking to Ms Slacke.  He proceeded directly to Mr Henry's home.  He entered by climbing over the back fence from a rear lane.  He was seen by a neighbour to be bobbing up and down; I accept that he was trying to conceal his presence.  But when the neighbour's husband asked him what he was doing, he replied to the effect that he was just urinating against the fence.  The neighbours then went about their business.  The offender must then have proceeded to the back door of Mr Henry's home and entered.  It was claimed that he knocked before he entered; but one of the neighbours heard this as ""banging"" or ""thuds"", ""about six to eight of them"". 
9There was no direct evidence about what occurred inside the home.  A subsequent crime scene examination revealed little to assist.  What is known is that the offender must only have been inside the home for a matter of minutes.  He took Mr Henry's laptop computer and left via the back door.  He climbed over the rear fence and fled down the laneway.
10Senior Constable Broadley was patrolling the area in his police car.  At about 5.30pm he noticed a man in the laneway carrying something so he stopped, reversed and drove into the laneway.  The offender jumped over the back fence of another property, dropped the laptop, and ran off through a neighbouring property.
11Ms Slacke arrived at Mr Henry's home a short time later.  At 5.31pm, she called triple 0.  An ambulance was despatched and arrived at 5.50pm.  Paramedics found Mr Henry lying face down on the kitchen floor with his arms by his sides, palms up.  He was unconscious and there was a large pool of blood around his head.  Another paramedic was despatched to assist as were members of the local fire brigade.  Eventually Mr Henry was taken by ambulance to the local hospital where he was stabilised before being conveyed by air ambulance to Westmead Hospital and admitted to the intensive care unit.
12Towards the end of March 2012, Mr Henry was transferred to a nursing home at Erina.  He died on 19 April 2012 from a complication of his incapacitation as a result of the severe brain injury he had sustained.
13The offender was arrested on 17 January 2012.  He was charged with what I assume was a serious assault offence but the charge was upgraded to murder on 4 May 2012 following Mr Henry's death.  He was interviewed on both of those occasions.  He told a number of lies in those interviews and so no more needs to be said about them except to say that he denied assaulting Mr Henry.  The jury's verdict establishes the contrary.
14The forensic pathologist who gave evidence in the trial, Dr Brian Beer, explained that the most probable mechanism by which Mr Henry sustained his injuries was that he received a punch or a blow to the right side of his forehead causing a contusion.  This blow caused him to go down and he either hit the left side of his head on some object as he was falling or when he hit the floor.  Whilst Dr Beer conceded that it was possible that Mr Henry did not become unconscious until he hit the floor, it seems more likely that he was rendered unconscious by the initial blow.
Seriousness of the offence
15The Crown case on murder was put to the jury in two ways.  One was that the accused struck Mr Henry to the right side of the forehead and that he did this with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.  The other way was what lawyers call ""constructive murder""; in short, doing an act which causes death during the commission of a very serious criminal offence, in this case, aggravated robbery with wounding. 
16It is impossible and unnecessary to known which path was taken by the jury to the verdict of guilty, or whether some jurors arrived at the verdict by one path while others took the alternative route.  It is my task to determine the basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced, with the only constraint being that I do so in a manner which is consistent with the jury's verdict of guilty of murder.
17The act of the offender that substantially contributed to the death of the deceased was a single punch.  Often, that factor would tend to militate against a conclusion that there was an intention to cause really serious bodily harm.  But there are other matters to take into account. The offender was, I accept, in a heightened state of anger and aggression.  He was much younger and undoubtedly stronger than the comparatively elderly Mr Henry.  He struck Mr Henry to the head and he did so in a manner that caused him to immediately go to the ground.
18I acknowledge that it was Dr Beer's evidence that the degree of force required to produce the type of injury Mr Henry sustained to his right forehead is difficult to gauge.  Mr Henry's age, and the possible influence of medication he might have been taking, meant that less force would have been required to cause such injury in that location.  Nevertheless, Dr Beer offered the opinion that ""moderate force"" or ""a decent sort of punch"" was involved.
19Having regard to all of these circumstances I am satisfied that the offender had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Henry.  This is the finding that was advocated on behalf of both the Crown and the offender in their submissions on sentence.
20The reason why the offender did this is not clear.  Indeed, the reason why he went to Mr Henry's home in the first place is not clear.  I am satisfied that there was a level of animosity between the pair (the degree being difficult to determine) for the preceding six months.  He must have known that he would not have been welcome.  And he certainly would not have been welcomed having regard to what Mr Henry said to Senior Constable Broadley a short time before.  The manner in which the offender entered the property is indicative of him being up to no good.  This was quite obviously not a friendly social call.
21It is possible that the offender went to the home intending to physically harm Mr Henry.  He was in quite a volatile and aggressive emotional state.  It is also possible that he intended to steal from him, which in fact he did.  A third possibility is that he intended both.  The evidence is insufficient to enable me to make a finding beyond reasonable doubt about any of those three possibilities.  It is difficult, however, to envisage some realistic alternative. 
22What is clear is that the offender went to Mr Henry's home, a 72 year old man who he knew lived alone. He must have known that he would not be welcome.  He banged at the back door, entered and very soon after struck a forceful blow to Mr Henry's head with the intention of causing him really serious harm.  He then stole property from the house and fled, leaving Mr Henry unconscious on the kitchen floor with callous disregard for how seriously he might have been injured.
23All murders are serious; but the seriousness of a specific case is relative.  If one were to adopt a broad view as to what the middle of the range of objective seriousness is, that is where I would place the present case.  
The offender's personal circumstances
24The information I have in relation to the offender's personal circumstances is largely derived from a report by Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, and documents relating to the offender's criminal and custodial history.
25He was born in 1970 and so he was aged 41 at the time of the offence. He was the youngest of four children and was brought up in the Coffs Harbour region.  He was educated to Year 10 and then commenced a carpentry apprenticeship.  His employment history has been in the building and fishing industries.  He has three children from past relationships who are aged 13, 14 and 18.  He has some physical health issues but nothing of any particular significance.
26Drug abuse has been a feature of his life since he commenced using cannabis at around age 15.  He tried amphetamine at about age 24 and has used that drug intermittently over the years.  He has used heroin from about that time as well and he told Dr Nielssen that it was his ""drug of choice"".  He had entered two drug rehabilitation facilities; had completed a number of courses; and had undergone counselling.  He had been abstemious for two years but relapsed in the year before the offence.  He had not, however, consumed any alcohol or taken any drugs on the day.
27The offender also told Dr Nielssen about past admissions to psychiatric facilities when he had exhibited symptoms of schizophrenia-like psychosis.  He denied any recent symptoms and attributed his past symptoms to drug use.
28Dr Nielssen made the psychiatric diagnoses of ""substance dependence and abuse disorder"" and ""recurrent drug-induced psychosis, currently in remission"".  He also considered the possibility of an underlying schizophrenic illness and possible traumatic brain injury but largely discounted them.  He recommended further psychiatric evaluation and further treatment for depression and psychosis as required, but that was with the rider: ""based on the limited information that is available"".  He also recommended that the offender undergo long term drug counselling and monitoring of abstinence from substance use.
29Unsurprisingly, given his history of drug abuse, the offender has a criminal record.  He has been convicted of offences in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. There are many entries for crimes of violence and crimes involving dishonesty.  The entries appear at regular intervals from when he was 17 years of age.  This history demonstrates that he has led a life marked by a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, disdain of authority and disrespect for society. An aggravating factor is that the offender was the subject of a number of bonds to be of good behaviour at the time he murdered Mr Henry.
30He was charged with an offence of taking and driving a car without the consent of its owner and was sentenced on 8 May 2012 to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 8 months.  The sentence was backdated to the day of his arrest, 17 January 2012.  This means that for the first 8 months of the time he has been in custody he was serving the non-parole period of that sentence.  He has been in custody solely because of the present matter since 17 September 2012. I have a discretion as to the extent to which the sentence I impose is to be backdated to take account of pre-sentence custody.  It was common ground that an appropriate exercise of this discretion would be to commence the sentence at a point half way through the non-parole period for that sentence, namely 17 May 2012. 
31There are some positive things that can be derived from the criminal and custodial history documentation.  The offender has not incurred any disciplinary infractions in any New South Wales gaol since 1991.  (I was not provided with any information about his behaviour in gaols in other states.)  He has completed two vocational courses in this current period of custody and has applied to complete his ""Tertiary Preparation"" studies.  And he has been employed since 28 May this year in the education department in the gaol where he is presently being held.
Deterrence and other purposes of sentencing
32General deterrence is obviously important in sentencing for murder but in the circumstances of this particular case it is also important to mark the seriousness with which the courts seek to protect the community's senior citizens from violent offences committed by intruders into their homes.  Those who are minded to commit such an offence should be left in no doubt that the courts will deal with them harshly.
33Deterrence of the offender himself is also a significant matter.  His record of dishonesty and violence, which are both features of this offence, warrants emphasis to this particular aspect of the sentencing matrix.  Punishment, denunciation of his conduct, making him accountable for his actions, and recognising the harm he has caused are sentencing purposes that are also important.
34Promotion of the offender's rehabilitation, another purpose of sentencing, is problematic.  It was not submitted that I should find that he is remorseful, nor that his prospects of rehabilitation are good and nor that he is unlikely to re-offend.  But was submitted that I should find special circumstances so as to enlarge the proportion of the sentence represented by the parole period at the expense of the non-parole period. This submission was based upon the proposition that it was in the public interest for the offender to have an extended period of supervision within the community to assist him with substance abuse and mental health issues.
35I do not accept that there should be a finding of special circumstances.  The potential period of parole that would be allowed by imposing a sentence in the usual proportions should be more than adequate to assist the offender in his eventual reintegration into the community. The evidence as to his mental health is to the effect that he has only experienced difficulties when abusing drugs.  By the time he becomes eligible for release on parole he will have spent a considerable period in what should be a drug free environment.
Victim impact statement
36A victim impact statement by Mr Henry's daughter, Ms Susan Henry, was read.  The effect upon her, emotionally and otherwise, of losing her beloved father in such circumstances has been nothing short of profound.  It is remarkable then that Ms Henry has managed to think beyond her own intense grief to the wider ramifications in the community.  She has given me permission to quote the last paragraph of her statement:
I can only pray that my father's death can become a legacy to all citizens to be mindful of the choices that they make and the consequential impact those decisions have on the lives of their fellow citizens and families.  I believe this is the greatest gift we as humans can give to one another.
37I thank Ms Henry for sharing with me, the court, and the community the impact the offender's actions and the loss of her father has had. 
Sentence
38Convicted.
39Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 years with a balance of the term of the sentence of 6 years.
40The sentence is to date from 17 May 2012.  The first day the offender will become eligible for release on parole is 17 May 2030.

		08 November 2013",2013-11-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762677,Greenaway v R [2013] NSWCCA 270,"Judgment

1GLEESON JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: William Greenaway (""the applicant"") applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Parramatta by his Honour Judge Toner SC on 30 April 2010. 

3The applicant had pleaded guilty to offences of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (s 24(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) - maximum penalty imprisonment for life and/or a fine of 5000 penalty units) and possessing a precursor intended for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (s 24A(1) of the same Act - maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units).

4Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides for a standard non-parole period of 15 years for the manufacturing offence.

5The applicant was sentenced to 15 years 6 months for the manufacturing offence and 4 years for the precursor offence. Both sentences were specified to date from 8 January 2008; he had been in custody since his arrest on that date. The judge set a non-parole period for the first offence with mathematical precision so that it was exactly three quarters of the total term, 11 years 7 months and 15 days. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 22 August 2019.

6A notice of application for leave to appeal was filed on 18 April 2013, almost 3 years after the applicant was sentenced. Such delay is deplorable but the Registrar has granted an extension of time so there is no need for the Court to concern itself with that aspect.

7The sole ground of appeal concerns only the manufacturing offence and it relates to how the sentencing judge took into account the prescription of the standard non-parole period. In short, it is contended that there has been Muldrock error: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock"").

Facts

8As best as I can determine (the lengthy statement of facts is hardly a model of clarity), police and the Australian Crime Commission investigated the involvement of the applicant and a number of other men in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. The applicant and Alan George Reardon were the principals. David Gerald McGreevy and Jake Callager were described by the judge as ""playing relatively minor subordinate or collateral roles"". 

9Search warrants were executed at a number of addresses and arrests were made on 8 January 2008. A working clandestine laboratory was found at an address in Annangrove. Some 5.8 kilograms of methylamphetamine had been manufactured. A quantity of pseudoephedrine weighing 14.6 kilograms, the subject of the precursor offence, was also found. Items associated with drug manufacturing activity were found at a number of other places in outer western and north-western suburbs of the Sydney metropolitan area. In addition, $134,000 was found when Reardon's home was searched, and radio scanners were found at the applicant's home. It is evident that the manufacturing activity detected on 8 January 2008 was far from being an isolated episode.

10The judge observed that ""this was a planned and organised operation""; ""the crimes represent a serious danger to the public""; ""the offender is central to these crimes""; ""the offender was an organiser of the operation""; ""he stood to gain financially from it""; ""there is no suggestion that the offender is an addict""; and he ""was driven by greed"". 

11The estimated street value of the methylamphetamine that could be extracted from the pseudoephedrine ranged from $500,000 to $2.7 million.

Sentencing of co-offenders

12Ashford DCJ sentenced McGreevy and Callager on 2 October 2009. They had each pleaded guilty to a single charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. McGreevy was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years. Callager was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years. Each received a combined discount of 50 per cent on account of their pleas of guilty and assistance to authorities, so the starting points for their sentences were 14 years and 12 years respectively.

13Reardon was sentenced by Toner DCJ on 13 August 2010, after he had sentenced the applicant. His Honour imposed a sentence of 15 years after allowing 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty; hence the starting point was 20 years.

14Reardon appealed to this Court with his sole ground raising a complaint concerned with parity in relation to the sentencing of each of his three co-offenders. It is evident from the extract from the judge's sentencing remarks provided in the judgment of Harrison J (Reardon v R [2012] NSWCCA 46 at [10]) that Toner DCJ found the culpability of each of Reardon and the applicant to have been indistinguishable and intended to adopt the same starting point for Reardon as he had for the applicant. Reardon's complaint of having a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentencing of his co-offenders failed. In relation to the present applicant, the reasoning is encapsulated in the following passage of the judgment:

[16] When his Honour sentenced the applicant he said that ""[t]he proper sentence for Count 1 is twenty years"". When his Honour earlier sentenced Mr Greenaway he said, ""[w]ithout any discount the sentence that I would have imposed would have been twenty years imprisonment on Count 1"". It remains unexplained why, in the light of the latter remarks, Mr Greenaway was not sentenced to an effective total sentence of 16 years instead of 15 years and 6 months. The so-called error therefore appears in the calculation of Mr Greenaway's sentence rather than in his Honour's application of principles of parity. That error would not in my opinion give rise in this case to a person in the position of the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance. On the contrary, it may well have theoretically tempted a Crown appeal in Mr Greenaway's case to adjust his sentence to take account of the ""error"".

Sentencing remarks

15Aside from incorporating the statement of facts and making the observations about them that I have referred to above, his Honour's sentencing remarks included the following.

16The precursor chemical, whilst found at a different location, was intended to be used at the same laboratory which was the subject of the manufacturing offence. For this reason, the sentences for the two offences would be ordered to be served concurrently.

17The applicant was aged 51. He had a criminal history that was regarded as insignificant. It was described as consisting mainly of traffic offences and some minor drug matters many years ago.

18Because there was a guilty plea the standard non-parole period for the manufacturing offence acted as a guidepost according to R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. In determining the effect of the standard non-parole period it was important to place the offence and the offender's participation in it within the range of objective seriousness of offences of its type.

19The objective seriousness in terms of the applicant's involvement in the manufacturing offence was ""at least in the middle of the range for offences of its type"". 

20Regard was had to the sentencing of McGreevy and Callager by Ashford J (whose sentencing remarks had been provided). His Honour observed that ""this man's role is significantly greater than either of these two"". 

21His Honour observed that ""the subjective case presented for [the applicant] is slim"". There were letters from the applicant's wife and from a prison chaplain. Various favourable aspects of the applicant's life were described. The judge said that he accepted most of what appeared in the wife's letter but added ""it is difficult to see, however, how it minimises or ameliorates the seriousness of his crimes and his part in them. On the material before me it is not apparent as to why he got involved or instigated and ran such a serious criminal operation"". 

22The judge accepted that the expression by the applicant of remorse to the prison chaplain was genuine. He also accepted that ""he will not re-offend given what will be his age on release and a belief that his remorse is a catalyst to his rehabilitation"". 

23The sentences were to be reduced by 20 per cent on account of the applicant's pleas of guilty as well as for ""other identified discounting factors"". It can only be presumed that the latter was a reference to mitigating factors found in the applicant's favour.

Ground The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period by:
(a) using the standard non-parole period as an effective starting point;
(b) engaging in an impugned two step process.

24Counsel for the applicant drew attention to the following passages from the judge's sentencing remarks:

It is important both for the purposes of determining the degree of influence of the standard non-parole period on the sentence and generally to determine where this crime sits in the hierarchy of offences of its type. 

Although this is a guilty plea, the standard non-parole period acts as a guidepost in sentencing, see R v Way. It is important in determining its effect to place this offence and the offender's participation in it within the range of seriousness of offences of its type objectively, as I have already noted. 

25It was submitted that, in accordance with the approach mandated in R v Way, the judge ""determined the impact of the standard non-parole period and penalty by singularly considering objective matters"". He found the offence to be in the mid-range of objective seriousness and identified a starting point for the sentence of 20 years. Without a finding of special circumstances, that would involve a non-parole period of 15 years, exactly corresponding with the standard non-parole period. It was only then that the judge reduced the sentence on account of the applicant's plea of guilty and other favourable subjective circumstances.

26Since the High Court of Australia in Muldrock overruled R v Way, the standard non-parole period, and the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence, take their place as ""legislative guideposts"" (Muldrock at [27]). What Muldrock proscribed was assigning to the standard non-parole period ""primary or determinative significance"" in the assessment of sentence and adopting a two-stage approach, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle of the range of objective seriousness and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period (Muldrock at [26] and [28]). 

27Assessment of the level of objective seriousness of an offence was not proscribed by Muldrock: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, per Johnson J at [45]-[47].

28The applicant's argument depends, in part, upon the coincidence of the selection by the judge of a starting point of 20 years which, ordinarily, would involve a non-parole period that is the equivalent of the standard non-parole period. It was contended that the coincidence is similar to that found in Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 at [35]-[36] per McCallum J.

29It may well be that the applicant is correct and that this does demonstrate that the judge adopted a two-stage approach to the sentencing task, correct at the time in accordance with R v Way but subsequently impugned in Muldrock. 

30An alternative view, however, is that his Honour adopted 20 years as the starting point, not because it equated to a non-parole period the equivalent of the standard, but because he considered that to be an appropriate measure of sentence having regard to the 14 and 12 year starting points adopted in the cases of the lesser co-offenders, McGreevy and Callager. The level of their respective involvement in the manufacturing enterprise compared to that of the applicant would be appropriately marked by the differential in the starting point adopted by Toner DCJ.

31But even if the judge adopted that approach, his approach was two-staged. He arrived at a sentence of 20 years without regard to subjective matters and then reduced it for the plea and other mitigating features. Such an approach is erroneous in itself: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74]- [76]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 375 [39]. 

Is a lesser sentence warranted?

32The written submissions for the applicant identified four cases that were said to support the proposition that a lesser sentence is warranted in this case. In oral submissions it was acknowledged that there was no ground of appeal asserting that the sentence for the manufacturing offence was manifestly excessive. But it was contended nonetheless that these cases supported such a proposition. 

33The standard non-parole period did not apply in any of the cases relied upon. In my view, comparing cases considered in the absence of a legislative guidepost of a significant standard non-parole period of 15 years is of little assistance. 

34In three of the cases, the standard non-parole period did not apply because the offence was committed prior to the introduction of the relevant legislative provision: R v Larsson (unreported, NSWCCA, 11 September 1997); R v Pedavoli [2002] NSWCCA 87; (2002) 128 A Crim R 137; and R v El Azzi [2004] NSWCCA 455. The fourth, and more recent, case, R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66, was factually dissimilar in that the offence was not part of an entrenched and well organised manufacturing enterprise, as the applicant's offence must be viewed, and the offender did not actually manufacture anything. The standard non-parole did not apply because the offence was one of conspiracy: Diesing v R [2007] NSWCCA 326 at [53]-[54] per Hoeben, Latham and Harrison JJ.

35None of these cases are of any assistance in comparing the sentence imposed upon the applicant with a ""range"" of comparable sentences. 

36The significant comparators in this case are the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders. Nothing more needs to be said about McGreevy and Callager. The details of the sentencing of Reardon have been earlier described. He was found to be at an identical level of culpability as the applicant and the force of his and the applicant's subjective cases were, on balance, indistinguishable: Reardon v R at [10].

37On the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant sought to dissuade the Court from having regard to the sentencing of the co-offenders on the basis that they were sentenced in the R v Way era and were therefore likely affected by Muldrock error. The problem, however, is that the sentencing remarks of Ashford DCJ in respect of McGreevy and Callager were before Toner DCJ and also before this Court. They do not disclose Muldrock error at all. Both of those offenders had pleaded guilty and so her Honour regarded the standard non-parole period as a guidepost and nothing more.

38The problem for the applicant's submission in relation to the sentencing of Reardon is that his appeal was heard by this Court after Muldrock was decided. He made no complaint of Muldrock error. The only complaint, one of parity, was rejected. His sentence, derived from the same starting point as the applicant's, stands for comparison.

39Two affidavits were read in the event that the Court moved to consider re-sentencing. They disclose that the applicant is performing well in gaol in terms of behaviour, employment and completion of a traineeship. He retains the support of his wife and numerous children. It is regrettable that his wife has endured a very significant health issue whilst he has been in custody. Unfortunately, such hardship is often associated with imprisonment. Whilst undoubtedly all of these matters are important to the applicant, they do not raise anything that would assist either way in the disposition of the appeal.

40Having regard to the significant seriousness of the offence and the sentences passed upon the co-offenders, I am driven to the conclusion that, despite any error of approach by the sentencing judge, no lesser sentence is warranted: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

2762678,Crawford v R [2013] NSWCCA 269,"Judgment

1GLEESON JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: John Crawford (""the applicant"") applies for leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Lismore by his Honour Judge Black QC (""the judge"") on 25 May 2011.

3The applicant pleaded guilty to offences of cultivating, by enhanced indoor means, a (large) commercial quantity of cannabis plants and of supplying cannabis. These are offences against ss 23(2)(a) and 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 

4The maximum penalties prescribed by ss 33(3)(b) and 32(1)(h) of that Act are, respectively, imprisonment for 20 years and for 10 years. (Substantial fines may also, or alternatively, be imposed.) A standard non-parole period of 10 years is prescribed for the cultivation offence: Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 

5The judge imposed a sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years 9 months for the cultivation offence and a concurrent 3 year fixed term of imprisonment for the supply offence. The sentences were specified to commence on 31 May 2010. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 28 February 2017.

6The proposed grounds of appeal contend that the judge erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period; failed to find special circumstances so as to impose a lesser non-parole period; and imposed a manifestly excessive sentence. The focus of the appeal is upon the cultivation offence; nothing was said in written or oral submissions by way of challenge to the sentence for the supply offence.

Facts

7Police executed a search warrant at the 70 acre property occupied by the applicant and his wife, Rhonda, at Tumbulgum on 31 May 2010. (Tumbulgum is in far northern New South Wales between Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads.) There was a large colourbond shed on that property. It was closed and locked. Ms Crawford was inside removing buds from cannabis plants. When the police entered the shed they found the entrance to a large underground area. It was accessible via a manhole and ladder.

8The underground area consisted of three rooms. One room was being used as a seedling and cutting raising area. A total of 204 cuttings were found growing in plastic containers on shelves. Only 35 of the cuttings had a visible root system, something necessary for them to be identified as cannabis plants. The containers had numerals written on them to record the various dates in the previous weeks in which the cuttings had been planted. Also in this room were 25 medium sized cannabis plants growing in a tray and some pots. Cuttings had been taken from them. 

9In a second room there were 91 cannabis seedlings growing in trays. In the third room, 168 mature cannabis plants were found growing in trays; some of which had been harvested.

10Artificial lighting, various ventilation and extraction fans, and a hydroponic watering system were being used to promote the growth of the cuttings and plants. Police were of the view that the hydroponic system was ""highly sophisticated"". A set of scales, large quantities of growing solutions, fertilisers and packets of resealable plastic bags were also found.

11The total number of plants seized was 319. The cuttings that did not qualify as cannabis plants because of their lack of a root system were excluded from the total.

12A total amount of 3.476 kilograms of cannabis leaf was also seized from both the underground area and the shed itself. This was the subject of the supply charge on the basis that the applicant was in possession of the cannabis for the purpose of supply.

13The applicant was arrested, charged, and remained in custody until he appeared for sentence. Ms Crawford was also charged and appeared for sentence alongside him. There is no parity complaint so there is no need to refer to her sentencing.

Personal circumstances of the applicant

14 The applicant was born in 1948 and so he was aged 61 at the time of the offence. 

15He had no previous convictions in this State but in Queensland he had been convicted and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for the cultivation of cannabis in 1991 in circumstances remarkably similar to the manner in which he was doing so at Tumbulgum. The sentencing remarks in that case were tendered before the judge in the present case. They indicate that he had purchased a rural property and set up an underground hydroponic system. He had become involved in that endeavour because of financial difficulties; he had become bankrupt following an economic recession which occurred some years earlier. There was material before the sentencing judge attesting to the applicant being a man of otherwise good character. There was a recommendation that he be considered for release on parole after serving 12 months.

16A Pre Sentence Report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service (""the report"") informed his Honour that the applicant had been happily married for 43 years. He and his wife had three adult children. His wife was experiencing some difficulties with her health. Very little else was provided as to his personal circumstances.

17The applicant told the author of the report that his motivation for offending was to provide financially for his immediate household until he qualified for the age pension. He appears to have been quite explicit in conceding that he was intent on financial gain alone.

18The only other matter of note in the report is that the applicant had been a co-operative inmate since going into custody following his arrest; he abided by routine, engaged in employment and was interested in pursuing studies.

The proceedings on sentence

19The applicant was represented in the District Court by a Queens Counsel very experienced and capable in criminal matters, Mr Rosser. 

20The applicant did not give evidence. The matters of significance that were the subject of Mr Rosser's submissions were that there were no statutory aggravating factors (which the judge accepted). The objective seriousness of the offence was ""no higher than the mid-range and probably a bit below that conceding if it was in thirds probably well within the second third"". The supply offence was consequential to the cultivation offence and so the sentences should be concurrent (which the judge accepted). 

21As to subjective matters relevant to sentence, it was conceded that ""there are precious few of those"". There had been an early plea of guilty (the judge accepted this and allowed for a reduction of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea). The applicant had co-operated in the application by the New South Wales Crime Commission for a forfeiture order which was relevant to his remorse (the judge accepted that there was remorse in any event by virtue of the plea of guilty). 

22Of significance to one of the grounds of appeal, there was no submission that the judge should find special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act so as to permit a reduction of the non-parole period to less than the usual 75 per cent of the head sentence.

Ground 1 The sentencing judge erred in the application of s 54B(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by:
(a) adopting a now impugned two-stage process of sentencing and using the standard non-parole period as a starting point.
(b) failing to give a full statement of reasons for the specification of a non-parole period lower than the standard.

A two-staged approach?

23The judge sentenced the applicant at a time when it was thought that the correct approach to sentencing for offences carrying a standard non-parole period was as described in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. The High Court of Australia overturned R v Way some four months after the applicant was sentenced: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""). The applicant contends that the judge's approach conformed to R v Way and was contrary to the correct approach described in Muldrock. 

24Muldrock held (at [26]) that it was ""a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance"" to what was thought in R v Way to be a requirement of s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to impose the standard non-parole period unless there were reasons for imposing a longer or shorter period. It was also held (at [28]) that nothing in Pt 4 Div 1A of that Act required or permitted a court to engage in a two-stage approach to sentencing for standard non-parole period offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle of the range of objective seriousness and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period. 

25The applicant's contentions turn on the following passages from the judge's sentencing remarks. After a review the facts of the applicant's offending, his Honour said:

Well those facts are sufficient, in my view, to set out the surrounding circumstances in order for me to explain my assessment, which I have to make because of the nature of count 1 against Mr Crawford, as to where in the degree of seriousness these facts come. 

26His Honour then considered whether there were any statutory aggravating factors present (s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) and found there were none. He continued:

I do not find any aggravating factors. That is all I do at the moment in connection with forming an assessment of where this comes in the range of criminality. I am quite satisfied it is properly described as midrange arguably it is above midrange but I am not going there, I leave it clearly in midrange. The degree of sophistication was significant, the quantities are significant, the planned rewards were significant, and I must say in reaching that conclusion I have been assisted by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the matter of Stock [2011] NSWCCA 49, a matter in which I was involved at first instance, I do not see much distinction balancing one thing against the other as far as count 1 is concerned. 

27His Honour then discussed the applicant's pleas of guilty and the question of remorse and then continued:

So as far as mitigating factors are concerned there is the plea to be approached in the way in which I have indicated and there is really nothing else to add under subs (3) [of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act], and those are the significant factors to be borne in mind when assessing the appropriate sentence for Mr Crawford. 

28His Honour referred to some matters pertaining to the sentencing of the applicant's wife before returning to the applicant:

Well having covered all those matters in the case of Mr Crawford, as I have said midrange, the non-parole period is of significance, had it not been for the plea in this case I would have regarded a sentence in the region of twelve years to be appropriate, and that is reduced to nine, and that, in my view, is consistent with the case of Stock. There is no basis upon which I can properly find any special circumstances. 

29His Honour then imposed the sentences referred to earlier in this judgment.

30It may be inferred from the first of these extracts from the sentencing remarks that the judge considered it necessary to make a determination of the level of objective seriousness of the cultivation offence because of the prescription for it of a standard non-parole period. That inference is supported by the fact that he made no such determination of the objective seriousness of the supply offence. There is nothing wrong with a judge making such a determination (as to which see below); but it is why he did so, and what followed, that is significant. 

31The second extract reveals the result of his Honour's determination, that the objective seriousness of the cultivation offence was ""midrange"".

32The third extract involved his Honour determining what mitigating factors were present. The sequence of his Honour's reasoning is indicative of him doing this in order to determine whether there was reason to impose something other than the standard non-parole period. He identified the plea of guilty and remorse.

33The final extract reveals his Honour's determination that, but for the plea, the sentence would have been one of 12 years. If that was the case, and there being no special circumstances, the non-parole period would have been 9 years. That is very close, but of course not identical to, the standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

34His Honour's statement that ""the non-parole period is of significance"" is significant of itself. This was obviously a reference to the standard non-parole period. The difference between the notional non-parole period under the 12 year starting point of 9 years and the standard of 10 years, is open to be explained on the basis of the mitigating value of the applicant's remorse.

35The Crown submitted that the judge simply made a finding as to the level of objective seriousness, something that has always been a conventional feature of the sentencing process and not rendered erroneous by Muldrock: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, per Johnson J at [45]-[47]. It was submitted that the process adopted by the judge did not involve him assigning ""determinative significance"" to the standard non-parole period. 

36While it is open to question whether the judge gave the standard non-parole period ""determinative significance"", I find the conclusion inescapable that his Honour regarded it as having ""primary significance"". Further, there are all the indications of his Honour having adopted the two-stage approach mandated by this Court in R v Way but found to be erroneous by the High Court in Muldrock. 

Adequacy of reasons

37The second aspect of this ground may be dealt with briefly. Counsel for the applicant contended that the judge did not give a full statement of reasons for the specification of a non-parole period either higher or lower than the standard so as to assist appellate review and consistency in sentencing for Div 1A offences: Muldrock at [30]. However, her paraphrase from that paragraph must be considered in the context of what the High Court said in the previous paragraph:

[29] A central purpose of Div 1A is to require sentencing judges to state fully the reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed. The reference in s 54B(4) to ""mak[ing] a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period"" is not to be understood as suggesting either the need to attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period, or the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending. It does require the judge to identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed. ...

38In this case, all of the ""facts, matters and circumstances"" which the judge considered were relevant to his determination of sentence were exposed in his sentencing remarks. There was no inadequacy of reasons in this regard.

Conclusion on Ground 1

39I would uphold Ground 1(a) but not 1(b). I will come to a consideration of whether a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed (s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)) in due course.

Ground 2 The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the question of the special circumstances

40It would have been open to the judge in the exercise of his sentencing discretion to set a non-parole period for the cultivation offence at less than three-quarters of the total term if he was satisfied that there were special circumstances: s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. But, as can be seen in the fourth extract from the sentencing remarks above, the judge considered there was no basis upon which he could ""properly find any special circumstances"". 

41It was conceded in written submissions that ""little had been put forward on behalf of the applicant in terms of mitigating circumstances as well as nothing put forward on the question of any finding of special circumstances"". It was also conceded that the judge was not even invited to make such a finding.

42It was submitted, however, that the judge ""did not have proper regard to the operation of special circumstances because there was no proper consideration of the mitigating factors some of which were available to enable a finding of special circumstances, e.g. the age of the applicant, motivation, remorse and the need for rehabilitation"". 

43Ignoring for the moment that the applicant's very experienced counsel did not consider it appropriate to invite the judge to consider finding special circumstances, the matters mentioned in the submissions in this Court did not mandate that such a finding be made. 

44The judge was clearly aware of the applicant's ""age""; not only did he refer to it (ROS 10) but the applicant was physically present in the court room. The applicant's ""motivation"" was irrelevant to the need for a longer parole period; indeed, the fact that he offended for reasons of greed was not a matter in his favour in any respect. ""Remorse"" was not ignored by the judge; he found in the applicant's favour on that subject. Finally, no attempt was made to explain in this Court (or the court below) why a longer parole period was required because of a ""need for rehabilitation"". 

45It must be borne in mind that the sentence imposed entails a potential parole period of 2 years and 3 months. No submission was made in either court as to why a longer period of parole was necessary and should have been provided.

46Ground 2 has no merit.

Ground 3 The sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive

47It is unnecessary to determine this ground as the same issues, and more, fall to be considered by the question posed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

Is a lesser sentence warranted?

48There was no challenge to the finding by the judge that the objective seriousness of the cultivation offence was ""midrange"".

49The applicant had very little in terms of subjective matters standing in his favour beyond his plea of guilty and remorse. His age, 62 at the time of sentencing and 65 now, is of some significance but not greatly so. The Pre Sentence Report recorded that he takes medication for arthritis but that this condition did not prevent him from engaging in employment.

50The applicant was not to be punished further for his prior offence. But personal deterrence is a significant consideration, given the prior offence was almost identical; the applicant had served a term of imprisonment; and he chose to replicate such offending solely for financial gain. General deterrence is also important.

51To be taken into account as well are the legislative guideposts of the maximum penalty of 20 years and the standard non-parole period of 10 years.

52Affidavits were read in the event the Court came to consider re-sentencing. The applicant experienced a ""coronary event"" in custody in June 2012. A medical report appears to suggest that the situation is not terribly serious, relatively speaking for a person of his age. His wife continues to experience various issues of ill-health. And his son, aged 41, was diagnosed a few months after the applicant was sentenced with a ""significant and disabling"" disease. He lives with the applicant's wife who cares for him. They live on the Gold Coast and find it difficult to travel to Kempsey where the applicant is being held in the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre.

53Upon consideration of all of this I am persuaded that the Court should allow the appeal and re-sentence the applicant for the cultivation offence. I would adopt a starting point of 10 years and reduce that by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Like the sentencing judge, I see no basis for finding special circumstances.

Orders

54I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal allowed.

3. Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court for the offence of cultivating, by enhanced indoor means, a commercial quantity of cannabis.

4. In lieu, sentence the applicant to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years and 7 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 11 months. The sentence is to date from 31 May 2010. The earliest day on which the applicant will become eligible to be released on parole is 31 December 2015.

2762680,R v Barnes [2013] NSWSC 1627,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: On 26 June 2013, Richard Barnes (the offender) pleaded not guilty to the charge that he on 12 October 2010 did murder Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez. The offender entered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Ruiz-Sanchez. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. 

2The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value the community places upon the preservation of human life is reflected by the need to have the conduct denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: R v Macdonald (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise, as in all offences of manslaughter, is that the life of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported). 

3During the proceedings on sentence, Mr P Leask appeared for the Crown and Mr W Brewer for the offender. 

4Samuel Lockett and Carl Brown have been found guilty by separate juries of the murder of the deceased. Bradley Owen Trawin-Hadfield and Kirk Daniel Tuivaga pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased which was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment charging them with murder. With no disrespect to these offenders, I will refer to them furthermore by their surnames during these sentencing remarks. 

5It has been necessary to deliver separate sentencing remarks for each offender because of the individual jury trials for Lockett and Brown and the differences in the agreed facts upon sentence for the other offenders. However, the parity principle is of importance when sentencing each of them and is not confined to sentences imposed upon co-offenders who have committed the same crime. It can also be applied to sentences imposed upon persons who are co-offenders by virtue of having been engaged in the same criminal enterprise, regardless of the charges that have been actually laid against them: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462; (2011) 86 ALJR 36 at [30]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [136]. However, the significant practical difficulties with this approach are well recognised: Jimmy at [203]; Green at [30]. 

6In my view, there is little utility in considering parity with Lockett and Brown who have been found guilty of murder. The roles that they played in the death of the deceased were much greater than the offenders who have pleaded guilty to manslaughter and there is a deal of difference between the maximum penalties for murder and for manslaughter. The question of parity is considered at [21] below. I have firmly borne in mind the principle of proportionality when sentencing all of the offenders: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 24; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15]. 

7The pleas to manslaughter were entered by the offender and Tuivaga on the same day. A document was tendered by the Crown without objection which sets out the basis of criminal liability for the offender and Tuivaga (ex A TB 1). 

Manslaughter as to Barnes and Tuivaga 

""1. There was in existence a joint criminal enterprise to assault Mr Ruiz-Sanchez,

2. The offenders were party to the agreement, and 

3. The accused (sic) participated in the joint criminal enterprise in that they physically assaulted Mr Ruiz-Sanchez, encouraged other parties to the joint enterprise to do so, and remained present throughout, being ready and willing to assist others if need be, and 

4. at a point in time before Samuel Lockett struck Mr Ruiz-Sanchez on the head with the gun, killing him, the offenders, knowing that other parties to the agreement intended assaulting Mr Ruiz-Sanchez, realised that Mr Ruiz-Sanchez was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 

5. The assault upon Mr Ruiz-Sanchez was unlawful and dangerous. 

6. The offenders did not foresee either death or grievous bodily harm as a possible consequence. 

7. The offenders did not foresee that another party to the agreement would employ the violence applied by Samuel Lockett, or it being achieved by use of a weapon.""

8Accordingly, the offender must be sentenced on the basis that he did not foresee the violence applied by Lockett or that death or grievous bodily harm was a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased. 

9A statement of agreed facts was tendered by consent (ex B). The agreed facts are: 

""On 12 October 2010, the offender Barnes was present with the offenders Brown, Tuivaga (both of whom he knew previously) and Trawin-Hadfield and Lockett (both of whom he did not previously know) at 51 Marlborough Street Smithfield.

The offender agreed to be the driver of a red BMW motor vehicle to convey himself and the other four offenders to Russell Street Mt Pritchard for the purpose of collecting prohibited drugs. During the journey, the vehicle stopped at premises in Welwyn Place, Canley Vale where a firearm was collected by the offenders.

After arriving at the offender Brown's sister's house, the offender became aware that Brown intended to confront the deceased, who lived next door at 42 Russell Street, Mount Pritchard, to discuss money owed to Brown. The offender, who did not know the deceased, was aware that Brown and the deceased ""did not get along"".

The five offenders left the house together. The offender knew that the firearm was taken by the group, and that a fight with the deceased was a possibility. The offender saw the firearm change hands between the other offenders as they approached the deceased's premises.

The offender stood in the front yard of the deceased's premises and saw a fight commence with the deceased. He saw Lockett punch the deceased in the face and place him in a headlock. He then observed Brown attack the deceased. Finally, he saw Lockett hit the deceased over the head with the firearm and saw that it discharged.

The offender agrees that he was party to a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and that he participated to the extent of remaining present throughout the attack upon the deceased, ready and willing to assist others if need be.

The offender did not foresee either death or grievous bodily harm as a possible consequence or that another party to the agreement would employ the violence applied by Lockett, or it being achieved by use of a weapon.""

10I make findings of fact in accordance with the agreed facts for the purpose of sentencing the offender. 

11The offender's conduct did not involve him physically assaulting the deceased. However, he had agreed with the four others to assault the deceased and it was for this reason that he entered into the front yard of the deceased's premises. He did not desist from participating in the agreement even though he was aware that a firearm was in the possession of his co-offenders. He was present during the cowardly attack upon the deceased and remained ready and willing to assist even though the deceased was outnumbered by his attackers. 

12Matters that mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence are that the agreement to assault the deceased was not entered into until shortly before he was attacked and the offender did not physically assault him. Furthermore he did not foresee that any of his co-offenders would employ the degree of violence used by Lockett or that death or grievous bodily harm was a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise. 

13The offender was born on 7 June 1983. He was 27 years old at the time of the offence and is now 30 years old. His prior criminal history reveals that on 20 March 2007, he was sentenced in the Newcastle District Court to imprisonment for 4 years commencing on 11 May 2006 and expiring on 10 May 2010 with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring on 10 May 2008 for an offence of aggravated break and enter whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. He was further sentenced for robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months commencing 11 May 2007 and concluding on 10 November 2011 with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring on 10 May 2009.

14Having regard to this criminal history, I give more weight to considerations of personal deterrence and the protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: R v McNaughton. I take into account the need for general deterrence. 

15At the time of the manslaughter, the offender was on parole for the offence of armed robbery. It is an aggravating factor that the offence was committed whilst the offender was subject to conditional liberty: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

16On 25 June 2013, Mr Brewer informed the court that he had been instructed to enter a plea to manslaughter. This was the day before the offender's trial for murder was listed to commence. On 26 June 2013, the offender and Tuivaga pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. Mr Brewer invited me to find that the utilitarian value of the plea entitled the offender to a discount of 15 per cent but I decline to do so as the plea was entered on the eve of his trial. Although this was a late plea, the estimated length of the trial was two to three weeks and involved issues arising from the principles of joint criminal enterprise. I assess the utilitarian value of the plea to be 12.5 per cent: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1. 

17The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. No reports or other evidence were adduced on his behalf but Mr Brewer made oral submissions. 

18Mr Brewer told me that the offender has three siblings, that his mother has been very unwell with cancer and the offender has an eight year-old child who is in the custody of his mother. The offender has attempted to re-establish a relationship with his son but his efforts have been unsuccessful whilst he has been in custody. The offender instructed Mr Brewer that upon his release, he intends to return to labouring and to live on the Central Coast where his mother and younger sister live. Mr Brewer said that the offender has no drug and alcohol issues, although that has been a problem for him in the past. I take into account the offender's personal circumstances. 

19Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. Many of the agreed facts came from the offender's ERISP interview with police. By his plea of guilty, the offender has accepted responsibility for the part that he played in the death of the deceased and his plea indicates contrition for the offence. His plea saved the Crown witnesses, particularly Ms Knaggs, from giving evidence in a third trial which reflects his remorse: Borkowski at [32]. I take into account his remorse as a mitigating factor. 

20Although he is remorseful and intends to return to labouring and to live on the Central Coast upon release, I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. The commission of the offence whilst on parole does not encourage an optimistic view being taken and the prospects of his rehabilitation remain uncertain. 

21I turn to the question of parity. Although the offender did not become physically involved in the attack upon the deceased and Tuivaga did, Tuivaga was not aware that a firearm was in the possession of his co-offenders, whereas the offender with that knowledge did not desist from participating in the agreement to assault the deceased and remained ready and willing to assist. I assess them as being equally culpable for the offence. I turn to their subjective cases. Tuivaga is about two years older than the offender but the offender's prior criminal offending is marginally more serious than Tuivaga's. Tuivaga, however, has been held in segregation whilst in custody and has an underlying depressive illness. It is likely that he will continue to serve his sentence under these conditions. The offender's custodial conditions are those of the general prison population and he does not have a mental condition. In my opinion, the hard conditions under which Tuivaga is to serve his sentence justify a lesser sentence than that to be imposed on the offender. Tuivaga was to be sentenced this morning but due to industrial restrictions at Goulburn Correctional Centre where Tuivaga is an inmate, he was unable to be brought to court today. I discuss the question of the offender's parity with Tuivaga at [25] of Tuivaga's sentencing remarks: R v Tuivaga [2013] NSWSC 1626. Tuivaga is now to be sentenced next Monday.

22Victim impact statements from Ms Knaggs, Maria Vinas, the deceased's mother, and Virginia Ruiz-Sanchez, his sister, were read to the court. The contents of these statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's partner and his family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

23The offender's sentence for armed robbery was not to expire until 10 November 2011 and at the time of his arrest on 17 November 2010, he was on parole for this offence. It appears from the offender's custodial history (ex A TB 8 p 1) that the offender completed this sentence on 6 December 2011 following his return to custody and not on 10 November 2011 as submitted by Mr Brewer. It is necessary to consider the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. The offence for which the offender was sentenced in the District Court and the offence of manslaughter are discrete and independent acts of criminality. This fact does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. 

24The offender's custody until 6 December 2011 was as a consequence of his breach of parole for armed robbery. I do not think that partial concurrency with that sentence would adequately reflect the criminality of the armed robbery or the offence of manslaughter. Accordingly, I consider it appropriate that the commencement date of the present sentence is 6 December 2011.

25Although Mr Brewer did not submit that a finding should be made of special circumstances, I find special circumstances as the present sentence has been made cumulative upon the existing sentence: R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; Close v R (1992) 31 NSWLR 743. I have determined that a non-parole period of 5 years is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].

26Taking into account all matters that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence is 8 years. The overall sentence is reduced by 12.5 per cent to 7 years. 

27Richard Barnes for the offence of manslaughter, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 6 December 2011 and expiring on 5 December 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 6 December 2016 and expiring on 5 December 2018. 

28The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 5 December 2016. 

29I ask Mr Brewer to advise the offender of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and of its application to the offence for which he has been sentenced.

2762681,R v Loveridge [2013] NSWSC 1638,"Judgment

1The offender, Kieran Loveridge, has pleaded guilty to an indictment containing five counts of offending, all of which occurred on 7th July 2012 at Kings Cross, part of the suburb of Potts Point. In ascending order of seriousness there are three charges of common assault, one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one charge of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.

2The offender is before the Court today to be sentenced for each of these offences, the proceedings on sentence having been heard before me on 25th October 2013.

3I will come soon to examine the facts in more detail, but each of his offences, in plain language, may be characterised as an incident of drunken violence in a public place. As the Crown Prosecutor put it, Mr Loveridge's offending consists of five unprovoked attacks carried out randomly on unsuspecting strangers by an intoxicated young offender. One of those attacks has had the most serious consequences. The offences taken together, as the Crown submits, constitute an overall episode ""of alcohol fuelled violence"" (23.44T), occurring over about one hour.

Victim impact statements

4I have had the benefit of having heard a number of victim impact statements in relation to the manslaughter offence. I should say that I have felt compelled by law to put the statements of the young man to whom Thomas Kelly was speaking on his mobile phone at the time he was attacked, and of the young woman who was then in his company, to one side. Despite being in contact with Thomas at the time of the offence, they are not victims of it, nor family victims within the legislation.

5I have, however, listened very carefully to the statements read by or on behalf of Thomas' immediate family, including his sister, maternal grandparents, and mother and father. From them I have formed the impression that Thomas must have been a wonderful young man full of promise for the future, and of whom his parents were justly proud.

6I could not help noticing that when the statements were read in court many of the large number present were moved to tears by the accounts given. I also noticed that this included persons I took to be in court to support the offender, including his mother. The offender himself wept. I am sure that every right thinking member of our community has a great of deal of sympathy for the Kelly family. I offer sincere condolences on behalf of the Court, and personally.

7I need to bear in mind that the punishment for homicide does not vary according to the personal qualities and characteristics of the victim. The law values all human life. However, ""the qualities of a particular victim ... serve as a useful reminder of the quality of human life itself, and of all that is involved in taking it away"" (R v McDonald (Unrep, 12/12/1995 NSWCCA). Even the friendless and unloved are entitled to the protection of the law, and to the laws denunciation of the conduct of persons who egregiously breach it by taking life. I remain very mindful of the grief and anguish suffered by the family (R v Dang [1999] NSWCCA 42 per Adams J at [25] - [26]). But I am not entitled to treat that consideration as a circumstance aggravating the offence.

8It also needs to be understood that I am constrained by law in the use that I may make of the victim impact statements. Serious crimes are committed against the community at large, and it is the community which is entitled to exact retribution. Whether a victim's family seek leniency or vengeance, I am not entitled to take their attitude as to the proper sentence into account as a fact, matter or circumstance informing the appropriate sentence (R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [30] per Dunford J).

Facts

9The facts relevant to the offending for the purpose of sentence have been agreed between the Crown and the offender (Exhibit A). I will summarise them for the purpose of these reasons. The offender started drinking at around 5pm after he and two associates purchased a carton of two-dozen mixed drinks, each can having the strength equivalent to 1.9 standard drinks. There is no agreement as to - nor any evidence from which I can find - precisely how much alcohol the offender drank, his blood alcohol concentration, or his actual state of intoxication at various times throughout the evening of 7th July 2012. However, the contents of the carton of mixed drinks had been consumed by him and two or three associates by about 7:30pm, when they arrived in the city by car. And by the time the group arrived at their first port of call, Darling Harbour, the offender was so affected by alcohol that he and one of his associates were yelling in the faces of passers-by.

10The group were denied entry to the first bar they went to. Another bar apparently was not so discerning. The group were admitted and consumed some alcohol in the form of mixed drinks, before catching a taxi to Kings Cross where they went to a bar in Darlinghurst Road shortly before 9pm. There is no agreement about whether the offender consumed more alcohol in this bar. He told Mr Peter Champion, a clinical psychologist by whom he was assessed for the purpose of the proceedings on sentence (Exhibit 1), that he drank some shots there. Counsel are in agreement that the estimate of the number of shots given by the offender to Mr Champion is unlikely to be accurate, because of the effects of his obvious intoxication on 7th July 2012 upon his recall. 

11Despite the lack of precision in the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that by 9:30pm on 7th July 2012, the offender was very drunk. I interpolate that drunkenness is not a mitigating circumstance, even in the case of a young man of eighteen years of age, as the offender was at the time of his offending. On the other hand, drunkenness may explain instances of criminal behaviour which the offender would not have committed sober.

12After leaving the Darlinghurst Road bar, the offender and his associates sought entry to another bar in Bayswater Road. He and one of his friends were refused entry. A witness saw the pair in the vicinity of that bar about fifteen minutes before the first offence was committed. From the agreed facts I am satisfied that at that time the offender was in an agitated state. One of his friends was attempting to calm him down by physical restraint. The offender, in company of another, then made his way along Victoria Street to its intersection with Darlinghurst road. A witness described him as drunk. The offender grabbed the shirtfronts of two acquaintances he happened upon in the street. He apologised to one of them and hugged him, from these acts I infer that the offender was disinhibited by his intoxication and was either unable or unwilling to control his aggressive urges.

13The first offence in time is the third count, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Marco Compagnoni. The victim was walking south along Victoria Road towards its intersection with Darlinghurst Road in the company of two friends. The victim noticed three males ahead who were loud and jostling with each other. The group included the offender and this may have been the incident I have just described. As he approached this group the victim fell behind his friends, I infer to give the jostlers a wide berth. Suddenly, without warning, and for no apparent reason, the offender elbowed the victim above his left eyebrow lacerating his skin and drawing blood. The victim kept walking and only noticed the injury a short time later. He received medical attention at St. Vincent's Hospital, but no stitches were required.

14Thomas Kelly and two female friends, also heading south on Victoria Street, were approaching the place where Marco Compagnoni was assaulted, within one minute of its occurrence. They had caught a taxi from Town Hall to Kings Cross with the intention of meeting friends at a hotel in Bayswater Road. Thomas Kelly was on his mobile phone talking to a friend who was already at the hotel. He had no reason to be on the lookout for trouble. He was entirely unsuspecting of any danger. On the basis of the agreed facts, I am satisfied that if he had noticed the offender at all, Thomas Kelly had no reason to suppose he would attack him.

15As Thomas Kelly and his friends passed by, the offender stepped out from the wall he was standing against and punched Thomas Kelly in the face with sufficient force to knock him down.

16The witnesses differ about how Thomas fell. One of his companions recalled him being turned by the force of the punch and falling face first onto the pavement. The other young woman saw him fall directly backwards landing flat on his back. It may not be strictly necessary for this difference to be resolved, but on the basis of the agreed medical facts, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the latter account is more accurate. A CT scan of Thomas Kelly's head showed a massive fracture of the back of the skull, more on the right side. It also showed brain injury in the left frontal area of the brain. At post mortem, laceration and haematoma were found on the right side of the back of the head overlying the basal skull fracture. The neuropathologist attributed this to a severe single blow to the back of the head, which I infer was caused by Thomas' head striking the pavement heavily. The injuries to the left front area of the brain were said to be consistent with a significant blow to the back of the head, giving rise to a contrecoup effect.

17Witnesses said the offender looked at Thomas Kelly as he lay on the ground. The offender appeared angry and intoxicated. He was then seen to run away towards the intersection of Victoria Street and Darlinghurst Road continuing onto the latter and on to Bayswater Road. I find that running away betrayed his consciousness of his guilt.

18As the medical evidence I have recounted shows, Thomas Kelly had suffered a very severe head and traumatic brain injury. He was taken by ambulance to St. Vincent's Hospital where emergency surgery was carried out, but the surgeons were unable to save his life. Clinical testing indicated likely brain death. Following surgery he remained in the Intensive Care Unit, intubated and ventilated until 9th July 2012. Given his catastrophic injury, Thomas' family were required to confront their worst fears and consent to the removal of life support. Thomas died at 7:59pm on 9th July 2012.

19Shortly after the attack on Thomas Kelly, the offender was outside the second Kings Cross club in Bayswater Road. He approached a person he had met before who went to greet him when the offender started swinging his elbows at the acquaintance's head, who pushed him away. When the offender recognised the acquaintance he hugged him and apologised but said, ""I swear I am going to bash someone tonight"". This statement, to my mind, supports the finding I have already made (at [12]) that by reason of his drunkenness, the offender was either unable or unwilling to control his aggressive urges. After this encounter, the offender wandered around the Kings Cross area until about 10:50pm, when he punched Matthew Serrao on the left side of his face. The victim felt pain and suffered some bruising. The attack was entirely unprovoked and the victim had been innocently walking along Roslyn Street toward Darlinghurst Road. After the assault, the victim remonstrated with the offender, demanding an apology. In response the offender swung another punch at the victim, missing him. A person in whose company he was pulled the offender away. Soon after, in Darlinghurst Road near its intersection with Roslyn Street, Rhyse Saliba accidentally bumped into the offender. He apologised immediately but the offender punched him in the face. One of the victim's companions, Aden Gazi, remonstrated with the offender, and he too was punched on the right side of his face for his trouble. Aden Gazi said, ""Really? That's your best? If you're going to hit me, at least knock me out"". I take this derision to be bravado on Mr Gazi's part.

20The exchange developed into a pushing and shoving match between the victims of these last two assaults, on one side, and the offender and his companions, on the other, which was broken up by two police constables on the beat. The officers observed that the offender was affected by alcohol and was agitated and emotional, waving his arms around and yelling. This conduct was interspersed with interludes of passivity extending to embracing the victim Rhyse Saliba. Being unaware of the previous incidents involving the offender, including the very serious attack on Thomas Kelly, the police officers contented themselves with separating the two groups of young males. As they did so they observed that the offender was again acting aggressively towards Rhyse Saliba. The officers requested and received the offender's details, and subsequently he was served with an infringement notice for a summary offence.

Aftermath of the offending

21The following day the offender was watching television with some of his associates when a news story was broadcast about Thomas Kelly's critical condition. The offender became quiet and looked worried. The offender said, ""Was that one of my fights, I don't know"". Over the subsequent days the offender made a number of similar comments to other persons. On 12th July he mentioned his concerns about being the perpetrator to the coach of his rugby league team. He said he was drunk, that he remembered being in a fight, but that he didn't know if he was the person who assaulted Thomas Kelly.

Arrest and legal developments

22The offender was arrested at 7:20pm on 18th July 2012 at the Belmore Sports Ground. He was taken to Campsie police station where he was charged. Originally the charges included a charge of murdering Thomas Kelly. 

23The service of the police brief was not substantially completed until 27th February 2013. On 11th March 2013, representations were made on behalf of the offender offering to plead guilty to manslaughter and the four assault charges if the charge of murder was withdrawn.

24Understandably, it took some time for the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider the representations and the defence offer to plead to the lesser offence of manslaughter. However, in the exercise of his discretion the Director issued instructions for the acceptance of the plea on 14th June 2013, and on 18th June 2013 the offender was committed for sentence by Central Local Court. He was arraigned in the Supreme Court on 6th September 2013, and on that occasion confirmed his guilty plea to all charges.

Prior offences

25The offender has a criminal record as a juvenile. His record is not very long or extensive, and with one exception to which I will return, there are no prior crimes of significant violence. However, it does extend to instances of taking and driving a car without the consent of the owner, damaging property, assaulting an officer and affray. These matters, taken together, lead me to infer that at least to some degree the offender has in the past exhibited an attitude of disregard for the law. He has not always responded to leniency and has required sentences of probation and control orders.

26Of significance is a previous conviction for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed on 28th January 2011. For various reasons, which I need not go into, the offender was not dealt with in respect of that matter by the Children's Court until 7th June 2012, one month before the current offending. That previous offence involved the offender gatecrashing a party. The victim was the young host of the party who was attempting to bring the party to an end at 11:45pm. The offender was intoxicated. He threw empty bottles at the victim and punched him in the face. When interviewed by police he made full admissions. He also ascertained the identity of the victim through facebook and left an apology on the victim's facebook page.

27As I have said, that matter was dealt with in the Children's Court on 7th June 2012, when the offender was released on eighteen months probation, which included the condition that he be of good behaviour.

28That the offender was at conditional liberty at the time of these offences is an aggravating factor of some significance.

29After his arrest for these offences, the offender was called up to be dealt with again by the Children's Court for the prior offence, which imposed a control order, in other words, imprisonment for a period of two months commencing on 18th July 2012, the date he was taken into custody after his arrest for these offences. I interpolate that I have accepted the submission of the Crown that to give weight to that sentence for previous offending, the sentences I pass on the offender today should commence after the expiration of the control order on 17th September 2012.



The circumstances of the offender

30The offender was born on 9th March 1994. He was nearly eighteen years and four months old at the date of his offending, and is now nineteen years and eight months. Both parents are of Aboriginal heritage. I bear that in mind only for the purpose of reminding myself that it may be a circumstance relevant to a degree of social disadvantage in the offender's upbringing.

31The offender's father was involved in criminal activities and his mother had separated from the father at the time of the offender's birth. The offender's father was in gaol during the offender's infancy. After his release, the offender's parents attempted to reconcile and during that time the offender's mother fell pregnant with his sister. However, his father abused drink and illicit drugs. He was occasionally violent and certainly abusive. On one occasion during the offender's childhood, his father struck him across the face with a bamboo cane as punishment for a trivial misdemeanour.

32The offender grew up in his mother's care and without the benefit of love, support and guidance from his father. He is apparently a talented junior rugby league player. He formed a close relationship with his football coach, and I infer from his mother's statement, that man may have been something of a father figure to the offender. Unfortunately he died of cancer, which the offender's mother states was very confronting for the offender.

33The offender completed primary school at Toongabbie without much trouble. His high school education has been fractured, partly due to an expulsion for his involvement in his juvenile criminal activities. He attempted to restart high school more than once, perhaps as part of the requirements of his probation, but it was difficult for him being older than the other students.

34When not in school he was able to obtain work with the help of family or friends. By late 2011 he seemed to be getting his life on track. He was continuing to play rugby league at a promising level, had completed year ten at school and was involved in a program which combined years eleven and twelve with vocational training. He had formed a relationship and was living in the home of his girlfriend, having been well accepted by her parents.

35Things have, of course, drastically changed because of his offending. He has lost the relationship, and the progress he seemed to be making in life has been, of necessity, completely derailed.

36I have had the benefit of reading the report of Mr Champion, the clinical psychologist (22nd August 2013 - Exhibit 1). I was impressed by Mr Champion's balanced, objective approach. He does not suggest that the offender is suffering from mental or emotional disorder, other than some depression and anxiety reactive to his offending, incarceration and the sentencing process. Nor is the offender intellectually disabled.

37Mr Champion assessed the offender as being of average intelligence at the lower end of the range. He described him as ""not the most sophisticated of thinkers"". There is no evidence that chronic alcohol or substance abuse is a feature of the offender's life, but the current offending, and the previous assault occasioning actual bodily harm, are associated with binge drinking. Mr Champion said (page 10[48] - Exhibit 1):

Mr. Kieran Loveridge is a 19 year old young man who is of basic average intelligence and is literate. He reports a difficult upbringing. He completed a year 10 course and was, he reports, pursuing higher education and training at the time of the present offences. He denied any chronic pattern of substance abuse, though problems appear to have arisen on a number of occasions (including the present offences) as a result of alcohol abuse. He does not appear to be mentally ill.

38Mr Champion considered that the offender may need psychological and psychiatric support to come to terms with the sentence imposed. He suggested that he required access to education and counselling programs of the type offered by the Corrective Services Commission for violent offenders, and those who have alcohol issues. It is pleasing to record that the offender has already commenced the getting SMART drug and alcohol program through his own initiative, and at his own request he has been referred for assessment for participation in the ""violent offenders program"".

39I have had the benefit of reading references from members of the community who know the offender and who generally speak well of him. Among those who have spoken up for him is the mother of his former girlfriend. She found him well mannered, polite and grateful for the assistance she provided him. She supports the account that at the time of the offending, the offender was in the process of turning his life around. Whilst he lived in her home he worked and always paid his board. She has witnessed his depression and anxiety in gaol.

40The offender has the support of responsible people at his football club, who also speak well of his family. Another member of the community speaks highly of the assistance that the offender has given in helping to care for her severely disabled eighteen year old son. The parents of a football and school friend speak well of the offender and his conduct in their home. They too confirm that the offender seemed to be on the right track before this offending. The mother of another friend supports the offender's account to Mr Champion that alcohol was not a feature of his lifestyle. From what she writes, I would infer that he is regarded as a good-natured person socially.

41The offender chose not to give evidence before me. Notwithstanding this, however, there is material before me which satisfies me that he is remorseful for his offending and particularly for taking the life of Thomas Kelly.

42Mr Champion made the following assessment (Exhibit 1 page 9[44]):

In relation to the issue of remorse... he expressed some insight into the offending behaviour and the impact of it on others (particularly Mr. Kelly and his family). He was able to articulate his remorse and it was pleasing to note that it was primarily directed towards the victims not he himself; given that many adolescents tend to initially express remorse on the basis of the impact that the charges have had on their own life and their family. He spoke of having lost many friends, his girlfriend, his education and employment as a result of his actions, but stated these as simple facts, rather than seeking special consideration.

43Ms Donna Shepherd, a counsellor with Corrective Services reported (affidavit C.E. O'Neil, 24th October 2013):

During [his] counselling session Kieran was open and communicative, he expressed deep remorse and regret and he appeared to have insight into his substance abuse behaviour. 

Kieran appeared to be deeply affected when he read the ""Victim Impact Statements"" and as a result he has been referred to a psychologist for support.

44The mother of his former girlfriend (Exhibit 3) said:

I have observed Kieran suffered depression and anxiety since he was incarcerated and I know in my heart if he could change things he would.

45As I have already pointed out the offender wept in court when Mr and Mrs Kelly read their Victim Impact Statements, which I took as a sincere expression of his remorse.

Some relevant legal principles

46In passing sentence I will bear in mind the principles I am about to discuss. The nature of the sentencing task is to fix the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender having regard to all relevant facts, matters and circumstances. An important principle is that the sentence must fit the offending, having regard to its objective seriousness; that is, the offender must be adequately punished for his offending. At the same time, a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the crime. 

47When, as here, an offender is being sentenced for more than one offence, the appropriate sentence must be fixed for each offence before consideration of the structure of the sentence, which includes questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality. It is important in this regard not to punish the offender twice for the same criminality: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 624. 

48The most serious crime for which the offender is to be sentenced is manslaughter, not murder. These are different crimes involving a different order of seriousness. It would be a grave error to mistake them. It is solely for the prosecution to decide what charges to bring. This is nothing to do with the Court. It is for the offender to decide how to plead. Again, this has nothing to do with the Court. The Court's only task is to sentence the offender for his offences to which he has pleaded guilty, and no other. 

49The crime of manslaughter to which the offender has pleaded guilty is the category known as manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The elements of this form of manslaughter are as follows:

(1)That the punching of the deceased was an act of the offender which caused the death of the deceased;
(2)That act was deliberate;
(3)That act was both unlawful and dangerous.

50An act is unlawful if it involves the deliberate application of force to another person without that person's consent.

51An act is dangerous if it is such that a reasonable person in the position of the offender ought to have realised that by that act the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. It is clear from this formulation that the question of dangerousness must be decided by the application of an objective test, namely, whether a reasonable person in the position of the offender, performing the very act which he performed, i.e. punching the deceased so as to knock him down, would have realised that he was exposing Thomas Kelly to an appreciable risk of serious injury. It is not sufficient to show that there was a risk of some harm resulting, although not serious harm. Moreover a reasonable person is sober.

52Unlike murder, in manslaughter the act of the offender need not be done with any particular intention to injure. The offence of manslaughter is complete even if the offender intended no injury and even if the offender had not actually realised that he was exposing the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury. As I have said, the question is an objective one of whether a reasonable person in the position of the offender would have realised that he was exposing the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury. As an intention to injure is not a necessary element of the offence, it follows that it would be no answer for the accused to say that the death of Thomas Kelly was unintended and unexpected by him. By his plea of guilty, the offender has admitted these essential elements of the offence. 

53I have set out the ingredients of this kind of manslaughter at some length so that one may appreciate the nature of the criminality involved. In the context of the facts as set out above, the ingredients of the four assaults I think speak for themselves. 

54The maximum penalty prescribed by parliament is an important guidepost to the intrinsic seriousness of a criminal offence. For the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly, the maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment. For the assault of Marco Compagnoni occasioning actual bodily harm, the maximum is five years imprisonment. And for each of the common assaults, two years imprisonment. It is important to bear in mind that the maximum penalty is reserved for the worst possible case of that type of offending. 

55As the offender pleaded guilty at an early stage he is entitled to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed for the so-called utilitarian value of his early plea. The Crown accepts that this is so and has fairly conceded that the degree of discount due is in the range of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. The offender is entitled to this discount in respect of each offence. 

56I am not entitled to sentence the offender to imprisonment unless I am persuaded that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. And where I impose a term of imprisonment of six months or less, I need to make a record of my reasons for doing so. This will be relevant in dealing with the assault offences. 

57A non-parole period when fixed is the minimum period of time that justice requires the offender to serve in prison. Unless I find special circumstances, the additional term during which the offender may be eligible for parol must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, in the absence of special circumstances. 

58Sentencing is not a purely logical exercise. Its purposes are various, overlapping and competing. They include protection of society, general and specific deterrence, retribution and denunciation, and reform and rehabilitation: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 164 CLR 465; s3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW).

Consideration

59As I have said I must fix the appropriate sentence for each offence. Where, as here, the offending occurred over the space of one hour within a confined location, involving a similar pattern of behaviour, there will be some common features, and I need to avoid double counting. Those common features include drunken conduct in a public place, the random nature of the attacks on unsuspecting passers-by, the consideration that the offender was on probation at the time, and his criminal record, including the past drunken assault. The fact that a series of crimes were committed demonstrates a pattern of disregard for the law which elevates the seriousness of the individual instances of offending. As I have already pointed out, the law always treats the breach of conditional liberty as a matter aggravating the seriousness of the offending; that these were drunken assaults in public brings into play the considerations of protection of society, the need for denunciation, retribution and general deterrence. All of these considerations are relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending. 

60I will deal with the offences in ascending order of seriousness. Dealing with each case of common assault, objectively there is little difference between them. Had one occurred in isolation, a different view of objective seriousness might have been formed, but for the reasons I have given I consider each one to be an offence of some seriousness. I would put the assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr Compagnoni at the same level of seriousness for that category of offence. 

61Assessing the seriousness of a manslaughter charge is always difficult. It is often said of manslaughter that it is a most protean offence, because it covers a wide spectrum of offending from a practical joke gone wrong to a crime falling just short of murder. It is that latter category which is likely to produce the worst case and the present offending, significant as its consequences were, does not fall into that worst case category. However, the elements I have already referred to, which the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly has in common with the lesser offending, puts the case into the category of some seriousness. It is not to the point either way that the offender did not intend to kill Thomas, or expect him to die.

62It needs to be borne in mind, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, that the attacks were on the whole spontaneous, in the sense of being unpremeditated, even if because of his drunkenness the offender was unable to control his aggression. That he may have in his drunken state decided to give vent to it does not detract significantly from this consideration. 

63It is obvious that for the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. I have reached the same conclusion in respect of each of the other offences. 

64As I have previously said, my task is to fix the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender, and it is relevant to bring to mind matters which may favour some degree of leniency. 

65First, there is the offender's guilty plea, and I have decided that the appropriate discount for each offence is 25 per cent of the sentence which would otherwise have been passed. 

66I am also persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the remorse the offender has shown is genuine and this augers well for his prospects of rehabilitation and reform, considerations in the case of a young offender which facilitate the protection of the community in the longer term upon his release. 

67The courts have an inclination to leniency in the case of a young offender. The purpose of this is to give the young offender a chance. However, other young people need to be able to walk our streets in safety. A breach of the peace of the type committed by the offender, notwithstanding his youth, calls for denunciation of his conduct, the exaction of retribution on behalf of the community and the deterrence of others who may put themselves in the same position. 

68To the considerations of remorse and prospects of rehabilitation to which I have referred, I would add that in my judgment the offender is very unlikely to re-offend. I have the very distinct impression that from the tragic consequences his offending has brought about, he has well and truly learnt his lesson. However, he will need to muster his fortitude and resolve to maintain that determination over what for him will seem a lengthy, and onerous, term of imprisonment. 

69Moreover, I have borne in mind the offender's relative social disadvantage and the difficulties of his upbringing. I have also taken into account the evidence of his efforts to overcome those disadvantages through education, training and employment. His offending has interrupted those efforts. For his own sake and in the interests of the community I hope he maintains those efforts so far as he can in prison and on his release. In this regard it is a good sign, and to his credit, that he has already initiated his participation in appropriate courses of rehabilitation. 

70I find that the combination of the offender's youth, remorse, prospects of rehabilitation and the need to structure sentences for multiple offences constitute special circumstances. In the end however, it is the preservation of the statutory ratio over multiple sentences that involve partial accumulation that will hold the most sway, and the amelioration of the statutory ratio in favour of the offender will for this reason necessarily be very minor. 

71For each of the offences of common assault, but for his plea, I would have imposed a sentence of about six months imprisonment. I have decided that I will round the sentence otherwise produced by strictly applying a 25 per cent discount, down to four months to avoid imbuing the process with an unreal air of precision. In due course I will impose a fixed term of four months imprisonment for each. 

72For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, I would have taken a sentence of twelve months imprisonment as my starting point. After the discount this would have been reduced to nine months. Having regard to my finding of special circumstances, I would have varied the statutory ratio to impose a non-parole period of six months. As he must spend longer in gaol for the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly, I have decided that the practical approach is to simply impose a fixed term of six months duration.

73I turn now to the most difficult part of my task, which is sentencing this offender for the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly. In approaching it I have borne in mind all of the considerations set out above. During the course of argument, counsel on each side of the record referred me to comparable decisions in the interests of promoting consistency of approach. I do not propose to deal with the cases in great detail. I bear in mind that what is required is consistency of principle, not numerical equivalence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520. The previous decisions establish a range of sentences actually imposed. They do not establish the correctness of that range: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [303]-[305]. 

74The various cases referred to were all put forward as examples of cases where a single blow knocked the victim to the ground and death was caused by the victim's head hitting the ground, rather than by the injury directly inflicted by the punch. Most involved a relatively young offender who pleaded guilty. In R v Castle [2012] NSWSC 1603 an offender aged 40 at the time of the offence pleaded guilty to manslaughter when he struck a woman with a single blow in the course of robbing her. To that extent, the case is not similar to the present case. After a 25 per cent discount for an early plea, a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months imprisonment was imposed, and a total sentence of 7 years and 6 months. In Donaczy v R [2010] NSWCCA 143, a 29 year old who had negative contact with his victim inside licensed premises struck him with a single blow outside the pub. The victim fell, striking his head on the ground. There was a 20 per cent discount for an early plea, and a finding of special circumstances. The non-parole period fixed was 3 years and 6 months, with a total sentence of 6 years. In R v Bashford [2007] NSWSC 1380, a 24 year old offender, who was at liberty conditionally, punched his victim outside a hotel. He received a 25 per cent discount for his plea, and a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months was fixed, with a total sentence of 5 years and 3 months.

75In R v Smith [2008] NSWSC 201, the offender was 22 years of age, he received a 25 per cent discount, a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, and a total sentence of 3 years and 9 months. In R v O'Hare [2003] NSWSC 652, a 22 year old offender who received a 20 per cent discount for his plea received a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, with a total term of 6 years. In R v Greenhalgh [2001] NSWCCA 437, a 37 year old offender of low intellectual ability received a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months with a total sentence of 6 years and 9 months. In R v Risteski [1999] NSWSC 1248, a 22 year old offender received a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a total sentence of 5 years. Finally, in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 a sixteen year old with a 25 per cent discount received a non-parole period of 4 years and a total sentence of 6 years.

76These cases, which both the Crown and the defence drew to my attention, suggest most commonly for broadly similar offending for relatively young offenders a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months is regarded as appropriate. A head sentence of between 5 and 6 years, depending on whether special circumstances are found, is commonly imposed. Occasionally higher or lesser sentences are imposed according to the particular circumstances of the case. I acknowledge that these cases provide some guidance. 

77Bearing in mind all of the facts, matters and circumstances to which I have referred and deriving some guidance from the similar cases the Crown and defence have drawn to my attention, but for the guilty plea I would have imposed a sentence of 8 years on the offender for the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly. This will be reduced to 6 years, and having regard to my finding of special circumstances I consider that the minimum time that justice requires the offender to serve for this offence is 4 years imprisonment. 

78I turn now to questions of cumulation, concurrency and totality. It seems to me important that the offender spend some time in prison solely referrable to each offence. After all, there are five offences having five victims, and the criminality involved in each cannot be equated. This suggests then that there must be some degree of at least partial accumulation. On the other hand, the total effective sentence should not be so large as to be crushing to a young offender, stifling his prospects of rehabilitation. This is in the community's interest, as well as his own. Therefore the approach that I have adopted is that a structure should be imposed which sees the offender spending some months in prison solely referrable to each of the common assaults, and the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The structure I have adopted means that the offender will not start his sentence for the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly until 18th November next. Effectively, the manslaughter sentence will be served consecutively with the other sentences of imprisonment (see s47(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).

Sentences imposed

79Kieran Loveridge, on your plea of guilty I convict you of each count in the indictment. I impose the following sentences:

(1)For the third count, the offence of assaulting Matthew Serrao, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months commencing on 18th September 2012 and expiring on 17th January 2013;

(2)For the fourth count, the offence of assaulting Rhyse Saliba, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months commencing on 18th November 2012 and expiring on 17th March 2013;

(3)For the fifth count, the offence of assaulting Aden Gazi, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months commencing on 18th March 2013 and expiring on 17th July 2013;

(4)For the second count, the offence of assaulting Marco Compagnoni occasioning him actual bodily harm, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 18th May 2013 and expiring on 17th November 2013;

(5)For the first count, the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 18th November 2013 and expiring on 17th November 2017, with an additional term of 2 years commencing on 18th November 2017 and expiring on 17th November 2019.

The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 18th November 2017.

80The total effective sentence therefore is one of 7 years and 2 months with an effective non-parole period of 5 years and 2 months.

2762682,R v FEW (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1771,"Judgment
1FULLERTON J:  JP died on 1 April 2011 from a head injury she sustained on 30 March 2011 whilst she was in the sole care of the accused at his home in Coffs Harbour.  The accused lived alone.  The child was aged 2½ at the time of her death.  The accused was not related to the child but had an established relationship with her as a de facto grandparent. 
2The head injury comprised a linear fracture at the base of the skull with associated bilateral subdural haemorrhages and brain swelling.  Bilateral multi-layered retinal hemorrhages were also identified. 
3On 1 August 2011, at the culmination of the police investigation into the child's death, the accused was charged with her murder.
4On 8 October 2013 the accused was arraigned before me and entered a plea of not guilty.  The trial was conducted without a jury in accordance with s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
5The trial commenced in Coffs Harbour where evidence was called from thirteen witnesses, inclusive of the child's mother (BJP), grandmother (RW) and great grandmother (LP).  These witnesses gave evidence of seeing the child in the days, weeks and months preceding her death while she was both in the sole care of her mother and, after her mother had placed the child in the care of the accused, in his sole care.  Paul Harmey, the ambulance officer who transported the child from the accused's home to Coffs Harbour Hospital on 30 March, and Dr Robertson, who treated her on admission before she was conveyed to Westmead Hospital that night where she later died, also gave evidence in Coffs Harbour.  They both noted bruising to the child's forehead unrelated to what later proved to be the fatal head injury.  Additional sites of bruising, both to the forehead and other areas of the child's body, were identified when the child was examined by Dr Norrie at the Children's Hospital at Westmead on 31 March 2011.  Save only for the bruising to the child's right ear, all areas of secondary bruising were confirmed on autopsy.  The autopsy also identified additional extensive bruising to the scalp, not associated with the skull fracture.  (These injuries were referred to at trial collectively as ""the secondary injuries"".)  
6The trial resumed in Sydney on 21 October 2013 where evidence was called by both the Crown and the accused from a number of expert witnesses in forensic medicine, paediatrics and biomechanical engineering.  
7The accused did not give evidence.  He relied upon two electronically recorded interviews with police in which he claimed that the child's head injury must have been sustained when she fell from her pram while he was in the toilet.  He also relied upon a walkthrough interview at his home where he reconstructed the scene of the accident.  He denied deliberately inflicting any of the secondary injuries or seeing anyone else injuring the child. 
The Crown case in summary
8In order to convict the accused of murder I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate act of the accused which caused the death of the child, and that the act was accompanied by an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm.  In this case, the Crown alleged that the fatal head injury was deliberately inflicted by the accused, and that the location of the skull fracture and the complex of associated head injuries are such that I would be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that at the time of the assault the accused intended to kill the child or to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
9The Crown is unable to appoint the precise mechanism which caused the fatal head injury.  The results of autopsy do not discriminate between the skull fracture being the result of a direct blow to the back of the head by the accused's fist or by an object wielded by him, or as a result of the child being thrown or deliberately dropped from some height, with the back of her head striking a hard surface and fracturing in the process.  In addition, the Crown cannot appoint the location in the accused's home where the child was fatally assaulted.  A crime scene search warrant executed on 31 March 2011 did not produce any relevant scientific evidence.  
10On the Crown case, the time at which the fatal injury was inflicted is able to be appointed with reasonable certainty.  At 10.01am the child was seen in the accused's care in a local chemist sitting upright in her pram and capable of responsive movement and, within a minute or so of 10.21am, she was seen by her mother and her mother's boyfriend in a severely compromised state of orientation and consciousness lying on the couch in the accused's living room after they arrived in response to the accused's telephone call claiming that there had been an accident.  The expert medical witnesses all agreed that whatever might have been the explanation for the child being observed by a pharmacy assistant to be sad and perhaps unwell in the chemist at 10.01am, she could not at that time have sustained the skull fracture, or any of the associated intracranial bleeding first revealed on the CT scan performed at Coffs Harbour Hospital following her admission two hours later.
11It was the Crown case that after returning from the chemist at about 10.10am the accused assaulted the child with sufficient force to fracture her skull and render her unconscious or semi-conscious.  It was also the Crown case that before he telephoned the child's mother at 10.21am the accused deliberately positioned the pram on its side, near the tiled foyer of his home unit, to give the pretence of the scene of an accident, and that he reconstructed that same scene in the course of a walkthrough with police conducted on 2 April 2011 for the same reason.  
12The Crown submitted that the postulated but unwitnessed fall from the pram was false and demonstrably so.  The Crown also submitted that the accused gave a deliberately false account to police of his movements on the morning of 30 March 2011 when he was first interviewed on 1 April 2011, an account which he repeated in the walkthrough on 2 April 2011 and in a further recorded interview on 3 April 2011.  According to the Crown, the falsity of that account was exemplified by the fact that the accused made no reference to leaving the house on the morning of 30 March to collect a prescription for anti-anxiety medication from the chemist, or that he had telephoned his doctor at 9.46am asking for the medication as a matter of urgency because, as he claimed to his doctor, ""Something terrible [had] happened"".  Instead, the accused consistently asserted in his various interviews with police that the morning of 30 March was a ""routine"" morning at home with the child until she fell from the pram.  The Crown submitted that the accused's lies were motivated by a consciousness of guilt, there being no other reasonable explanation for his failure to give a complete and honest account of his movements on the morning of 30 March in the course of what he knew was a police investigation into the child's death.  
13The Crown submitted that the accused's account of an accidental fall from the pram is not only inherently implausible but the time at which he claimed the accident occurred (namely, while the child's preferred television programs were screening - a claim repeatedly detailed and described by him to police) has been shown by the evidence led at trial to be objectively false.  The timetable of televised children's programs, variously nominated by the accused as being those the child was watching immediately before the fall, were all screened between 8.15am and 9.23am - before the child left the house with the accused to go to the chemist.  
14The Crown also relied upon the multiple sites of secondary bruising to various parts of the child's body in further support of the Crown case that the fatal head injury was not an accidental injury but an inflicted injury.  These secondary areas of bruising included extensive bruising to the scalp (revealed when the scalp was reflected at autopsy) with maximal involvement of large areas of the forehead anteriorly and the posterior aspect on the left side of the head; bilateral bruising to the ears; bruising to both buttocks (predominantly involving the left buttock with the grouping of the bruises resembling a handprint) and an area of bruising on the left thigh posteriorly (either incorporated as part of the handprint or a separate site of trauma) which, on dissection revealed bruising passing through the fat to the level of the musculature.  
15On the Crown case none of the secondary injuries were consistent with, or might reasonably be viewed as being consistent with, the postulated fall from the pram.  Viewed as a constellation of injuries, the Crown submitted that they could not be explained by any other accidental cause.  The Crown relied upon the evidence from the child's mother and her boyfriend (LB), and to a lesser extent the child's grandmother and great grandmother, to the effect that in the days preceding 30 March the child was not unwell and they saw no other bruises or signs of injury other than a bruise to her left temple from knocking into a hall table and a small bruise to her thigh.  It was the Crown case that the bruising to the child's ears; the extensive bruising to her forehead; the patterned bruising to her buttocks and the deep and diffuse bruising to her thigh were also deliberately inflicted by the accused, some of which may have been inflicted in the course of the fatal assault but all of which were inflicted some time after 5pm on 29 March when she was last seen by her mother and her mother's boyfriend in good health and spirits at the accused's home. 
The accused's case in summary   
16The accused denied deliberately harming the child in any way.  So far as the child's head injury was concerned, it was his case at trial, consistent with his account to police, that the child must have climbed, or attempted to climb into or onto her pram and, in the process, fallen backwards, striking the back of her head on the tiled floor in the front foyer of his home.  The accused told police that he did not see the fall but he heard a crashing sound while he was in the toilet and, upon rushing out, found the child lying on her back on the tiles.  He said he picked her up and carried her to the couch in a semi-conscious state and immediately telephoned her mother. 
17It was the accused's case, again consistent with what he told police, that the child had bruised her forehead in the left temple area when she ran into a small hall table some days before 30 March (an event he said was witnessed by the child's mother and which she confirmed in her evidence) and, on another occasion, that she had stumbled over or fallen upon some toys which may have explained the bruise on her thigh.  He said that there were areas of redness in her ears from insect bites.  He also told police that the child had left his home in the company of her mother and LB for two hours on the afternoon of 29 March and that when she returned she was quiet and seemed unwell.  He said he saw an area of redness on her right thigh when he changed her for bed that night.  
18In so far as the Crown relied upon the secondary injuries to reinforce the Crown case that the fatal injury was not accidental but inflicted, Ms Yehia, senior counsel for the accused, submitted that the Crown has not excluded the reasonable possibility that at least some of the secondary injuries were capable of being explained by accidental causes and, for that reason, I would discount those sites of injury as having any bearing on the issues at trial.  She also submitted that of the secondary injuries that were not readily or reasonably explained as the result of accident, (in particular the bilateral bruising to the ears and the deep patterned bruising to the buttocks) there remained a real and pervasive doubt as to the identity of the person or people who inflicted them.  In that connection, she submitted that I would reject as untrue aspects of the evidence of the child's mother and her boyfriend, in particular, their evidence that they did not have the child in their sole care and custody for some hours on the afternoon of 29 March as the accused claimed in his interview with police.  She submitted that the evidence of the child's mother generally lacked weight and that I would be left with concerns as to her credit.  Ms Yehia submitted that the delay of over an hour before the child's mother called the ambulance when, on any view, it was obvious that her daughter was seriously ill, coupled with a series of unexplained phone calls to her mother within that hour, is consistent with a desire on her part to conceal the child's inflicted injuries from the authorities, perhaps in the hope that the head injury, which she believed to have been the result of the fall, was not serious.
19Ms Yehia relied upon the proven tendency of the child's mother to inflict serious violence on her own invalid mother, as tending to prove her violent disposition when triggered by stressors of various kinds.  She also submitted that the personal circumstances of the child's mother in the weeks preceding the child's death (including leaving her in the care of the accused for three weeks in order to cement a relationship with a new boyfriend with a view to moving to Brisbane to live with him) raised a real doubt as to the identity of the person who inflicted the secondary injuries, thereby undermining the Crown case that it was the accused who inflicted the fatal injury.  
A summary of the competing submissions on the question whether a short distance fall can account for the fatal injury
20The Crown submitted the combined weight of the medical evidence as to the severity of the head injury, including the site of the skull fracture in the occiput, to the effect that it was unlikely to have been occasioned in a short distance fall; the identification of bilateral retinal haemorrhages; the design and dimension of the pram; the height of the child and the location of the pram relative to where the accused claimed to police he found the child on the tiles in the foyer, combine to exclude the reasonable possibility that the child died as the result of an accident.  
21Ultimately, the Crown submitted that with the reasonable possibility of accident discounted and, in the absence of any other reasonable hypothesis for the child having suffered the fatal injury consistent with the innocence of the accused, I would return a verdict of guilty.
22Ms Yehia submitted that not only was the postulated fall from the child's pram capable of producing a head injury of the kind revealed at post-mortem from a biomechanical perspective as attested to by Professor Pandy, but that each of the three expert medical witnesses called by the Crown, Drs Norrie, Duflou and Moran, conceded that it was possible that the fatal head injury was sustained in a short distance fall of the postulated kind, albeit that it was unlikely.  Ms Yehia acknowledged that a fatal head injury resulting from a child falling a short distance was reported in the literature as a rare occurrence.  She also acknowledged that the epidemiological studies referred to extensively in the literature, and drawn upon by each of the medical witnesses as contributing to the opinions they expressed that an accidental fall was a possible but unlikely cause of this child's death, was an approach reasonably open to them as experts in their field.  She submitted however, that after reviewing all the evidence (including the accused's account to police and his demonstrated love and affection for the child, as attested to by all members of the child's family), I would be compelled to the conclusion that an accidental fall of the kind postulated is a reasonably possible explanation for this child's death and one that the Crown cannot discount beyond reasonable doubt.  For that reason, she submitted I would return a verdict of not guilty.  
23Ms Yehia submitted that the accused's account of the incident, given for the first time within minutes of the child being injured, and maintained thereafter in the course of sustained questioning over many days, was coherent and consistent.  Save only for failing to account for his visit to the chemist in his account of the morning of 30 March, Ms Yehia submitted that there was nothing in the accused's demeanour in the face of police questioning or the answers he provided which gave any support to the Crown case.  In so far as concerned the lies relied upon by the Crown, Ms Yehia submitted that I would not be satisfied that the only explanation for his failing to tell police that he had called his doctor and had left the house to go to the chemist was because he knew he had killed the child and needed to conceal that fact, and that I could not rely upon that lie (or those lies) to infer guilt in those circumstances (see Edwards v R [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 at 201).
24Ms Yehia submitted that the Crown case, which timed the fatal assault at some time between approximately 10.10am and 10.21am (allowing about ten minutes for the accused to return to his home from the chemist), simply could not, in any rational way, account for the accused being seen at 10.01am in the chemist with the child and the relative normalcy of that encounter.  She submitted that it defies commonsense that the accused would have inflicted some non-fatal, but nonetheless serious injuries to the child that morning sufficient to raise his anxiety levels to the extent that he was prompted to call his doctor at 9.46am for an urgent issue of a prescription for anti-anxiety medication (the explanation advanced by the Crown for his call to the doctor), and then to have taken the injured child with him to the chemist to collect the medication, with the obvious risk of her vocally complaining that the accused had hit her and hurt her, or that her injuries would be noticed and the subject of remark or inquiry.  She also submitted that attaching the raincover to the pram (the evidence at trial being that the weather that morning was very cloudy with showers) was entirely consistent with the overwhelming weight of the otherwise uncontradicted evidence to the effect that the accused was a responsible and loving carer, and wholly inconsistent with him having assaulted the child before going to the chemist, sufficient to cause the secondary injuries, and then fatally assaulting her within minutes of his return.
25Ms Yehia further submitted that the Crown could point to nothing in what others observed of the accused's treatment of the child whilst she was in his care in the days immediately preceding 30 March, or on other occasions over the three weeks before that day, that might shed any light on what might have caused him to assault the child, inflicting multiple injuries to her head (one fatal), and to her torso and limbs in what the medical evidence suggested must have been at least two episodes of serious and unrestrained violence.  
26Ms Yehia submitted that the accused's demonstrated love and concern for the child was confirmed by the candid and recorded interactions with the child on his mobile phone which were exhibited at the trial.  This, she submitted, in itself raises a doubt as to whether the Crown has proved its case of murder.  She submitted that the Crown's description of the accused in final submissions as a man under financial, physical and emotional pressure, such as to render him capable of explosive and episodic violence on 30 March, was without any evidentiary foundation and was nothing more than a strained attempt by the Crown to explain the inexplicable and I would not be persuaded of the Crown's submission for that reason.  She submitted that when the accused's proven demeanour and behaviour is coupled with an accidental fall being a possible explanation for the fatal injury, the Crown has failed to discharge the onus of proving the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt and he should be acquitted. 
The issues raised by the evidence 
27The evidence led at trial over thirteen hearing days was detailed and in parts both complex and perturbing.  That said, a number of issues ultimately crystallised as critical to the question whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  They included the following:
(i)  Whether the Crown had discounted the reasonable possibility that the injuries which caused the death of the child were sustained accidentally?
(ii)  Whether, in considering that question, I am entitled to take into account any or all of the secondary areas of bruising revealed on pre-mortem and post-mortem examination and, if so, whether I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those injuries were deliberately inflicted, and deliberately inflicted by the accused, before they could support a finding that the fatal injury was inflicted?  In considering that question, what weight should I give to the tendency evidence led by the accused concerning the child's mother and, in addition, what is the impact, if any, of concerns more generally about the credibility of the child's mother and the child's grandmother?
(iii)  Further, in addition to, or as an alternative to the question whether I am satisfied that the accused was responsible for the infliction of the secondary injuries, whether I am entitled to take the accused's lies to police as evidence of a consciousness of his guilt of the crime charged in considering whether the Crown has discounted the reasonable possibility of accident as an explanation for the fatal injury? 
(iv)  If, having regard to the combined weight of all of the evidence legitimately able to be taken into account on the question of guilt, I am satisfied that the Crown has discounted the reasonable possibility of accident (either because the medical evidence renders that explanation so unlikely that it is discounted as a reasonable possibility, or even were the combined weight of the medical evidence such as to allow for an accidental cause as a possible explanation for the fatal head injury, the other evidence in the Crown case, and the inferences legitimately drawn from that evidence, compel the conclusion that the injury was deliberately inflicted), has the Crown discounted any other alternate hypothesis inconsistent with the guilt of the accused?  
(v)  In the event that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the child, has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was done with an intention to kill the child or inflict grievous bodily harm?  It was no part of the Crown case that the accused's intentional act was done with reckless indifference to human life?   
Family relationships
28The child's mother, BJP, was aged 17 at the time of the child's birth in September 2008.  She was at that time in a relationship with the child's father.  At the end of November 2010 she terminated that relationship.  The relationship was unstable and had been marred by abuse for some time.  There was, however, no evidence that the child was the victim of any physical abuse from either of her parents whilst they were together.
29In 2007 BJP's mother, RW, formed a relationship with the accused.  There was a time where she and the accused were engaged.  They remained friends after the engagement was broken.  RW said that when her granddaughter was born the accused occupied a significant role in the family and was spending a great deal of time with them.  
30RW gave evidence that BJP looked upon the accused as a stepfather figure as she had not known her biological father.  She said that when BJP ended her relationship with the child's father, it was a difficult time as she was divorced and BJP had no father figure.  RW said: ...she turned to [the accused] as a father figure because she needed that supportive protection. 
31BJP gave evidence that the accused was always there for her and that she looked up to him.  
32BJP stated that whilst her family (including her mother, grandmother and the accused) would help her with her daughter, she was the main caregiver.  She was not pressed as to how, and with what support she was able to maintain that level of care given the instability in her housing situation and the fact that by the end of 2010 she was effectively a single mother in her late teens, or how she dealt with the pressures and stresses inherent in being the sole parent of a toddler after surviving an abusive relationship with the child's father.  
33In early December 2010, on referral by RW, the child and her mother were accommodated at the Warrina Women and Children's Refuge at Coffs Harbour.  Whilst a resident at Warrina Refuge, at least until mid February 2011, the child attended the Caterpillar House Occasional Child Care Centre, also in Coffs Harbour, on eight occasions pursuant to an arrangement with Warrina Refuge.  
34BJP gave evidence that the child attended day care approximately three days a week, roughly from 9am until 3pm.  The evidence from Rosemary Franks, director of Caterpillar House, was that the child attended on the following three days in 2010: 8 December for 4 hours, 10 December for 7 hours, 15 December for 6.5 hours.  She attended on the following five days in 2011: 11 January for 6 hours and 4, 9, 16 and 18 February for 5 hours each day.  
35In early 2011 BJP met LB, the brother of her best friend, and commenced a relationship with him.  She said that her relationship with him developed quickly, and from the beginning of February 2011 to the end of March 2011 they spent most days together.  
36BJP gave evidence that her daughter had a good rapport with her new boyfriend, and that he was willing to take her on as his daughter.  In his evidence, LB said that the child ""had a smile that could light up your day"" and that he fell in love with her the first time he met her.  He said that his feelings towards the child were reciprocated.  
37According to the child's mother, because LB and her daughter were building a strong relationship and LB lived in Brisbane, she decided they should move to Brisbane.  She said because she wanted to see if Brisbane was a suitable environment for her daughter, she decided to go to Brisbane with LB and leave the child in the accused's care.  BJP and LB left for Brisbane on 2 March 2011 and did not return to Coffs Harbour until 21 March.
38BJP said that her daughter loved the accused as much as she did, and that the child would call him ""Poppy"", whilst the accused would call her ""Peanut"".  This was confirmed by RW in her evidence.  LB gave similar evidence and said that the accused was like a father to BJP, and that the child called the accused ""Poppy"".  LB also stated that when he observed interaction between the accused and the child he noticed that the child adored the accused, and the accused was very loving towards her.  Whilst the accused was considered to be part of the family and spent a substantial amount of time with them, he had not looked after the child overnight until 2 March 2011 when she was left in his sole care.  
39BJP gave evidence that because of her mother's disability (she had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for many years and was confined to a wheelchair), and because her mother was scheduled to have surgery in March 2011, the accused was the most suitable person to care for the child whilst she was in Brisbane.  RW confirmed that she was admitted to Coffs Harbour Hospital on 17 February 2011 for back pain, and then from 5 March to 15 March she was admitted to the Royal North Shore Hospital for surgery.  From 15 March to 23 March she was again admitted to Coffs Harbour Hospital.  
40During cross-examination, BJP confirmed that some time before she went to Brisbane she terminated the lease at Warrina Refuge and was living in between RW's residence and LB's father's residence.  She further confirmed that LB's father told her she could not stay there any more because the child's crying upset him.  She confirmed that after she returned from Brisbane the accused invited her to stay with him, however she decided to leave the child in his care and to stay with LB at her mother's home as ""it was easier for all involved"".  
The child's general health prior to being placed in the sole care of the accused on 2 March 2011
41The evidence from a number of medical and lay witnesses in Coffs Harbour was to the combined effect that the child was considered to be developmentally normal and in general good health, without any history to suggest she might bruise or fracture more easily than other children.  
Dr Bedford
42Dr Bedford is a medical practitioner with approximately 25 years experience.  He was one of the child's treating practitioners.  From his clinical notes, Dr Bedford confirmed that he saw the child on 27 April 2009, 31 August 2009, 13 October 2009 and 20 December 2010.  He gave the following evidence:The child always appeared to me...from my recollection, of just a pretty developing child and I had no reason or I would have reported the child if I'd had concerns if there'd been any signs of injury or anything that had sort of prompted alarm bells.  
43So far as is material to the issues at trial, on 20 December 2010 he said the child attended the Medical Centre with BJP presenting with a history suggestive of an upper respiratory chest infection of a viral origin.  He gave evidence that, ""the child looked well, ... basically was on a great weight for its age ... [and] appeared a happy, pretty little girl"".  Upon examination he recommended treatment for a viral infection.  He said that at the end of the consultation the child's mother told him that the child was ""veering off to the left"" and would ""run into walls"".  He considered that might be a feature of her chest infection.  He recommended that the child have a CT scan if the unsteadiness persisted.  He said, however, he was able to discern no neurological findings in the clinical setting to explain or confirm her unsteadiness.
44Other than members of the child's immediate family, the only other witnesses who gave evidence of the child's apparent health and well being prior to mid March 2011 were Ms Young, the manager of Warrina Women and Children's Refuge, and Ms Franks, the manager of Caterpillar House Occasional Child Care Centre.  
Ms Young
45As at February/March 2011 Charlotte Young was the manager of Warrina Refuge in Coffs Harbour and had worked in that facility for 21 years.  She held relevant tertiary qualifications.  She gave evidence that Warrina Refuge provided housing and counselling support for women and children in crisis, most frequently as a result of domestic violence. 
46As to their dealings with BJP and the child between 6 December 2010 and 28 March 2011, the records maintained by Warrina Refuge reflect the following: 
(a) BJP was referred to the service by RW on 6 December 2010 in circumstances where she had been the victim of abuse from her previous partner.  On admission, she was noted to be suffering from anxiety, stress and poor self-esteem.  Arrangements were made with Caterpillar House for the child to be accommodated on a ""needs basis"" as a respite for BJP when the demands of her young child were causing her stress.  
(b) Ms Young had the opportunity to observe BJP and the child between 6 December and 14 December 2010 as they were accommodated where the administration of the service was conducted.  Ms Young gave evidence that she saw and spoke with BJP over that period, albeit briefly.  She described her as an ""over-protective mother"" who frequently had the child restrained in her pram to enable BJP to attend to her rostered household chores.  Ms Young described the child as having good communication skills but that she was ""a quiet child"" who thrived on adult company.  She observed no signs of neglect, injury or anything else to suggest that the child was experiencing any emotional distress.  After BJP left the accommodation in Warrina Refuge and moved to supported accommodation in an outreach property, Ms Young saw her infrequently and did not see her with the child or speak with her at this time.  An outreach worker, Linda Parkinson, assumed supervision of mother and child at this time.  She did not give evidence. 
Ms Franks
47Rosemary Franks was the director of Caterpillar House, the Child Care Centre to which the child was referred under a funded arrangement with Warrina Refuge.  She described the child as engaging at her expected level with others and that her development was appropriate to her age.  There was no record of any injuries sustained by the child at Caterpillar House on the eight occasions she attended between 8 December 2010 and 18 February 2011, and no notation of any injuries the child presented with on arrival.  Ms Franks gave evidence that it was customary to check a child on arrival in order to identify any injuries sustained during the course of care which would then be reported to a parent when the child was collected at the end of the care period. 
Mr Hockings
48On 16 March 2011 Lachlan Hockings saw the child whilst he was installing a stereo unit in the accused's premises.  He described the child as: ...quiet, long hair ... probably the age of four or five, didn't really say a lot but, she just really sat there. 
49Mr Hockings said that the accused told him that he was looking after the child.  In cross-examination Mr Hockings confirmed that the accused had said to him, ""This little girl means the world to me"". 
The evidence bearing upon the welfare of the child between 2 March - 22 March 2011 whilst in the accused's care
50Prior to leaving for Brisbane on 2 March 2011, BJP said that she left money with the accused sufficient for food for two to three weeks, and that she told him of the child's daily routine, including meal times, nap times, and bathing.  She also left a cot, a pram, toys and videos.  She described the child's daily routine as waking up between 7 and 8.30am, being changed out of her pyjamas, eating breakfast, and then playing until lunch time.  Her lunch normally consisted of a sandwich and juice, and at times Milo.  On occasion, BJP said she would then take the child to the park.  She said the afternoon was a quiet time, when the child would be bathed and given dinner before watching a movie and being put to bed, which was normally between 7.30 and 8pm.  For dinner she would normally eat ""whatever the adults were eating"", which included vegetables, mashed potato and sausages.  
51On 2 March, BJP and LB travelled to Brisbane by bus.  During the journey, BJP and RW exchanged the following text messages.  BJP sent the following text: Well I'm on my way on my journey to Brisie.  A little bit nervous but excited.  Hope everything's okay.  Love you and miss you more than the sky. Xoxo.  
RW replied to this text saying:Don't stress, enjoy it angel.  It will be the last time you have a holiday on your own so please don't worry.  [JP] looked after by the best person other than me so stop worrying please for me and [JP] okay.  I love you more than words can say.  Love Mumma xoxo.  
52On 3 March, BJP sent $70 electronically to the accused.  On 10 March 2011, she received a text from the accused stating: [BJP] can you please send me $100 and I will pay you back when you get back.  I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it.  I get paid tomorrow but its not enough.  Love you dad and [JP] xoxo.  
53On 5 March, RW's mother (LP) was to meet RW at West High Street Radiology in Coffs Harbour where RW had an appointment.  LP arranged to meet the accused and the child there so that the child could give RW a gift before RW was transferred to the Royal North Shore Hospital for surgery.  
54On 11 March, LP had the child in her care for approximately two hours.  She said that the child was well but that the accused told her that the child had nappy rash.  She bought cream and applied it.  The next time LP saw the child was 16 March, when she again took the child to visit RW at Coffs Harbour Hospital.  She also said that she had changed the child's nappy and that the nappy rash had cleared.  She again confirmed that the child was well. 
55LP also saw the child on 23 March, when RW was discharged from hospital.  She said that the accused and the child were waiting on the verandah of RW's house.  She said that the child was excited to see her grandmother and also that she was ""really happy to see everyone"".  She said that the child was ""her normal toddler self"".  She said that the child and the accused stayed at RW's for approximately half an hour.  
56LP returned home on 24 March.  She did not return to Coffs Harbour until 30 March, when she visited the child in hospital.    
57Whilst in Brisbane, BJP said that she found accommodation for herself, LB and her daughter.  She described the premises as a large house where two other families were living.  She would have lived in the granny flat in the backyard, which included a bathroom, lounge room, bedroom and kitchen.  She said she believed it would be a safe environment for her daughter.  
58BJP confirmed that whilst in Brisbane the accused called her on a number of occasions and she would then speak to the child who she said sounded happy.  When she returned to Coffs Harbour, she said that the child's locution had improved, and her ability to form sentences had also improved.  She said that she believed the child was happy, had been well fed, and generally well looked after.  
59BJP did not see her daughter the night she arrived in Coffs Harbour.  LB did not return to Coffs Harbour with her but caught the next bus on the following day.  
60Photos and video recordings of the child taken on the accused's phone were tendered in the trial.  They depicted the child as responsive and well.  The photos were taken on 7 March 2011, and the video recordings were taken on 7, 10 and 27 March 2011 (the latter at RW's home).
The evidence bearing on the welfare of the child between 22 March - 28 March 2011 (following BJP's return from Brisbane)
61Whilst in Brisbane, BJP and LB decided they would move there permanently.  BJP said she told the accused about the move to Brisbane when she returned and that she was taking the child with her.  She said the accused was upset upon hearing this news, as was her mother.  She gave evidence that when they returned to Coffs Harbour she needed to organise her relocation, so she decided to leave the child in the care of the accused until they moved.  The move was scheduled for 30 March.  She said at this time she was living between RW's house and LB's mother's house having terminated her lease with Warrina Refuge, despite the accused offering to accommodate her and the child.  She said she refused that offer because she wanted LB with her.  RW resided around the corner from the accused.  
62During this period BJP gave evidence that she organised a trailer to collect her belongings from storage.  She said this took approximately a day and a half.  She said she also needed to get her car registered, and in order to do this it was necessary to replace the windscreen.  LB confirmed her evidence.  She also said she visited friends in light of her planned move interstate.  
63BJP gave evidence that she believed she took the child out to lunch or to the park with LB during the week following her return from Brisbane, however she was unsure on which days.  She said she saw the child every day, sometimes twice a day, and that she loved to say ""good morning and good night"" to the child.  She described the child as happy.
64RW said that nobody had been living in her house until she was discharged from hospital on 24 March, however she believed (but was not certain) that BJP was at her house when she was released from hospital and returned home.  
65RW confirmed that on 28 and 29 March BJP was staying with her.
Observations by various witnesses in the days before and the day she sustained the fatal injury
BJP's evidence 
66At the conclusion of her evidence in chief BJP said that when she bathed the child and changed her nappies from time to time after returning from Brisbane, she did not notice that the child had any unusual bruising (presumably to her buttocks, thighs or abdomen) although she did notice some nappy rash.  She said that she noticed a bruise on the back of the child's thigh (she was unable to remember which leg), the size of a 10 or 20 cent piece.  She noticed this bruise after she returned from Brisbane, but was not asked when she saw it. 
67On 28 March 2011, BJP's 20th birthday, she said that she visited the child at the accused's home for approximately one hour.  On this occasion she said she noticed a bruise on the left side of the child's forehead, above the eyebrow but below the hairline.  When she asked the accused about the bruise, she was told the child had hit her head on a table in his house.  She said she saw the child hit her head in the same spot on the same table whilst running down the hall.  She described that incident as follows: I asked [the accused] where [the bruise on the left of the child's forehead] came from and cause he had a table in the hallway of his house, it was a round table, stood about her head height, just in the hallway, she'd run and grab her jamas from the end room at the end of the hallway as she'd come towards the lounge room she had to pass it and she used to run like she was really good and every time she clipped her head on that table and I saw it myself your Honour.
She went on to say that the child was ""a good girl but she was hypo"".
68When asked what she meant by her description of the child as ""hyperactive"", BJP said that the child had a great deal of energy, in that she loved to dance and sing and jump off the lounge.  She said: ... I had seen her bump her head a couple of times.  She's getting to the point where she would jump up on the lounge and if you weren't quick she'd try and be Superman and fly off it but, yeah, gravity takes hold but he does have carpet in his house and everything.  She was just very unlucky to hit the tiles at the front door that day.
69She said that the table was not knocked over when the child's head hit it, and that she did not think to move the table to avoid another accident.  She said that the child said, ""I'm a toughie"" and ""bumped noggin"", but was not distressed and did not cry.  She described her daughter as ""a wild child"".  She confirmed during cross-examination that she was worried about the child as she was at the age where she was ""testing her limits"".  She said that the child was ""a toughie"" who would not be bothered if she fell over or bumped herself.  She agreed that the child was a handful, however denied that this was one of the reasons that she left the child in the care of the accused upon her return from Brisbane.  BJP said she also noticed a scratch on the child's forehead, ""I noticed the one big bruise and the little scratch on the other side"".  
70On the question of whether the child had been seen to climb onto the pram, Ms Yehia took her to her statement of 31 October 2012 which provides: Detective Howe has asked me whether I have seen [JP] climb onto the pram in any way.  I remember at least one time when she did climb onto the pram.  I can't remember whether it was at [the accused's] or at [LB's] mum's.  I never saw [JP] climb onto the pram and make it start to tip over.  Climbing on the pram is not normally something [JP] would do.  She would mostly do anything to get out of the pram.  I don't remember telling off [JP] for climbing onto the pram at [the accused's] place ever.  There was never a time that [the accused] needed to put the pram into [JP's] room because she was climbing onto it.  I don't think the pram would fit in there.  
71She maintained that she did not remember seeing the child fall off her pram, but said that the pram was normally parked near the front door.   
72BJP confirmed that she spoke to police on a number of occasions, and she was often asked by them about the relationship between the accused and the child.  
73In her interview on 2 April 2011, when asked about other areas of bruising on the child she said:...I know it's definitely there cause you guys, why would you lie to me, but I just - I don't understand how or why for the fact that I see them together and they are that happy and, you know, he'd protect her with his life.  He'd die for her and he's a mess at the moment.
74She also said to police:I just can't see him doing anything like this to her.  Like when I saw them playing it puts a smile on, they were so happy together...
75She was also asked by police about the abrasion on the right side of the child's head.  She responded: I'm not exactly sure where the gash on the right side of her head came from but it looked like a corner of a table or it could have been from the park.  
76Ms Yehia put to BJP that there was an occasion after her return from Brisbane where she ""smacked the child really hard"", and that the accused subsequently confronted her about it, which she denied.
77In October 2012, BJP was shown the pre-mortem photographs of the child by Detective Howe, and he asked her to mark the photographs which disclosed the injuries of which she was aware prior to the child sustaining the fatal injury on 30 March.  
78She confirmed that she had seen the bruise to the left side of the child's forehead and the scratch on the right (photograph 2648) which she said she saw on 28 March and which she believed occurred when the child hit her head on a table at the accused's residence.  However she did not circle the other marks on the child's forehead, which she said she noticed at the hospital.  She said that she was not responsible for the bruises and did not know how they occurred.  
79She said that she had not seen or done anything to cause the red mark in the child's right eye (photograph 2643), or the red area of discolouration behind the child's ears (photograph 2630).  Again she confirmed she did not cause these injuries.  
80She said that when she bathed the child she did not notice any injuries other than the bruises on the forehead and the back of the thigh.  In respect of photographs 2665 and 2666, which depict the child's thigh and buttocks area (both of which show significant bruising), she said that she had not seen these marks, did not cause them herself and did not know how they were caused.  She said the first time she had seen these bruises was in October 2012 when she was shown the photographs.  
81Photograph 2679, depicting a small coin-sized bruise on the back of one of the child's thighs, was circled by BJP.  She confirmed that she had noticed this bruise before 30 March and said that the accused told her that the child had fallen off the lounge.  
LB's evidence 
82LB gave evidence that he noticed a bruise on the child's forehead when he saw her at the accused's home on 29 March 2011, however he could not recall on which side of her head.  He said that the accused told him that the child had hit her head on a ""table or bench"".  He also said that he witnessed the child bump her head inside the accused's premises ""a few days before"".  He said that he did not see any other marks on the child.  
RW's evidence
83RW gave evidence that on 28 March 2011, when she returned home after being discharged from hospital after surgery, she noticed a bruise on the child's forehead.  She said she asked her daughter about it and was told that the child had bumped her head on the table or a piece of furniture.  Other than that she said that the child was in good spirits and was otherwise happy and healthy.  She said she believed the mark was on the left side of the child's forehead, but she could not be certain.  She did not notice any other marks, bruises or injuries on the child.  
Dr Robertson's evidence
84Dr Robertson is a medical practitioner in New South Wales and is currently employed as a practitioner at the Coffs Harbour Health Campus.  He has a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery and is an emergency medicine specialist.  He has been practising as an emergency medicine specialist for 16 years.  
85Dr Robertson noticed bruising across the top of the child's forehead near the hairline which was documented in his clinical notes, however he did not say and was not asked on which side of the forehead this bruising appeared.  He noticed bruising to other parts of the child's body which he did not document, but which he considered were in various stages of healing.  Following a brief external examination of the child's body on her admission he noted injuries that may have occurred at other times that were all of different ages but since he did not record their nature or location he was unable to give evidence about them.  
Paul Harmey's evidence
86Paul Harmey has been an ambulance paramedic for 26 years.  He noticed bruising on the left side of the child's forehead.  He was unable to say whether he noticed the bruising in the pre-mortem photographs just above the left eyebrow and the more substantial bruising located higher up on her forehead, or whether there was bruising in just one location.  He gave evidence that on the way to hospital he asked the child's mother about the bruising on the child's forehead and she had explained that the child's head was at a bad height with the kitchen bench, and that the child had bumped into that.  
29 March 2011
87BJP described her normal daily routine which she said she adhered to on 29 March.  She said this included going into town, visiting the accused and the child, seeing her friends, and visiting her mother and anyone else who needed help.  She said she received a text message from the accused on 29 March which read:[BJP] you forgot to give me my change from yesterday.  It's my food money love.  Love you.  Girl you're a woman now.  
88BJP said that she and LB visited the child at the accused's home, arriving at approximately 4pm and that she believed they both left at approximately 5pm.  She said that they were with the child (and the accused) out the front of the accused's home during the visit, which she described as follows: I think that was the day [LB] brought his guitar cause we were going to sing some songs and say hello to [the child] and stuff.  I think we sat out the front and had a couple of cigarettes and smelling the roses in the garden and everything and we were just singing songs with the guitar. 
89She said that they were together at the accused's home until she and LB returned to her mother's home where they stayed the night.  She said that neither she nor LB took the child away from the accused's home at any time that afternoon.  
90This was confirmed by LB in his evidence as follows:Q.  So can you remember the time of day, this is on 29 March, that you saw [JP]?A.  It was in the afternoon that I went over, some time in the afternoon.
Q.  Who did you go over with?A.  [BJP].
Q.  Did you take anything with you?A.  I think I may have had a guitar or something, I can't remember.
Q.  Were you playing guitar at that time?A.  Yes I was playing guitar at that point and I always used to take it everywhere with me.
Q.  An acoustic guitar?A.  Yeah an acoustic guitar, six string.
Q.  Did you sometimes play the guitar for [JP]?A.  Yeah she thought it was pretty cool.
Q.  Did you two sing songs together?A.  Yeah, well she tried to sing.
Q.  So you went over there this afternoon with [BJP].  [JP] was with [the accused] and you think you may have had your guitar?A.  Maybe.  I remember playing with her in the front yard, running around the front yard with her.  We were playing catch and it was pretty cool.
91LB gave evidence that the child was somewhat exhausted after playing catch.  When asked by the Crown if the child could talk he answered, ""A little bit but not overly great"", but said that the child did not complain of feeling any pain on that day.  He stated that the child was sad when he and BJP left and that she cried ""a little bit"".  
92LB stated that he noticed a bruise on the child's forehead that afternoon, however he could not recall on which side.  He said that the accused told him that the child had hit her head on a ""table or bench"".  He also said that he witnessed the child bump her head inside the accused's premises on another occasion.  He said that he did not see any other marks on the child.  
93He said he did not do anything to cause the bruising revealed on the photographs shown to him by the Crown, and that he did not know how the injuries were caused.  
94BJP said she did not bathe the child that afternoon and she believed that the child was not changed into her pyjamas when she was there, but she assumed she would have changed the child's nappy.  She said that she did not notice any injuries on the child other than the bruise on her forehead which she had seen previously.  She said that the child did not complain of feeling unwell or of being in pain.  She said the child did not have any difficulty running around the garden.  She said that the child was sad when she and LB left. 
95At the conclusion of her evidence in chief, BJP denied ever doing anything to physically harm her daughter and that she would ""protect her with [her] life"".  She also said that she had never seen the child climbing on the pram as the child did not like it.  Further, in the period of 27 March to 29 March she said she did not hit, punch or slap the child and during the same period had not left the child alone with LB.  
30 March 2011 - The day the child was fatally injured
Dr McClure's conversation with the accused at 9.46am
96Dr McClure practices at a medical centre in Coffs Harbour.  As at March 2011 he had been the accused's general practitioner for three and a half years.  The accused was assessed by him as being overweight and unfit.  A diagnosis of emphysema by a colleague was reviewed by Dr McClure but not confirmed.  He agreed, however, that it was a ""physical challenge"" for the accused to attend the medical centre.  As at March 2011, the accused was prescribed Antenex (a benzodiazepine, also prescribed as Valium) and Pristiq (an antidepressant) in 50mg doses which, in combination, addressed a diagnosed anxiety disorder.  
97Dr McClure gave evidence that there were two alternate procedures for the prescribing of medication to established patients.  One involved the patient attending upon a doctor in the consulting rooms, and the alternate procedure, where an established patient simply required a repeat prescription to be issued, involved the patient speaking to the doctor by telephone after which the prescription would be left for collection at reception.  The telephone attendance was not always noted in a patient's medical file, but it would be noted as a prescription issued on the computer file maintained at the medical centre.
98Dr McClure gave evidence of receiving a telephone call from the accused on the morning of 30 March 2011.  (Other evidence timed this call at 9.46am.)  He said the accused requested a repeat prescription for Antenex to be faxed through to a Soul Pattinson chemist in Coffs Harbour.  Although Dr McClure's notes do not record the terms of that telephone attendance, he gave evidence that the accused said something to the effect that, ""Something terrible has happened"".  He also gave evidence that despite breathlessness, agitation and some incoherence being features of his previous dealings with the accused when he was exhibiting symptoms of anxiety, on the morning of 30 March they were evident in a more exaggerated and acute form.  
99In cross-examination, he agreed that while he was not able to be certain that ""Something terrible has happened"" were the precise words that the accused used, it was words that were close to those words and that they conveyed to him the same meaning.  He agreed that in ordinary circumstances, without a note in his clinical records, he might not have recalled a patient making a comment of that kind, however in circumstances where, in a further telephone attendance with the accused on 4 April and a personal attendance on 15 April, he learnt of the child's death, the accused's earlier comment was fixed in his mind.  He also agreed that he had not volunteered to police that he had spoken with the accused on the morning of 30 March 2011 before making a statement to police in December 2012.  Whether he should have contacted police earlier and the reasons for his failure to do so were not explored in cross-examination or re-examination. 
100Under cross-examination, when it was put to him directly that the accused did not present any differently over the telephone on 30 March than in Dr McClure's other dealings with him as a patient and, in particular, he did not display any symptoms of acute anxiety, Dr McClure disagreed and maintained that in his estimation, the accused was ""more anxious that day"".  He also gave evidence that he had the impression that the accused may have been tearful, but over the telephone he could not be sure if he was crying. 
101He gave evidence that he would expect the Antenex (which was administered by the accused on a ""needs basis"" when anxiety to some degree was experienced) would take effect within 20 or 30 minutes and, after the medication took effect, that those symptoms would lessen, although they would be unlikely to resolve completely. 
Carmel Maione's dealings with the accused at 10.01am (when the Antenex was dispensed) and for some minutes before that time
102Carmel Maione has worked as a pharmacy assistant at Soul Pattinson chemist in Coffs Harbour for approximately seven years.  She said she saw the accused and served him on a regular basis.  She described his demeanour as quiet but friendly, and as someone who was willing to start a conversation and engage with her.
103Ms Maione described herself as a friendly person, enjoying making customers feel comfortable and accommodated.  She considered herself able to judge people's emotions having had experience dealing with a variety of emotional situations as a mother, grandmother and in the course of her employment.  Ms Maione gave evidence that she was often exposed to children in the course of her employment.
104On 30 March 2011, Ms Maione recalled serving the accused which, by reference to the tax invoice tendered in the trial, evidenced a cash transaction at 10.01am.  (It was not in issue that it was this transaction in which the accused was issued with the anti-anxiety medication prescribed by Dr McClure following the accused's telephone call at 9.46am.)  
105Ms Maione said she first saw the accused sitting in the consultation area of the chemist where he was waiting for his prescription to be filled.  She said he was with a little girl who was sitting upright in a pram which was beside him, with a raincover over her legs.  She said it was a drizzly and overcast day.  She said it was the first time she had seen the accused with a child.  She said that she could see the child's face clearly and that the child looked upset, with a slight quiver in her lips.  Ms Maione said that she tried to start a conversation with the child without success.  Ms Maione also gave evidence that she attempted to have a conversation with the accused about the child, which was also unsuccessful.  She said she thought that was unusual as the accused was usually a friendly and conversational person.  Ms Maione's words to the accused were, ""Oh you've got a little friend with you today"", to which he did not respond.  As the accused and the child left the chemist, Ms Maione said the child gave her a small wave and a half smile.  The accused did not say anything to Ms Maione as they left the chemist. 
106In cross-examination by Ms Yehia, Ms Maione confirmed that the accused and the child would have been in the chemist for a minimum period of fifteen minutes before the prescription was filled and paid for.  Ms Maione also confirmed that during the time that the accused and the child were in the chemist she was serving other customers, although it was not a particularly busy day due to the weather.  She said the child was not distressed or crying, but that she simply looked sad from her facial expression.  Ms Maione stated that the child looked at her when she waved. 
107I accept both Dr McClure's evidence and Ms Maione's evidence as accurate and reliable.
The call at 10.21am
108BJP said she was asleep at her mother's when she was awoken by a call on her mobile phone from the accused informing her that ""[JP] has had a stack"" and to ""come as quick as possible"".  (It was common to both the Crown case and the defence case that this call was made at 10.21am.)
109RW gave evidence that she was speaking to her father on the phone when she heard her daughter's phone ringing.  She said that BJP and LB then ""bolted out the door"", slamming it on the way out.  They did not say anything to her when they left.  
110After receiving the phone call from the accused, both BJP and LB gave evidence that they ran around the corner from RW's house to the accused's house.  BJP's evidence was:Q.  Who got there first of yourself and [LB]?A.  [LB] is faster than me plus he can jump over the front fence.
LB's evidence was:Q.  Do you remember that call?A.  Yes.  The next morning we got woken up to a phone call and [BJP] said that [JP] was hurt so we ran over to [the accused's] place.
...
Q.  Just tell us what you remember when you got to the front of [the accused's] place, what happened?A.  I jumped over the front fence, went inside and I seen [JP] on the lounge.
Q.  Were you told anything at that point in time by [the accused]?A.  As we've come in, [the accused] told us that she fell off the pram so I've gone over to [JP] and looked to see if there was any marks or anything and then I thought she had a concussion.  
LP's diary entry for 3 March 2011 but written by her on 8 March, was as follows:...[RW] said she was on the phone to her father when [BJP] and [LB] flew out the door.  [LB] lept over the railing out the front...
(There is a gate in the cyclone fence which opens onto a short path to an open verandah to the accused's unit.  The question why there was any need to jump over the fence and not open the gate and take the few steps to the front door was not explored in the evidence.)
111When they arrived, BJP said that the accused was standing at the open front door behind the screen door which was closed.  
112When she went inside, she noticed the pram was on its side and a speaker was tipped over next to the front door and that her daughter was lying on her back on the lounge.  She noticed LB was attending to the child (having entered first) and was attempting to get a response from her by blowing on her face and getting her eyes to follow his fingers.  LB said that the child was not responding despite his best attempts, and that her eyes ""were rolling and she wasn't in a real good way"".  LB said he was completely focussed on the child and therefore unaware of what the accused was doing.  He did recall that the accused told him that the child fell off the pram.  
113BJP described the positioning of the pram and the speaker in her evidence.  She said the pram was tipped on its side next to a cupboard by the front door, and the speaker was on the carpet lying in front of the door, pointing towards the pram and positioned very close to it, however she was unable to say if the speaker was face down.  BJP confirmed her description of the location of both items in accordance with the line drawing she provided to police on 31 October 2012.  LB also described the positioning of the pram and the speaker.  He said that the pram was on the carpet near the front door on its side with the back wheels positioned near the cupboard.  He also said he remembered there was a speaker on the ground, however he could not recall where it was.  (While at one time in the trial the positioning of the two items by BJP and LB relative to where the accused positioned them in the walkthrough appeared to be of some significance, in the result such discrepancies as might be thought to exist in their relative positioning did not assist me in resolving the question whether the Crown had excluded the possibility that the child fell from the pram.)
114BJP said that the accused was pacing around the lounge room.  She said that the accused had told her that he was in the toilet and had left the child to watch ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" when he heard ""a thud"" and found the child lying on the tiles with the pram on its side.  She said she understood that he came to the conclusion that the child had fallen off the front of her pram but that he did not see the fall.  She said that the accused repeated this account.  
115Both BJP and LB said they believed the child had a concussion and, for that reason, LB tried to keep the child awake. 
116BJP said the child was sweating, making strange noises, moving her limbs (feet) and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head.  She said that the child would focus on LB's fingers for a short period of time before losing focus again.  BJP believed the child to be slipping in and out of consciousness. 
The delay in calling the ambulance
117The ambulance was called by BJP at 11:31:51 and arrived whilst she was speaking to the 000 operator.  The recorded call was in evidence.  
118BJP said that she called the ambulance because she noticed the child's hand was ""in a claw"".  She said she was given a direct number for the hospital by the accused which she rang, however she was told to call 000, which she subsequently did.  BJP said that the ambulance arrived very shortly after it was called.  She said that when the ambulance arrived, the pram and the speaker had to be moved to allow access for the stretcher.  
119When asked why it was approximately an hour before the ambulance was called, BJP stated that she and LB were attempting to keep the child awake, and that she was in shock and as such was not thinking clearly.  In my assessment, despite the patent seriousness of her daughter's condition, BJP neither sounded anxious, agitated or even particularly worried in the course of speaking to the 000 operator.  For reasons I will expand upon later, I found BJP's demeanour as a witness generally unsettling and the contemporaneous record of her reaction to the realities of the situation in the 000 call difficult to interpret or understand (consistent with her evidence or the evidence of her mother).
120BJP said she did not remember whether she spoke to her mother whilst at the accused's premises, however RW said that she remembered calling BJP's mobile phone and speaking with her.  In cross-examination Ms Yehia took BJP to answers she gave to police when questioned on 2 April, where she said that she did not speak to her mother at all on the morning of 30 March and that they met later at the hospital.  Ms Yehia then showed BJP the index of telephone calls made on that morning (Exhibit N2), which BJP could not explain.  
121RW was shown Exhibit N2, a record of the five phone calls (items 4 to 8) made from her phone on 30 March to the accused's mobile phone.  After the phone call at 10.21am from the accused's phone to BJP's phone, the calls between RW's phone and the accused's phone are tabulated as follows:  410:46:080 seconds3 mins later510:49:1540 seconds3.5 mins later610:53:24387 seconds [6½ minutes]within seconds711:00:36384 seconds [6½ minutes]about 10 mins later811:15:370 seconds
The 000 call to Emergency Services was placed at 11:31:51.
122RW gave evidence that she only remembered, with certainty, speaking to BJP once before going to Coffs Harbour Hospital.  RW said BJP told her in that call that the child was ""limp"", that her eyes were rolling in the back of her head and her hands were clenched.  RW said that she told BJP to ""get off the phone now and ring the ambulance ASAP"".  (There are no telephone records which corroborate RW calling her daughter on her mobile phone.  There are however multiple calls to the accused's phone between 10.46am and 11.15am as tabulated above.  Although it was not put directly by either counsel, I proceed on the basis that BJP did not take her phone when she ran from the house, but used the accused's phone to speak with her mother.  She did use the accused's phone when she called the ambulance.)  
123RW said she had another conversation with her daughter, however she could not remember if that was when they were at the hospital, or whether it was on the phone that morning.  (She did not give evidence of what was said.)  She said she did not remember making the phone calls to the accused's phone recorded on Exhibit N2 (as set out above) nor did she remember speaking to him.  She said she remembered speaking to LB briefly over the phone and that he said that the child was on the lounge and was not responding.  She also said she asked BJP to hold the phone up to the child's ear to see whether she would respond to her voice.  When questioned she seemed to be uncertain as to whether any or all of these conversations were the subject of the two six-minute calls at 10.53am and 11.00am.  She could offer no coherent explanation for the calls or their content and no explanation for why there was a delay of over an hour before the ambulance was called given her evidence that she insisted that it be done as a matter of urgency because of her concern about the child.  She also confirmed she told police that she said to her daughter, ""Ring the ambulance now.  Youse haven't got time to muck around"".
124LB did not remember the ambulance being called but he thought the period of time from when he arrived at the accused's premises to when the ambulance was called was ""only five minutes"".  When the Crown asked him to explain what was in fact a delay of over an hour, he said that he ""didn't understand [the delay]"" and that he was focussed on the child and did not realise how much time had passed. 
At Coffs Harbour Hospital
125Only BJP went in the ambulance with the child.  LB, the accused, RW and LP met her at Coffs Harbour Hospital.  Only BJP travelled to Sydney with the child by air later that night.  LB, RW, LP and the child's father travelled to Sydney by road/rail.  The accused did not travel to Sydney.  
126RW said she spoke to the accused at the hospital about that morning, where she said he told her:...he actually placed [JP] on the lounge where she normally has her breakfast every morning with her show and watches at a certain time every morning, it was at a precise time and he goes to the toilet...and he heard a loud bang and a crash and he said he...bolted out and he said that Peanut had hit the tile - her head had hit the tiles and the pram was on top of her. (emphasis added)
127She was then asked by the Crown if the accused offered any explanation for the pram being on top of the child.  She said that the accused said: ... that [JP] must have played with it at some time from the day before to that morning and she must have unlocked the locks for some reason while he was on the toilet, she decided to get off while she was eating her breakfast, she put it to one side and she went to get on the pram to get into it and the front of the pram, the part that locks on, came off and she went back and hit her head and the pram ended up on top of her.  
128Later that morning, whilst still at the hospital, RW asked the accused to wheel her to see the child and he said, ""No I don't want to, I couldn't, I don't want to go down, I don't want to see her"".  She repeated her request and he obliged.  His reaction upon arrival at the hospital, according to RW, was that he cried and said ""poor Peanut"".  
129BJP said that at 20.41 on 30 March 2011 she received a text message from the accused stating:[BJP] if you can try put that money in early so I can do some food shopping.  How is my peanut going?  Try not to worry to much she is in good hands and Our Lord God is watching over our [JP] so have faith.  Love you very much my love Dad xoxo.
The accused's accounts to police
130In assessing the weight to be afforded the accused's accounts to police in the ERISPs, I am conscious that each is unsworn and not subject to being tested in cross-examination.  I proceed on the basis, however, that the interviews are a possible version of the events of 30 March (and the three weeks preceding it), and that they include an account of his relationship with the child, and the child's mother, which is entitled to some weight in the context of the issues raised at trial and the way the Crown had mounted its case.

131The accused was first spoken to formally by police at Coffs Harbour Police Station at 9pm on Friday 1 April 2011 in connection with what he was told was an inquiry into the child's physical injuries.  Apparently the police resolved to withhold from him that the child had died at 6.50pm that evening.  
132His account of what happened on 30 March was, in summary, as follows.  
133In accordance with their established morning ritual, which he said was adhered to ""religiously"", the child was given Weet-Bix for breakfast after which she watched cartoons.  He then washed out the breakfast bowl before going to the toilet.  Later in the interview he referred to going down to the chemist to get medication and also going to the park as part of his morning ritual but said he did not leave the house on 30 March.  Other evidence established that the accused was maintained on a methadone regime where he collected a 20 ml dose plus ""two takeaways"" on Mondays, a 20 ml dose on Thursdays, and a 20 ml dose plus ""two takeaways"" on Fridays.  He did not in this interview (or on any subsequent interview), inform police that he had called Dr McClure at 9.46am for the purposes of having a prescription for anti-anxiety medication available for issue to him as a matter of some urgency at the chemist that morning, or that he left his premises to collect it.   
134He then told police as follows: ...I'm on the toilet, I hear a bang, I bolted out, mate.  She's on the floor, I pick her up, I move the chair, the pram out the way, 'cause it's tipped over.  I picked up [JP], put her on the lounge, and straight away rang BJ.  And the ambulance, straight away.  So I can't say I saw the accident, cause I was on the toilet, mate, you know. 
135Shortly thereafter, in the course of repeating that account, he said when he came out and saw the pram he moved it and then ""pressed speaker down"".  He also confirmed that when he went to the toilet, the child was sitting on the lounge.  When asked how long he was in the toilet before he heard the thud, he said he did not know, ""...two minutes.  Minute, two minutes"".  He described the sound he heard, ""Like a door, door hit or something"".  He went on to describe the sound he heard as, ""Sort of like a steely plastic ... that's all I can say"".  Upon further description of the thud he said, ""...you know, like punching someone in the face"", and later as ""a sound you don't want to hear, OK.  It just sounded like a mad punch in the face, you know"".  
136He told police that the previous day when the child's mother was present, the child was playing with the pram and that it had tipped and rolled over.  He described the child being at the front of the pram playing with a doll trying to strap it up, and that she was swinging from the front bar and the pram lifted, and that BJP reprimanded her by saying, ""No, yuckies"".  He further described the child as, ""standing on the top bar and pulling the thing, tipping the pram up"".  He ventured the view that that was what happened to cause her to fall backwards on 30 March, and that she must have struck her head in the fall.  When asked whether he had seen the child climb on the pram on any other occasion, he said he had not but he said that he had noticed her stand on the pram and push it with her feet.  He went on to volunteer that when the child's mother was the primary carer, the child got ""really tied in"" (to the pram) because the mother ""made out she'd get into things"".  
137He was further pressed by police as to the location of the pram when he emerged from the toilet.  He repeated it was ""tipped on the side"", and that it was ""right smack in front of [the child]"".  He again repeated that he ""threw [the pram] out the way, pushed [his] speakers down"" in the process of picking up the child.  He said that when BJP arrived:...she seemed to be alright.  Like, she was breathing, she was doing fine.  And I'm saying, it's Poppy, it's Poppy.  And we got a smile out of her.  And then she just went different.  And then [BJP] said she must be chucking a fit...
138In so far as her eyes were concerned, he said they were rolling back in her head which ""spun [him] out ... she's two and a half, and when someone's eyes start, that's not good"".  
139When he was asked what he had reported to the child's mother over the telephone, he told police that he said, ""[BJP], can you get your bum over here, Peanut's stacked it"", and that he might have said, ""She don't look the best"".  He said by the time he hung up the telephone, BJP was at the front door. 
140He said that LB arrived with BJP and that they were attending to the child before the ambulance arrived.  He said there was a mix up in calling the ambulance and he believed that the hospital was called first.  He said the ambulance arrived 15 or 20 minutes later and that he met the ambulance officers at the front of his house.  He said he told the ambulance that he was in the toilet, heard a bash and came out (in effect, the same account he gave to police).  
141He went on to tell police that after being at the hospital, and after the child had been airlifted to Sydney, he came home.  He was at home when the crime scene officers attended at 11.50pm on 31 March to execute the crime scene warrant.  He said since his mother and sister had passed away his home ""hadn't been touched'.  He then volunteered, ""So if anything went wrong, it'll be there... But nothing [did]"".  
142He was asked how he got on with the child, to which he responded, ""Excellent.  Every time she saw him she would say, ""Poppy ... and give [him] a cuddle"".  He described her behaviour in the following terms: She was a good kid.  Like I said to [BJP], she's a top kid mate.  You know, like at school, she'd be the brainiest kid going, dead set.  Her mind just wants to learn and learn and learn, you know ... I taught her so much.  I taught her ... some manners.  Every time, you know, you give her something, you know, you say, thank you, say, you're welcome...  I was quite proud of her, what I done. 
143At this point in the interview he became visibly upset, saying that he just wanted to go and see the child.  He then went on to say that the child did not cry very much.  After he recovered his composure, and on his inquiring of police whether it was true that the child was not expected to live, police informed him that the child had died earlier that evening.  His outward display of grief gave every appearance of being genuine and that he was shocked at hearing of her death.  
144The police afforded the accused a 15-minute break after which the interview resumed with the accused's continued co-operation.  When police informed the accused that the child had a fractured skull, and when he was asked whether he knew how that might have occurred, he said: No mate.  The only thing I can think of is when she fell over.  It's the only thing I can think of. 
145In the latter part of the interview, when Detective Howe asked about the child's health, the accused said:...she wasn't cheeky, she wasn't, you know.  I've got to be honest, [BJP] ... gives her a hard time, she stresses her out, you know.  I feel like doing this, I feel like doing that.  And I think, she's just being a kid, you know.  And when she was with me, she was nothing like that...  
146He said that when he was with her in the park the child might stumble in play but she was able to get back on her feet without assistance.  He again asserted that BJP regarded the child as a ""toughie"" and did not need mollycoddling, but that he was softer than that.  
147In so far as the bruising on the left side of the child's forehead was concerned, he attributed that to the child bumping her head on the table.  He said the bruise was the size of a 20 cent piece.  As to what the police described as ""small haemorrhages"" to the ears, he claimed that the child had those before she came into his care and that he believed they were cockroach bites.  When police later informed him that the child had bruising to her inner ear, on both sides, and asked whether he had noticed that bruising he said ""No, no way"", and that when tying her hair back he did not notice any bruises.  (The child's hair was tied off her face in a video from the accused's phone dated 10 March 2011, which were exhibited in the trial.)  
148When asked about the bruises to the back of the child's thigh and buttocks, he said:She's got a little toy Roary the Racing Car ... she did have a little fall.  But there wasn't a bruise then ... it might've come out afterwards ... And I told [BJP] that too... but there was no bruise there then.  
149He went on to say that he did not notice any bruises on the back of her thigh or on her buttocks at all.  He said that the fall involving the toy racing car was in the context of stumbling over a pile of toys.  When asked when that had happened, he said it might have been ""Saturday or Friday, something like that"" (that is, 25 or 26 March 2011).  He said that the child just ""plonked down"" onto the toy because he heard the recorded voice in the toy say, ""Come on Roary, Go Roary"", which happens when the helmet of the toy is hit.  He again volunteered that the child was ""the happiest kid you'd meet"" and broke down into tears.   
ERISP 2
150On Sunday 3 April 2011, after a recorded walkthrough interview at the accused's home the previous day in which he reconstructed the ""accident scene"", a further interview was convened at the Coffs Harbour Police Station.  As with the previous two police interviews, the accused was cautioned.  It was also made clear to him in this interview, as with the previous two interviews, that he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time. 
151At the commencement of the interview, the accused provided police with his mobile telephone which contained pictures of the child together with video recordings of her dated 7 March 2011, tendered in the trial.  
152Early in the interview, police confirmed that in an unrecorded conversation with the accused that morning, he had informed them that the day before the accident (that is 29 March), the child had left his home with BJP and LB, information which had not been included in the interview on 1 April 2011. 
153He gave the following account. They just come out and just said they were going for a walk down the shop.  That was it.  And then her and [LB] walked down towards Woolworths way...you know as you leave my front gate?  The right way, and then the last I saw of them when they got back and then when they got back I said [the child] had brekkie, ah I mean dinner, and then I put her to bed, yeah.  
154He was then asked to give an account of his movements on 29 March, which he did by generally recounting the morning routine after the child woke him by calling out, namely, changing her soiled nappy, and putting her on the lounge to watch cartoons.  As to her viewing of the cartoons, he said:...it's a ritual.  She loves her cartoons.  Her favourite cartoon is Thomas, she likes Thomas the Tank, Playschool, Roary Racing Car and AB, you know that ABC thing.  
155He went on to say that after the morning ritual they played out the front of his home with a ball.  He said, ""She didn't have any falls or nothing there.  It was perfect"".  When asked what happened after that he said, ""She probably would have had lunch, and then I think [BJP] came around"".  When asked to tell police more about that visit he said that BJP and LB said, ""Do you want to go for a walk down the shop? ... and then they walked down the street"".  When asked whether anything was said as to why they were going down the street he said, ""Well [LB] reckons he was missing her and all that, wanted to spend some time with her"".  He said that the child's mother and her boyfriend arrived unannounced.  He went onto say ""[BJP] used to pop in and out like a fly"" and that although she did not visit every day, she came most days.  
156Later in the interview he was pressed by police to detail the circumstances in which the child left with her mother and LB on the afternoon of 29 March.  He said they left with the child in the pram, and that the child said, ""See you later Poppy"" and they turned right onto West High Street.  He said he went inside to play a video game.  He could not provide a precise time as to when they returned but said they were away for a ""couple of hours"".  When asked an open question as to what happened when they returned, he gave a detailed answer in the following terms: [She] seemed all right.  Bugalugs was in her pram, you know, like.  For some reason, [BJP] don't like her out of the pram, you know.  And I don't believe kids should be restrained, you know.  When I first got Peanut, when you got her out of, like she's been in a pram that often, her legs were weak, you know, through being in the pram so often.  So when I'd take her for a walk, I'd usually take her by the hand, strengthen up her legs a bit.  And then she wasn't as, you know, bumble footed.  And Sandy'll tell you the exact same thing, you know...  
157When asked again by interviewing police how the child was when she returned on 29 March, he said:I gotta be honest, she wasn't her normal self.  She's normally more active and stuff, you know, because she likes to sit on my lap too.  A lot of times she'll be sittin' on the lounge, and then all of a sudden she'll run over and sit on my lap, you know...And normally she, like I said, she's like happy go lucky kid mate.  But she wasn't that happy.  And I just put it down to missin' Mum, you know.  That's exactly what I put it down to but...she just wasn't herself...She just seemed sad, or you know she just, just, I don't know.  Like I said, maybe because Mum went...They went and she just wasn't herself you know.  
158He said that after BJP left, he and the child watched ""The Simpsons"" after which she was put to bed.  He said that the child was talking and walking and she looked alright but felt ""a bit warm"".  He said that he noticed her hair was wet on the sides and she appeared to have been ""perspiring...she was really hot"".  He said that she did not complain of feeling unwell.  He said that he always asked her whether she was okay and when she said ""I'm okay"" he accepted that because, ""... a kid feeling sick at the age she is, she would tell you, you know.  Cos she was two and a half"".  
159He said that he did not notice anything different or unusual about the child before she was put to bed other than when he changed her nappy, when he noticed ""a little mark on her bum"".  When he was asked to tell the police more about the mark he said: Just looked like somethin' like, I don't know, she fell over, you know.  'Cause I spose if it was a smack, you'd see a hand mark or, I'd imagine, you know. 
160At this point in the interview he referred to the vicinity of the top of the child's thigh, on the right side, approximating the size of a packet of cigarettes.  In describing its shape and size he said:...it was sort of like she's been sittin' on somethin'.  Like, you know when you get a pressure point...like a sunburn type colour. 
161He said when changing the child into her pyjamas that evening he did not notice anything else, apart from her being:...quietish...like she wasn't herself...and I just put that down as if she, you know, missed mum, you know.  'Cause her dad and mum have split up and she has got a new bloke... 
162He said he did not believe that he had bathed the child that day or that night but she might have been bathed the day before by BJP.  
163He also went on to say that when BJP and LB returned with the child he asked her whether she wanted to watch ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" on a DVD, and that she went into her room and got it by herself.  He said LB left, and that he and BJP had a smoke either in the dining room or outside.  When he was asked by interviewing police what the child was doing whilst they were talking he said:Well she was watchin' telly and she did go to come in the lounge room.  And [BJP] said, No, back on the lounge.  And she bolted back in the lounge room...
164He said that before BJP even went away to Brisbane, if anyone went near the child she would flinch as if she was going to be hit, and that he had raised this with the child's grandmother.  (RW was not questioned about this in her evidence.)
165Towards the end of the interview, police invited the accused to give an account of what happened on 30 March ""from the moment he woke up"".  He again recounted, in summary, his routine without making any reference to ringing his doctor for an urgent prescription for anti-anxiety medication or leaving the house to collect it.  He gave an account which suggested that the child was apparently well, in the sense that she was not upset or distressed.  He recounted his loving affection for her and her reciprocal affection for him.  When referring to the television program the child was watching before he went to the toilet he said: ...I can even tell you what was on telly.  it was...Roary...And oh...There's another show on before Roary.  It was... she watches the show before Roary, then Roary, and then she watches Playschool...
166When asked what television station she was watching on 30 March he said, ""I don't know, we usually watch ABC or 7 as that's where the cartoons are on"".  When pressed he claimed that he heard the ""Roary the Racing Car"" cartoon program and then he heard the bang.  He said: ...And honestly I thought it was my speaker, to be the truth, you know.  But when I come boltin' out, I, spun me out mate.  Like my sister's trying to say she, you know, is there a chance she could have had an epileptic fit?  I said, I did not even know she was epileptic until [BJP] told me that day.  Because if I knew she was epileptic, I wouldn't have took'n that kid on, mate.  Because she had no real medicine, no nothin' with her.  And if I knew she was epileptic, there's no way I'd, mate, I wouldn't be here now, put it that way. 
167He was asked how long after BJP and LB arrived was an ambulance called to which he responded, ""I've still got it on my phone"".  He was asked without looking at his phone whether he could say how long before the ambulance was called to which he said: ...Well I told [BJP], I said, There's my phone, ring the fuckin' ambulance... and then she rang the ambulance...It'd be a couple of minutes mate.  But wouldn't be no more than 10.  So.  But like I said, if it was my baby, the ambulance would've been called straight away, you know.  
168When asked why he did not call the ambulance he said:Well like I said, I didn't know what the fuck was goin' on, mate, you know.  That's why I got [BJP] there.  [BJP's] the mother, she knows everything about the baby. ... Yeah she was in my care.  I, well, I freaked out, mate.  I picked her up and put her on the lounge.  
169Later, when asked again why there was a delay in calling the ambulance (the accused having accepted, apparently from information provided by another police officer, that there was in fact a delay, although I do not understand he was informed of the length of the delay), the accused said:  Because [BJP] was the one lookin' at her and saying she was havin' a fit.  And I'm sayin', Ring an ambulance.  Ring an ambulance...there's my phone ring an ambulance. 
170The police then inquired of the accused whether he had discussed this matter with BJP or LB, which I understand to be a question directed not to the timing or delay in calling the ambulance but more generally as to the events of the morning.  He said that he had not spoken to the child's mother since the night of 1 April 2011 when, after leaving the police interview, he asked her to confirm that the child had actually died.  He said BJP said:...Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true.  You know, it's not your fault, Dad...And I'm saying, Look, I'm just worried about [the child]...I just couldn't believe it, mate.  It was just, the way I was talkin' to her, it was [as] if it was a fuckin' weight off her shoulders...  
171When asked the direct question whether the child's mother could have been responsible for what the police described as ""the injuries"" to the child he said:I can't, look, mate, I can't sit there and say yes, I can't say no, OK.  Simple as that.  
172When police suggested to him that he had ""an option"" he said, ""From the way I think [BJP] is, I think there could be a chance"".  Then the following exchange occurred in question and answer form which I set out in full: Q: What makes you say that?A: Well, cause you know, she'd got cuts on her and different things, and she has had a troubled life, and you know. 
Q: Yeah.  But I'm asking you, if you think that the injuries that [the child] had were caused by [BJP].  It's a simple question. A: Yeah, I know what you're saying, mate.  And I can't give you a decent answer there.  I really can't. 
Q: Have you spoken to [BJP] ...A: About the thing ... 
Q: ... about ...A: No, I haven't mate. 
Q: ... those injuries? A: No mate. 
Q: After [the child] was taken to the hospital ...A: But from ...
Q: Yeah, go on. A: But from what her mum said, and with all the phone calls, and this, that, and the other, you know, it's a possibility, you know. 
Q: How could it be a possibility if [the child] was in your care? A: 'Cause she's, oh, I don't know. 
Q: When could it have happened? A: That's what's got me stumped, mate.  I don't know. 
173The interviewing police officers concluded the interview by saying the following: Let me say on the record, that if you are covering up for [BJP] or [LB] or [AH] or [RW], now is your opportunity to come forward with the truth.  Because...if you don't... it won't do you any favours.  You need to look after your own interests. 
174The accused replied:Yeah mate, this is my life hangin' on the line here, you know.  Like, far out.  You know... I'm 45.  I haven't been in trouble all these years.  Why would I start now, you know?
175When he was pressed again by police to accept that the injuries that the child had sustained (which I interpret to be not simply the constellation of injuries to the head but the injuries to other parts of her body) were not consistent with his account of the child falling backwards from a pram and hitting her head on the tiles, he said:Well, like I said to you, I wasn't, I did not see the accident, mate.  It's as simple as that.  I heard, I didn't see, you know.  So fuckin' anything could've happened. 
176At the conclusion of the interview, when asked whether he had ever had reason to smack or assault the child, he said:...No mate, no.  In front of Sandy, right, in front of Sandy, I've gone you know, if you're ever gonna... punish a child, I believe you should go like that, and explain what's wrong or right.  And Sandy'll tell you that mate 
177When asked if he did that to the child he said:No.  No, I'm just saying, if I was ever gonna punish a person.  There was no reason.  She was a top kid.  [BJP] made out she was, you know, a real handful...She was the most easiest kid you could get along with...she was pretty top notch. 
178When asked whether he had seen anyone else assault the child he said: Yeah I've seen [BJP] hit her...it was just a smack, you know.  I didn't see it, I heard it. 
179When asked when that was he said, ""I reckon a week, two weeks ago, something like that"", and that it happened at his house.  He said he heard it: ...And I come out and saw [the child] cryin'.  And asked [BJP] what had happened.  She goes, She got in trouble.  And that's all she said.  
180He said the child was crying.  When pressed about that incident as to whether that was the only incident he had witnessed he said:Yeah.  But I think you'd probably get more out of [RW] mate...Because she has, like I said mate...you know, [BJP's] 'skitzing out' and now she's doin' this, she's doin' that, you know.  I think a lot of people will tell you that mate.  
The medical evidence
181Although the accused was not charged with any offence relating to the injuries not directly attributable to the cause of death, the Crown case was that most, if not all, of the secondary injuries were inflicted injuries, and inflicted by the accused within 24 hours of her sustaining the fatal head injury and more likely to be in a much more confined time frame.  The Crown relied substantially upon the evidence of BJP (and to a lesser extent LB) to establish that none of the secondary injuries could have been inflicted by anybody other than the accused, given their evidence that the child was left in his sole care at 5pm on 29 March 2011, and that she was, according to their evidence, active and well when they left.  
182The Crown also submitted that were I satisfied that the accused inflicted the secondary injuries, this was strongly probative of his guilt on the murder charge because it rendered his claim that the child was accidentally injured not simply improbable, but capable of supporting a finding that he was the person responsible for the infliction of the fatal injury to the criminal standard of proof.  
183At the conclusion of final addresses Ms Yehia submitted that were I to use the secondary injuries (or any of them) in the way contended for by the Crown, they constituted an intermediate step in the process of reasoning to a conclusion of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and in accordance with Shepherd v R [1990] HCA 56 HCA; 170 CLR 573, I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those injuries (or such of them that were not capable of being explained by accidental means) were inflicted by the accused before I could use them in that way.  The Crown submitted that rather than being indispensable links in a chain of reasoning to guilt, the question whether the secondary injuries (or some or most of them) were inflicted injuries is simply one of the pieces of circumstantial evidence which, together with the other evidence relied upon by the Crown, compels the conclusion that guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt.  The Crown submitted that the question whether the secondary injuries were links or strands in this sense is tested against what the Crown identified as the other evidence upon which it relied in supporting the inference of guilt, namely: The lies were told by the accused with consciousness of guilt, which necessarily involves rejecting the accused's account of the events of the morning of 30 March; and
The related fact that the fatal injury must therefore have been inflicted by him as he was the only person with the opportunity to do so given Ms Maione's evidence that the child was conscious and responsive at 10.01am.
184Reasoned in this way, the Crown submitted that the accused's infliction of the secondary injuries was simply another source of evidence from which his guilt is open to be proved without it being an indispensable link in a chain of reasoning to that conclusion.  
185If the secondary injuries are to be properly regarded as an indispensable link in a chain of reasoning to guilt, it follows that if there remains a reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who inflicted them, I must disregard them as evidence from which I would be entitled to infer that the accused inflicted the fatal injury in the way contended for by the Crown.  Even if the secondary injuries are to be treated by me simply as part of the complex of evidence from which the accused's guilt should be inferred and not an indispensable link in reasoning to that conclusion, I nonetheless consider it essential that the evidence which identifies the accused as the person who inflicted them, is both cogent and reliable.  Unless the other pieces of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown resolve or satisfactorily address any concerns about the cogency and reliability of the evidence to prove that fact, I consider it would be dangerous for me to reason to guilt in reliance upon it. 
186The related issues of when the child might have sustained the secondary injuries and, if they were inflicted injuries who inflicted them, gained considerable traction in the evidence of the lay witnesses (the child's mother in particular).  I accept that where a child with a fatal injury presents with a range of unexplained secondary injuries a high index of suspicion of a non-accidental cause from a clinical perspective is raised.  In order to ensure that in this case that did not overwhelm the question as to whether an accidental fall could be discounted as a reasonable possibility in this case, Dr Duflou and Dr Norrie were invited by me (without objection by counsel) to consider whether the injuries identified as directly associated with the cause of death, might be explained by an accidental fall of the postulated kind.  For the purpose of that exercise, they were invited to discount the secondary injuries to the left side of the child's head (potentially incorporating the left ear), the extensive bruising to the forehead revealed on reflection of the scalp, and the deep bruising to the buttocks and thigh.
187Whether the postulated but unwitnessed fall from the pram could reasonably account for the location and severity of the fatal head injury was the subject of close consideration and analysis from each of the medical witnesses.
The treatment of the fatal injury pre-mortem and the identification of the injury post-mortem
188On arrival at Coffs Harbour Hospital the child was intubated and a CT scan was performed.  At approximately 10pm she was airlifted to the Children's Hospital at Westmead where she was admitted under sedation to the paediatric intensive care unit, where she was ventilated and intubated. 
189The child was examined by Dr Norrie on 31 March 2011 after she was referred to the Child Protection Unit for an assessment of the physical harm revealed on her admission.  The child died at 6.50pm on 1 April 2011. 
190On 31 March an MRI Angiogram and an MRA of the neck were performed.  The extent of the head injury revealed by these procedures was later confirmed on post-mortem by Dr Duflou and by Dr Rodriguez.  Dr Rodriguez performed a neuropathological examination of the child's brain at Dr Duflou's request.  Dr Rodriguez also examined the child's spinal cord and eyes.  
191In so far as is relevant to the head injury which was causative of death, the following injuries are of significance:
(a) A left occipital linear skull fracture (without comminution) extending from the posterior margin of the foramen magnum (the opening in the occipital bone through which the spinal cord leaves the skull) extending, superiorly, within the occipital bone, crossing to the right of the midline and extending into the right parietal bone with associated swelling over the fracture site.  Although minimal extradural bleeding was associated with the fracture site, Dr Rodriguez noted that epidural and intradural haemorrhages underlined the fracture line.  The spinal cord showed no abnormalities.  
(b) Extensive brain changes consistent with excess fluid within the brain associated with the death of brain tissue with hemispheric infarction on the left and watershed type infarction on the right, the distribution of which involved the anterior cerebral artery.  Dr Duflou described the brain as markedly swollen.  In Dr Rodriguez's view most of the changes in the brain are a consequence of cerebral swelling with hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy resulting from a space occupying lesion in the form of an acute subdural haemorrhage of significant size.  While Dr Rodriguez attributed most of the axonal injury in the cerebrum to be of ischemic origin, he also identified diffuse (traumatic) axonal injury.  He could not exclude a fall as a possible explanation for the axonal injury.  Petechial haemorrhaging in the brain stem was also identified.
(c) Subdural haemorrhages over multiple surfaces of the brain, including both cerebral hemispheres, with relatively more blood on the left. 
(d) Bilateral, multi-layered retinal haemorrhages (involving the superficial and deep layers of the retina) and extending to the optic nerve with retinal detachment in both eyes. 
Dr Duflou
192In his preliminary report of 4 April 2011 Dr Duflou came to the following conclusions in so far as the child's head injury was concerned:The fracture of the skull, subdural bleeding and brain swelling are indicative of a significant amount of force applied to the head.  Most likely there has been at least one impact to the back of the head which has resulted in fracturing in that region.
193In the same report, Dr Duflou concluded that the multiplicity of bruises to the head was inconsistent with a simple fall from the pram since, in a fall of that kind, he would have expected the injuries to be limited to one area of the head, and not distributed over the front, back and right side of the head and the left ear.  He was also of the view that a single blow would not be sufficient to explain the constellation of injuries seen on the child.  In his opinion, there were at least three impacts to the head and ""potentially many more"".  In his evidence he accepted that they may have been sustained at different times.  He did conclude however that the cause of death was ""head injury"" with the question whether it was the result of a single or multiple impacts (blows) reserved pending further investigation.
194In Dr Duflou's final report of 4 November 2011, prepared after the detailed neuropathological examination conducted by Dr Rodriguez, and after giving some consideration to Dr Norrie's report of 12 July 2011 (in which she opined to the view that the brain injury might have been sustained in a shaking episode, a view she later abandoned), Dr Duflou confirmed his preliminary conclusions, simply adding, or emphasising, that the distribution, extent and nature of the injuries could not be explained by an accidental fall from an overbalanced pram on 30 March 2011, that being the question inherent in the information provided by police which included the stated fact that, ""The deceased's mother saw the deceased on 28 and 29 March, and observed no abnormalities"".  He also confirmed that the cause of death was a head injury, the extent and severity of which he elaborated upon in his evidence.
195As the issues at trial crystallised, neither Dr Duflou's opinion as to the cause of death, nor his evidence to the effect that a fall from the pram could not explain the constellation of injuries seen on autopsy (an opinion shared by each of the other medical experts who gave evidence), was controversial.  As I have noted, what was controversial, and what remained in issue in final addresses, was whether the Crown could discount the reasonable possibility that the fatal injury was the result of the postulated accidental fall from the pram, without recourse to the injuries secondary to the cause of death.  Again, in the issues that crystallised at trial, a further matter of controversy was whether it was appropriate and, if so, on what basis I could, or should, leave to one side consideration of the mechanism by which some or all of the secondary injuries were likely to have been inflicted, and when, and by whom, when considering that question.  
196In his evidence in chief Dr Duflou was invited by the Crown to focus on the skull fracture independently of the fatal brain injury, and the hypothesis that the fracture was caused when the child fell from a height of between 1 and 1.5 metres, as to which he said as follows: The fracturing is to the back of the head in the occipital region.  The occipital bone tends to be one of the stronger bones of the skull and one of the bones most resistant as opposed to fracturing from impact.  
There is a lot of controversy in terms of short distance falls.  My personal view is that short distance falls can cause skull fracture; they can cause significant brain damage; they can, on occasion, kill, but that is a rare outcome relative to the vast majority of short distance falls which have a benign outcome, so without fracture, without brain damage of any significant extent.  But I certainly believe that there are circumstances where a short distance fall, especially what is loosely called a complex fall, can result in an impact related skull fracture, especially if the surface that is struck is a hard surface. 
197When he was asked to take into account that there was no evidence as to whether the pram was stationary or not when the child is thought to have fallen, or whether her head hit the tiles first in the dynamics of the fall (which were themselves unknown) he said:Yes, and that of course is often the problem that - well, the exact mechanics are almost never filmed and what we need to do is try and infer what might happen on the basis of what we see after an event with an explanation given, and that can be very difficult.  In cases I have said previously, not here, if there was a filming of this event and the child did not have a skull fracture and had one after, I would accept that.  I wouldn't say, ""Well it couldn't have happened that way"".  It could explain the fracture.  Of course, we don't have any film footage but it certainly wouldn't be a matter of, ""That is absolutely impossible, I do not accept what I see"".  I would accept that quite readily, but it is an extremely rare outcome. 
198He was then asked whether a brain injury would necessarily result where there is a skull fracture.  He said:  No, not at all.  This case has very extensive brain injury, it has subdural bleeding, it has significant associated brain swelling, it has diffuse external brain injury, and those are significant brain injuries and well in excess of what you would see typically in a child who has sustained a skull fracture from a fall. 
199Finally he was asked to consider how the subdural haemorrhages might have been sustained in the hypothesised fall, and gave the following evidence:In general terms subdural haemorrhages are caused by movement of the brain relative to the dural mater and are by far the most common mechanism of that movement is a rotational movement of the head.  So in other words if the head is kept fixed and decelerated rapidly, without any movement of the head but a pure deceleration, it's very unlikely that there will be significant subdural haemorrhage type injury.  On the other hand, if there's a rotation of some type, and there are many different variations of the rotation, then subdural haemorrhage is much more likely.
Now, you don't have one mechanism in isolation of the other one but in this case any sudden rotational movement of the head, I don't know how many times but one or more movements of the head, can cause subdural haemorrhage.  Whether that occurred separate from the skull fracture or not, I don't know.  It could have occurred at the same time as the skull fracturing, although that is relatively uncommon in a fall situation in a young child to see skull fracture, firstly, skull fracture of the occipital region especially, secondly, and then significant subdural haemorrhage as well with that.  But it's on theoretical grounds certainly possible in that on impact with the ground, then there can be a second rapid movement of the head during that impact and such a movement would be more likely in a complicated fall rather than a simple fall.  
200Dr Duflou emphasised that a fall, whether complex or not, would not cause a subdural haemorrhage prior to the skull being under impact, irrespective of the rotational forces the body and head might be subject to in the process of the fall.
201The bilateral retinal haemorrhages which were identified by Dr Rodriguez and described by him as reasonably extensive and multi-layered, were regarded by Dr Duflou as ""uncommon"".  While he accepted that they could have resulted from a head injury, whether inflicted or accidental, from his experience, and after his review of the recent work undertaken at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London entitled ""The Prevalence of Retinal Haemorrhages in Critically Ill Children"" (2012), he was of the opinion that they are a more common presentation in inflicted injury, although he conceded they were not confined to head injuries sustained in that way.  In cross-examination he said:...my view is that the types of hemorrhages seen and their distribution cannot be attributed to accident versus inflicted absolutely reliably.  There's a strong association but there are exceptions.
202He was taken in re-examination to the recent London-based study to which he had referred and confirmed that of the 159 children examined only six presented with severe multi-layered retinal haemorrhages.  One of the six was an infant with a traumatic brain injury sustained in a witnessed fall from stairs whilst being carried, and a second was a child involved in a motor vehicle accident.  However, as Dr Duflou emphasised, cases of suspected or proven abusive head trauma were excluded from the study.   
203In expressing his ultimate view that the degree of force required to produce severe retinal haemorrhages is still an open question amongst experts in the field, Dr Duflou emphasised that where an accidental cause is postulated, their presentation depends, to a significant degree, on the mechanism involved in the accident and, where it involves a fall, the degree of force involved, in particular the rotational movement of the head at the time of impact and the rotational movement of the head (if any) consequent upon impact.  In that regard, he gave the following evidence:  A.  ... I really don't think you'd get anywhere near enough force applied to the force, rotational force applied to the head to cause such injuries.  It's once you hit the ground that there's a very rapid deceleration and quite possibly a rotation at the same time. 
Q.  You'd agree that in some instances short-distance falls can cause catastrophic consequences?A.  Yes.
Q.  And by catastrophic outcomes or consequences would that include the type of brain injury that we see in this case?A.  There certainly have been rare reports, and I emphasise they are rare, but rare reports of fracture of the skull in any number of locations, subdural haemorrhage and types of retinal haemorrhage, yes, with associated axonal injury as well.
Q.  So that's reasonably possible?A.  It's possible but it is a very rare event.  But certainly rare events when they occur 100 percent occur.
Dr Norrie
204Dr Norrie considered that fatalities from short distance falls, although possible, occur ""very rarely"" and in the articles where a large population study of childhood injuries was reviewed, cited in her report, severe head injury from a short distance fall was considered to be ""extremely rare"".  When she was asked in cross-examination to concede that it is ""reasonably possible"" for an injury to be caused in that way she said: A.  ... I can't accept the word ""reasonably possible"".  The Chadwick paper says fatal falls are 1 in a million children from aged 1 to 5, so I'm still struggling with the fatality of the fall and I think ""probably"" I think rather than ""reasonably"".  I'd have to say it's rare, but possible, but rare, if I can combine those two words, unlikely.  Are they the appropriate legal terms to use?
Q.  Well, you have mentioned three there.  You have said ""possible"", ""rare"", but then you added something?A.  ""Unlikely"".
205She referred in her report to two cases drawn from the study by G Reiber MD (""Fatal Falls in Childhood: How Far Must Children Fall to Sustain Fatal Head Injury?"" (1993) 14(3) The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology 201-207) of 19 fatalities where the history of a short distance fall was accepted as genuine.  In one case, a 21 month old child fell from a top bunk to a carpeted floor suggesting a height of fall of between 1.5 and 1.8 metres.  The child sustained an acute subdural haemorrhage accompanied by severe brain swelling but without any associated skull fracture.  In the second case, a 17 month old child fell backwards from a rocking chair.  That child sustained an acute left subdural haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage and a left parietal cerebral contusion, also without skull fracture.  In that case the fall was from under one metre.  In neither case was there any testing to determine whether the child sustained retinal haemorrhages.  In re-examination, the Crown took Dr Norrie to the conclusions arrived at by Reiber expressed in the following terms:The height from which children must fall to sustain fatal head trauma is a question that lacks a single, easy answer.  One has to consider the possible mechanics of the fall, the age and condition of the child, and the shape and consistency of the contact surface.  Correlation of fall mechanics and injury pattern should be considered.
The bulk of the studies on head injuries in children, regardless of viewpoint, are based on hospitalized cases.  This selects for the most serious cases and is likely to give the impression that fatalities from short falls are more prevalent than they actually are.  The conclusion that appears best at this time, with our current state of information, is that, while children on occasion suffer fatal injury from short falls, such events are an extreme rarity.  Major injuries nearly always result from major impacts and serious falls.
206In a further study authored by J Plunkett MD (""Fatal Pediatric Head Injuries Caused by Short-Distance Falls"" (2001) 22(1) The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology 1-12) also cited by Dr Norrie, there were six recorded fatalities of infants less than three years of age from falls of up to 1.5 metres, however only two falls were witnessed.  In the first case, an infant of 12 months was seated on a porch swing between her parents when the chain broke.  All three people fell backwards from about 1.5 to 1.8 metres.  The child sustained a right parietal subarachnoid haemorrhage, and a comminuted fracture of the vault of the skull with acute cerebral oedema.  In the second case, a 14 month old child was on a backyard seesaw being held in place by his grandmother.  He fell backwards, striking the grass-covered ground from a height of 0.6 metres.  Although no fracture or subdural haemorrhage was sustained, the child later died.  In the third case, a 17 month old child was in a baby carrier swing attached to an overhead tree.  The snap on the restraining bar came loose causing the child to fall from an estimated height of 1.5 to 1.8 metres.  The child died although no injuries of any particular kind were reported.  In the fourth case, a 20 month old child fell from a height of 1.7 metres from the platform of a climbing frame in a public park and struck her head on one of the support posts.  She sustained a right occipital skull fracture with subarachnoid and subdural haemorrhage.  Extensive bilateral retinal and preretinal haemorrhages were noted.  She died two days later.  In the fifth case, a 23 month old child was playing on a plastic gym set with her older brother.  When straddling a railing 0.7 metres above the ground she lost her balance and fell headfirst onto carpet covering a concrete floor.  She sustained a large right-sided subdural haematoma.  Again, no bilateral retinal haemorrhages were noted.  
207Dr Norrie agreed that the variables bearing on the question whether a short distance fall can result in death include whether the initial velocity is zero, or something other than zero, and the height of the fall.  She also agreed that there is an inseparable relationship between the measurement of impact forces engaged in a fall from a biomechanical perspective and the injuries sustained as a consequence, and that it is difficult to attempt to recreate injury sustained in dynamic circumstances.  
208She agreed with the conclusions in an article by JP Ehsani et al (""The Role of Epidemiology in Determining If a Simple Short Fall Can Cause fatal Head Injury in an Infant"" (2010) 31(3) The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology 287-298) in the following terms: The question of whether [an injury was sustained in a simple short fall] is a credible claim is inextricably linked to the circumstances of the particular case ...  For both medicine and the law, accurate prediction and/or absolute proof of causality applicable to individuals is difficult, if not impossible, in many instances. 
209The study to which Dr Norrie made reference in her report and in her evidence extracted at [204] was a study by DL Chadwick et al (""Annual Risk of Death Resulting From Short Falls Among Young Children: Less Than 1 in 1 Million"" (2008) 121(6) Pediatrics 1213-1224).  Chadwick's findings, where the statistical occurrence of a fatal fall was said to be ""one in one million"", was a statistic upon which Dr Norrie placed considerable reliance in her ultimate conclusion that the rarity of fatalities from short distance falls rendered it an unlikely explanation for the fatal injuries the child suffered in this case.  
210Dr Donald, a forensic paediatrician at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide, was called in the defence case.  Dr Donald cautioned against the bald statistic of ""one in a million"" being utilised in support of the argument that because short distance falls are rarely fatal, if death does occur, it cannot have occurred in a short distance fall.  He said it was important to understand the research undertaken by Chadwick et al and what the research was intended to explore.  As he pointed out, on a proper reading of the study, the research was undertaken to support the contention that reported short falls - less than 1.4 vertical metres in height without any additional velocity where a serious injury (including death) is sustained - should be viewed with appropriate suspicion from a clinical perspective.  With that objective in mind, Chadwick et al directed their research to enquire into the frequency with which a fatality resulted from a young child falling a short distance is reported.  In their population studies, in which, importantly, any suspicious head injuries were excluded, a statistic of one in one million was quoted.  Dr Donald expressed the following view in so far as that study was concerned:So the value of population-based studies, in my view, is to make sure that people are aware that they must be suspicious when they see young children with a serious head injury.  They must follow a process to make sure that they're not overlooking a child who may have been physically assaulted by someone, but once you move into the realm of assessment of a suspicious head injury, the population of studies no longer have any value.  
Dr Moran
211Dr Moran, Medical Director of the Child Protection Team at the Sydney Children's Hospital, was also called by the Crown.  He gave evidence both as to whether a short distance fall was capable of accounting for the fatal head injury and whether the secondary areas of bruising, or some of them, might have been caused accidentally.  
212In Dr Moran's report of 21 August 2013 he observed that the maximum height from which the child could have fallen, were she to have fallen from the footrest of the pram at full stretch, would be approximately 1.45 metres.  He observed that the surface onto which the child was alleged to have fallen was tiled.  Since the fall was not witnessed, and having no expertise in biomechanics, Dr Moran was not able to offer an opinion as to whether the child could have fallen in the manner described, or if there was any added velocity from the movement of the pram or from the child losing her balance.
213He did however offer the following opinion:An occipital impact onto a non-yielding surface from a height of approximately 1.5 metres, particularly if there was an initial accelerative component, would be associated with high impact and rotational forces.  There is experimental evidence which corroborates this view ... Clinical experience in adults with unprotected falls onto the back of the head also supports the view that serious and fatal injury may occur.  There is a well described witnessed case ... of a 13 year old with a similar fall from a similar distance who sustained an occipital fracture and who subsequently died...
214He was also of the opinion that the head injuries identified at post-mortem had what he described as, ""all the hallmarks of occipital impact"" and that the sequence of clinical events, including the observations of Dr Robertson on her admission to Coffs Harbour Hospital, were coincident with a significant injury to the brain stem resulting from a severe primary rotational deceleration injury.  This (the traumatic axonal injury) would not, in his view, in itself be fatal.  In his view, the rotational injury would also result in the bilateral thin film subdural haemorrhages seen on imaging and at post-mortem, and that the greater degree of brain swelling on the left side was presumably due to primary impact trauma on that side. 
215Ultimately, in his report Dr Moran expressed the following opinion: It is not possible to distinguish between primary accidental and inflicted head injuries based on their appearance.  One has to examine the circumstances of the injury to see whether there are irreconcilable inconsistencies in some aspect of the presentation which would heighten the suspicion that the story was untrue.  As the postulated event was unwitnessed all that one can say is that this degree of injury, while it would be rare, could occur under the most extreme of the circumstances outlined if it could be shown that such a fall were possible.  It goes without saying that any other kind of impact, such as a blow, were it delivered with the same amount of energy, could result in a similar outcome.
216In his evidence, he offered the following further contribution to the question whether the constellation of head injuries might be potentially explained by the postulated fall in the following terms: A.  I think there are two concepts here, your Honour.  There's an epidemiological one, in other words, how frequently do these sorts of injuries occur under the circumstances outlined and then there is the biomechanical one.  Is it possible that under the circumstances outlined that it could have the result that we see here.  I think the answer to the first, the epidemiological one, is that it is rare, very rare, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it wouldn't happen.  And from - I think from a biomechanical standpoint if you look at the worst case scenario here, then I think I would accept that it is possible that these injuries could occur under the circumstances outlined.
Q.  And when you talk about the biomechanical configurations, you are, I assume, postulating that the pram moved under some acceleration or speed or force and that the child was also for that reason thrown or fell under some force with a rotational movement of the head not so much through the area in the path of the fall but on impact with the tiled surface, is that what you talk about when you talk about the -A.  Well, your Honour, I am not sure whether or not there was any movement of the pram, I don't know the answer to that.  But I think that even if there weren't - if there were, it would add velocity to the impact.  If - even if there weren't, I think that a straight fall on to the back of the head on to tiles, one could reasonably expect that you would have very high impact velocity which would cause a severe rotation of the brain within the skull causing all of the injuries that we see, and of course, the impact causing the fracture as well, and my view would be that the impact would be so severe that one could reasonably expect to see retinal haemorrhages of the degree that we see here.
Biomechanical evidence
217Professor Pandy, the Chair of Biomechanical Engineering at the University of Melbourne, was called by the defence.  His professional appointments and academic achievements both in Australia and the United States of America are extensive. 
218He was retained to provide an opinion as to whether a fall from a pram from a distance of approximately one metre could result in a fracture of the skull.  For the purposes of providing that opinion he applied a mathematical analysis to a simulated fall of a person of the height and weight of the child from a pram of the height and dimensions of the pram exhibited in the trial. 
219A set of primary equations, in turn referable to a number of key theoretical concepts, were utilised by him to determine the position and velocity of a body, released with an initial velocity from a known point in space, the moment before it impacts the ground.  The purpose in applying that calculus to the postulated fall in this case was to determine how the body of the child might have rotated through the air in the course of the fall before her head struck the ground and to allow for an estimate of how fast her head was moving at the point of impact with the tiles and within milliseconds after the point of impact.  
220The key concepts utilised by Professor Pandy included the ""projectile motion theory"" (utilising Newton's second law of motion) which describes the trajectory of a body in the process of, or in the course of a fall.  That was applied in this case in order to calculate how the body of the child moved from its assumed initial configuration (standing upright in the pram) to its final configuration (on her back on the tiles) at the instant before the point of impact.  A second concept, ""the impact force"" (or the amount of force the head is subject to on impact), is determined by the relationship between impulse and changes in momentum as a result of the collision.  A third concept, ""the coefficient of restitution"", is a value calculated by reference to the degree of compliance in the surface upon which the body or object falls (in this case the tiles in the foyer of the accused's home) and the degree of stiffness or ""give"" in the object that is dropped (in this case the child's head or skull).  
221The ""known point in space"" from which the fall was assumed to have been initiated for professor Pandy's purposes was 96 centimetres above the ground, the height of the child as detailed in Dr Duflou's post-mortem report, based on the assumption that the child was standing at full height in the pram before she fell backwards.  Professor Pandy also used the child's height to calculate the centre of mass of her body in a standing position.  He also assumed that the child's head contacted the ground first.  A schematic diagram of the body in the anatomical position was reproduced in Professor Pandy's report together with a further schematic diagram of the initial and final positions of the child's body during a simulated fall.
222Professor Pandy acknowledged that a limitation inherent in the mathematical modelling utilised by him is the assumption that the child's body fell on a fixed plane from the vertical and at an angle to the horizontal with her feet as a pivot, which necessitated ignoring the potential effect of the child's arms, legs and torso breaking her fall.  He acknowledged in his report and confirmed in his evidence that it is possible, and perhaps even likely, that the limbs and torso of the child would contact the ground first during a backwards fall in which case the impact and velocity on her head would be lower than the modelled analysis.  It was also assumed that at some point in the course of the interplay of the unknown physical factors which initiated the fall, that a horizontal force impulse acted on the pram to produce horizontal displacement.  Although the speed at which the pram would have moved to initiate the fall was able to be calculated, the degree of horizontal displacement (or the distance over which the pram moved on the floor and the direction it moved) was incalculable mathematically because the time over which the pram moved before the child's head impacted with the floor was not known.
223In determining, from a mathematical perspective, the degree of force applied to the head of the child during impact (a force measured in newtons - N), Professor Pandy took a number of factors into account, including the velocity of the child's feet at the instant her body left the pram in a backward oriented fall; the distance over which the centre of mass of her body moved during the fall; the centre of mass of the head; the duration of the impact between the head and the ground; the gravitational acceleration constant (9.81 m/s²); and, finally, the coefficient of restitution.  
224As Professor Pandy recognised in his report, measurement of the coefficient of restitution and duration of impact, two critical parameters required in the calculation of head impact force for the paediatric human head, are largely unknown.  In sourcing this information from the literature, he drew extensively from a recently published study on the effect of impact forces on head injury.  The author, AM Loyd, used the heads of nineteen cadavers of varying age from neonate to adult, with one in the age bracket of the deceased child in this trial.  The study was published by Loyd as a PhD thesis at Duke University in North Carolina in the United States (""Studies of the Human Head from Neonate to Adult: An Inertial, Geometrical and Structural Analysis with Comparisons to the ATD Head""). 
225In Professor Pandy's opinion, the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University is one of the two most reputable institutions undertaking work in the field, the other being the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.  Two of the committee members before whom Loyd's thesis was defended were known personally to the Professor, one of whom was Loyd's supervisor.  In these circumstances, and after giving critical consideration to the hypotheses, methodology, calculus and results reported by Loyd, Professor Pandy was, in my view, entitled to afford the data produced by Loyd a considerable degree of credence, despite the fact that it had not since been validated by subsequent experiments, and despite what Loyd acknowledged were the necessary limitations in his research, as a result of the fact that specimens of human heads are not readily available for research purposes.  It took Loyd fifteen years to collect the specimens used in the experiments. 
226In the controlled experiments conducted by Loyd, each specimen (being the head of the cadaver with the skull, brain tissue and head tissue intact, but with the mandible detached) was dropped from a height of 15 centimetres and 30 centimetres successively five times, with the drop directed at five different locations on the skull commencing with the forehead and extending to the occiput, the vertex and the left and right parietal.  In each case the head was dropped onto an aluminium plate fitted with a force sensor that was able to measure impact force, location and duration (of impact).  Measurements of impact force were also used to record the change in acceleration, and therefore velocity and displacement of the head during the impact.  
227Loyd found that between the ages of 5 and 22 months the human head was susceptible to fracture from drops of 15 centimetres.  It was also shown that the peak acceleration imparted to the head during impact increased with age, whereas the duration of impact and coefficient of restitution both decreased with age.  Loyd ultimately reported that only three of the nineteen skulls revealed a skull fracture, with all three in the paediatric group, and in each case a linear and diastatic fracture was identified with impact forces ranging between 392 and 1074 N.    
228A further and acknowledged limitation in Loyd's research resulted from the need for repetitious dropping of the nineteen specimens, a situation which would not be seen in a clinical setting where an individual would usually only suffer a ""one hit"" impact sufficient to fracture the skull.  In Professor Pandy's view, the potential for that limitation to skew the results he obtained from a mathematical perspective was mediated by the fact that Loyd performed a CT scan after each drop to ensure that if the skull fractured it was not used again.  Self evidently, as Professor Pandy acknowledged, and Loyd himself acknowledged, it would have been preferable to perform one vertical drop on each specimen however the difficulty in obtaining specimens prevented that approach being adopted.  
229After assigning values to all parameters required for the mathematical calculation undertaken by Professor Pandy, nominal average values were assigned to the coefficient of restitution and impact duration - the latter drawn from the Loyd's study and the former from the experimental data reported by Viano and Parenteau in 2008 (""Analysis of Head Impacts Causing Neck Compression Injury"").  In applying the mathematical formula devised by Professor Pandy, appropriate allowance was made for the child's body to be inclined at an angle to the ground upon impact so that the head impacted the ground first.  Assuming that the child was standing on the seat of the pram prior to the fall (the scenario ultimately relied upon by Ms Yehia in closing submissions) the angular velocity of the body during the fall was estimated to be 4.57 rad/sec (clockwise), and the vertical velocity of the head just before impact 5.44 m/s (downward).  The corresponding head impact force was then estimated to be 2003 N - higher than the highest newtonic value in Loyd's research.  When Professor Pandy considered a worst case analysis for the modelled conditions (namely the maximum value for the coefficient of restitution and the minimum value of the duration of impact forces) an estimated head impact force onto ceramic tiles predicted a maximum head impact force of 4276 N, again significantly higher than the results of the Loyd experiments.  
230In the result, Professor Pandy concluded that while it was not possible to determine precisely the probability of a skull fracture in the event of a fall of the postulated kind, the modelled calculations he adapted and applied indicated that such an outcome was possible.  He conceded in cross-examination, that his modelling could not appoint the site of the fracture, the extent of fracture or inform the extent of the injury to the brain or other injury to the head.  He also acknowledged that in respect of the three paediatric skulls which were fractured in the Loyd experiments (respectively children aged 5 months, 11 months and 22 months), the fracture occurred on the right parietal of first child, the same for the second child and at the vertex of the child of 22 months. 
231When asked in cross-examination to concede that the conclusions are affected by the limitations inherent in Loyd's study, Professor Pandy said as follows: Q.  Accepting it is a limitation, do you accept that your conclusions are affected by the limitations inherent in the study that Loyd has done? A.  You see, the reason I investigated a range of values in my model was precisely to take into account that there are things, many things that just are just not known very precisely here.  The model itself I couched is not a precise model.  The only way you can get understanding is to investigate a range of parameters that one feels is reasonable which is what I have done, and the range of parameters for the duration of impact cover the range that Loyd has measured.  Yes, there's limitations in the fact he dropped the head repeatedly, but there were also measures taken to minimise those limitations; for example, the fact that they did CT scan the specimen carefully after each drop. 
Q.  Let's discuss the limitations of the study in more detail.  Do you accept the premises of my question which is if there are limitations in his study, there must necessarily be limitation to your conclusions? A.  Yes.  I already said there are limitations to my analysis. 
Q.  These are limitations [additional] to the ones you set out because these are the ones inherent in the study upon which you rely; do you see the difference? A.  Yeah.  Well, yes.  There is a difference in that respect.  But again, what is built into my estimates are the fact I didn't use just one value that Loyd measured.  I said, okay, well this is the mean of what they measured.  I took a mean value from their spread of data and then I changed that value by a significant amount.  So the calculations I made are, give you some feel for, well, if you don't know things very accurately and there are things that are going to change, well, give you like a minimum and maximum, an idea of the minimum and maximum value of what to expect.  That's all, ultimately, I think all you can do in a model calculation. 
232The utility of applying an additional limitation, which in the Crown's submission was significant in applying the research data collected by Loyd for current purposes, is that the data reported upon had no data for the skull of a child between 23 months and 8 years of age and, in addition, in so far as the fact that there was no mandible attached to the head of the cadavers used in the experiments, there was an open question as to what effect that would, or might have on the question of peak acceleration as the head was dropped on to the sensor plate.   
233While Professor Pandy acknowledged the limitations Loyd himself acknowledged in his published thesis, he did not accept the proposition put to him in cross-examination that those limitations limited the utility of Loyd's data for his mathematical modelling.  As Professor Pandy explained, for his purposes he adopted an average from the range of results reported by Loyd.  He sought to emphasise that his modelling was not, and could not, be absolutely precise but it could appoint where, in a range of possibilities to probabilities, a fracture to the skull might be sustained in the scenario he was asked to consider.  He went on to say:...I think when all is said and done, and I have tried to do as thorough a job as possible, you can only really in the end say, well, is it possible?  And that's what I have tried to do.
The secondary injuries
234It was common ground between all of the medical experts that some of the areas of secondary bruising could not be explained by, or otherwise associated with a short distance fall of the kind relied upon by the accused as explaining the fatal head injury given that, on his case, she must have fallen backwards.  They included the extensive bruising to the child's forehead (including the left eyebrow and the left eyelid); the punctate bruising to the right parietal area of the scalp; bruising to both ears; bruising to both buttocks (given the shape and arrangement of those bruises); and the extensive bruise to the left thigh.  
235These areas of bruising and their size, dimension and general appearance were described in similar terms by Dr Norrie in the pre-mortem examination and by Dr Duflou in the post-mortem examination.  At the trial, that aspect of their evidence was not controversial.  
236Save for the bruising to the right ear, all of the areas of bruising and abrasion noted by Dr Norrie on 31 March were noted by Dr Duflou macroscopically.  The bruises on the left ear were confirmed by him on microscopic examination.  While the sampled tissue taken from the left ear, the right anterior scalp, the left eyelid and left abdomen were not able to be confirmed as bruising microscopically, with the exception of the bruise to the abdomen, all were confirmed to be bruises on immunohistochemical staining.  On dissection the bruising to the left thigh and buttocks passed through the fat to the level of the musculature.  No other injuries were identified in the process of dissection or radiographically.  
237In addition to the areas of bruising noted by Dr Norrie pre-mortem, bruising on the surface of the child's scalp, both in the area of the fracture at the base of the skull and in the right parietal region (an area unrelated to the fracture) site were revealed after the child's head was shaved in the autopsy.  (As noted above, this area was sampled and bruising was confirmed after staining.)  The extent of bruising to the child's forehead was also only obvious after the scalp had been reflected.  
238Although there remained some controversy in the medical evidence, and in final addresses, as to whether the external bruising to the child's forehand in the area of the left temple could have been sustained accidentally in the way said to have been witnessed by BJP and the accused when she bumped into a hall table, even were this a possible explanation it seemed to be the settled position that the extensive bruising to the forehead revealed on reflection of the scalp could not be explained by that mechanism.  There was also some controversy as to whether the extensive bruise to the child's left thigh and the punctate bruising on the right side of her scalp might be explained by accidental falls onto a toy (the bruising to the thigh) or onto carpet (the bruise on the scalp).  It was, however, common ground that the bilateral bruising to ears was most likely, if not definitely, the result of inflicted injury.  Ms Yehia also accepted that the spread and depth of the bruising to the buttocks (even discounting the potential incorporation of the bruise to the thigh) could not readily be explained by an accidental cause.   
239All of the medical experts cautioned against drawing any conclusion about the age of any of the cutaneous bruising from the macroscopic colour or appearance of the bruises.  Furthermore, in Dr Duflou's view, despite what he regarded as the ""current dogma"" to the effect that a yellow or brown discolouration in the hue of a bruise was an indication that the trauma which was the source of the bruise must have been sustained or inflicted at least 18 hours earlier, in this case that analysis could not be confidently applied because there was minimal inflammation in the bruises (where inflammation is an indication of a healing process) and because the child had been hospitalised at least 18 hours before she died.  He said, using this case as an example, the ageing of bruising is:...very very difficult, and there's certainly research that has been done that shows, especially in the setting of children with head injuries, that you can have significant delaying of inflammation of bruising... 
240Leaving aside the recognised difficulties associated with attempting to appoint a time, or even a time frame within which the trauma that resulted in the areas of secondary bruising in this case occurred from the appearance of the bruises at post-mortem, the Crown also asked for Dr Duflou's views as to when, after the application of force sufficient for there to be a bleeding into the tissue, it might be expected that a bruise would be visible or signs of it apparent.  As to that question, he said that while generally bruising tends to appear not long after the injury causing a rupture of small blood vessels within the skin is sustained (probably anything from minutes to usually not more than an hours) there are also very well known circumstances where bruising may appear a day or two later.  
241In addition to the difficulty in aging bruises and appointing a time frame within which they might have been sustained with reasonable certainty, it is also significant that the appearance of some of the bruises changed from when the child was examined pre-mortem by Dr Norrie on 31 March 2011 and at post-mortem, in particular the bruising to the right ear.  Dr Norrie reported multiple petechial bruises inside the right upper helix of the ear and a two centimetre long area of interrupted diffuse bruising behind the right ear lobe (plainly discernible in the photographs forming part of Exhibit JJJ), whereas at post-mortem that bruising was no longer apparent, to the extent that Dr Duflou discounted it in his report.  On the other hand, the bruising to the inner and outer aspects of the left ear (indistinguishable in appearance from the photographs of the right ear taken pre-mortem) was confirmed histologically.  In Dr Norrie's view, the extent of the bilateral bruising was most likely the result of a gripping or pinching or pulling of the child's ears, or the result of a slap to the side of the head or a cupped slap delivered to both sides of the head.  Although Dr Duflou accepted that a direct blow to the ears could cause the bruising seen pre-mortem, and to the left ear at post-mortem, he did not exclude the possibility that the bruising to the left ear (when viewed in isolation) was referred blood from the back of the scalp towards the ear.  However, accepting that the pre-mortem photographs show bruising similar in appearance in both the inner and outer aspects of both ears, he considered gravitational blood flow an unlikely explanation.
242Another discrepancy, or potential discrepancy in the bruises observed pre-mortem and post-mortem, was the bruising to the abdomen.  While Dr Norrie noted an area of ""faint bruising"" to the upper torso of the child medial to her left nipple, five areas of discrete, albeit faint bruising were noted by Dr Duflou to the torso of the child (right and left of the midline generally superior to the umbilicus in varying distances between 20mm and 120mm) and which he described, from a macroscopic perspective, as ""looking to all the world like bruises"".  A tissue sample was taken to confirm the presence of bruising from one only of these ""bruises"" which produced a negative result.   
243Dr Norrie reported bruising to both the left and right of the child's forehead, with bruising to the right side of the forehead associated with a superficial linear abrasion medial and parallel to the bruising on the left side on the left upper eyelid, left eyebrow and the left forehead near the hairline.  These bruises were photographed in the pre-mortem photographs and the subject of close questioning at trial as to whether they might have been sustained accidentally and, in particular, whether the bruising to the left of the child's forehead near the hairline might be explained by the child running into the hall table and hitting her head, with the bruises below that (to the eyebrow and eyelid) being either referred bruising, or bruising that developed over time because of the force of the impact to the temple.  
244On external examination Dr Duflou described a diffuse and mottled discolouration of the child's forehead with focal discolouration but without any obvious discrete bruises identified.  He did however identify a red/blue bruise on the left upper eyelid.  
245The bruises generally to the forehead noted by both Dr Norrie and Dr Duflou correlated, to a very limited extent only, with the extensive and what Dr Duflou described as ""dramatic amount of bruising"" to the forehead and scalp generally revealed on dissection.  In Dr Duflou's opinion, the discrepancy between an external and internal examination of a site of bruising was not uncommon.  He gave evidence that the likely explanation for the discrepancy in this case is that the depth of the bruising to the child's forehead was not apparent externally to any significant extent at any time whilst the child was alive.  
246In Dr Duflou's view, the broad and diffuse area of bleeding over the forehead area on reflection of the scalp was well in excess of what he would have expected, and more diffuse than what he would have expected were the child to have accidentally stumbled into the edge of the hall table photographed in the crime scene photographs, particularly given that in neither the pre-mortem or post-mortem photographs of the left side of the forehead was there any abrasion or laceration to the skin.  In his view, the bruising was more likely explained by an impact with a broad surface, such as the ground or the top of a table, or impact with a fist, in each case under considerable force.  He was unable to say whether the bruising to the forehead was the result of one injury or multiple injuries or whether there was an overlap of multiple injuries, or a single injury with various bruises appearing on various parts of the head.
247Dr Moran was of the opinion that some of the bruising on what he described as the ""anterior forehead"" might be explained by bumping into the hall table, however, in his view, the pattern of bruising and abrasion to the right forehead did not appear to be explained by that mechanism, and the very extensive bruising to the scalp on reflection (other than the bruising over the occipital region), and the bruising of the left upper eyelid and the bruising of both ears, remained unexplained.  He said bruising of the ears is very unusual in accidental falls and is very likely associated with inflicted injury when it is bilateral and unexplained. 
248I have excluded from consideration the suggestion in Dr Donald's evidence that the bruising to the ears might be explained by the management of the child by medical staff in Coffs Harbour, whilst in transit, or at Westmead Children's Hospital.  I do accept his evidence that if an accidental mechanism is excluded, force applied directly to the head or the head coming into contact with something under force is a likely mechanism for the bruising to the inner aspect of the pinna of the child's ear, extending as it did beyond the cartilage of the ear and into the vascular tissue at the back of the ears.
249The punctate bruising in the right tempoparietal region of the scalp, also identified only after the scalp was reflected, was, in Dr Duflou's opinion, also likely to be the result of direct impact.  It was not suggested that there was any relationship between that area of bruising and the extradural haemorrhage associated with the site of the skull fracture.  While it was minor as compared with the extent and depth of bruising to the forehead, and although Dr Duflou was unable to offer an opinion as to the degree of force that might be required to generate the bruising, he agreed it would likely be the result of contact with a surface that was not smooth given the patterned appearance of the bruising.  In cross-examination he conceded that he could not exclude the possibility that it was the result of an accidental fall on carpet, but thought it less likely that it was the result of a fall onto gravel in a playground.  He was not able to appoint a time at which that injury was sustained relative to the fatal injury.
250In his autopsy report Dr Duflou identified and described a grouping of bruises to both buttocks that were blue/brown in appearance and a predominantly blue bruise on the left upper thigh which struck him at that time (indeed, as he said in evidence, one thing that he recalled distinctly about the case) as giving the distinct impression of being a handprint.  Photograph number 59 in Exhibit OOO is a photograph of Dr Duflou's left hand simulating the orientation of an adult (left) hand across the buttocks of the child.  (The accused is right handed.  There was no evidence as to whether BJP or LB were right or left handed.)  Dr Duflou said that the potential handprint did not seem obvious to him in the pre-mortem photographs, but it was sufficiently obvious to him at post-mortem to take the photograph of his gloved hand in position over the bruises, something he said he did not do lightly.  Despite the fact that there was more intense discolouration in the bruising on the thigh externally which, on dissection, extended beyond the fat into the muscle, Dr Duflou also identified deep bruising into the buttocks themselves on dissection.  He regarded that injury as well in excess of a ""standard style disciplinary smack of a child's bottom"" but, rather, it was ""a rare type of injury to see in a child"" implying the application of ""more force rather than less force"". 
251Dr Moran described bruising over the buttocks, in what he described as a ""patterned injury"", as a very unusual place for an accidental injury.  Assuming the bruise to the thigh was incorporated into the ""handprint"", Dr Moran was also unable to readily see how a deep bruise on the left upper thigh could occur in a fall unless it was from a height sufficient to impact on the tissue causing the depth of bruising revealed on autopsy.  When asked to consider whether a fall onto the toy car, a photograph of which was exhibited at the trial, might explain the area of bruising, he said he could not discount it entirely, but emphasised that it would depend upon the height of the impact (which I take to mean the degree to which the fall onto the toy car was under force).  He also observed that the bruise could also be caused when the child was struck with an implement, thrown against a surface or kicked.  
The issue of the child's vitamin C levels
252Dr Norrie noted in her report of 6 June 2011 that upon examination of the child at Westmead, a low vitamin C level of 19 was detected (with the normal range being 40 to 100).  It was her evidence that the low vitamin C level was not of any significance in this case because, although the level was ""a bit low"", it was not low enough to cause bleeding, and did not indicate anything about the rapidity of the resolution of a bruise after trauma as the vitamin C level would have to be low over a sustained period of time for that to occur.  Dr Norrie observed that there was nothing in the child's medical history to suggest any longstanding vitamin C deficiency.  She also expressed the view that the reading of 19 would likely not be accurate as the child was dying at the time the levels were taken which would not accurately reflect her state of health pre-injury.  
253Dr Duflou also accepted that although the vitamin C level was low, there were no pathological or clinical features indicating the child suffered from scurvy (signs of scurvy include bleeding gums, easy bruising and subperiosteal haemorrhages).  He said:...I really don't think that, taken together with the clinical information, that there was any propensity to bleeding and certainly this was not a case of rip-roaring scurvy.
254Dr Moran was also of the view that the low reading was not significant and, further, it was unlikely that it was a true representation of the child's vitamin C level in any event.  In his experience it is extraordinarily rare to find a low vitamin C level in children in Australia if they are fed normally.  There was nothing in the findings on autopsy to suggest the child was malnourished or undernourished.
255I am satisfied that the medical evidence indicates that the child's vitamin C level of 19 is of no forensic significance.  
Reasoning to verdict
The tendency evidence
256Over objection, and before BJP was called to give evidence, I permitted the accused to elicit evidence to establish that she had a tendency to behave in a violent manner when she was frustrated or when she otherwise felt out of control (R v FEW [2013] NSWSC 1486). 
257The evidence admitted as tendency evidence was limited to the following incidents:
(1)  On 30 January 2011 BJP repeatedly punched her mother to the face causing extensive bruising at a time when her mother was in a wheelchair;
(2)  In February 2011 BJP tightened the straps on the child's pram to restrain the child at which time she said she did not care how tight the straps were or if they bruised the child.  On another occasion, at about the same time, she physically pushed the child back into the pram by holding her face or placing her hand over the child's face and forcefully pushing her backwards into the pram.
258The accused tendered a number of documents, produced under subpoena to the Department of Family and Community Services, where the following matters were recorded as notifications of ""risk assessment reports"", mandatorily reported under the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998, as proof of BJP's tendency to lose control and act in a violent manner.
259An ""Assessment Record"" dated 17 February 2011 records:There was an incident of family violence between the mother and the maternal grandmother on Sunday 30/01/2011.  This occurred at the maternal grandmother's house.  The mother told caller that she ""lost the plot"" with the maternal grandmother and punched her to the face.  She said that she was ""out of control"".  She did not say what had led up to the violence.  The maternal grandmother reportedly has bruises on her face as a result of the assault by the mother.  The mother stated that during the violent incident the maternal grandmother had accidentally bumped into [JP] with her wheelchair.  [JP] is reported not to have been harmed.  The mother did not say how [JP] was when she witnessed the violence.  Police were not called.
260A ""Contact Record"" dated 7 February 2011 records:The caller is adding information to a report that was made on the 03/02/11.  The caller stated maternal grandmother RW informed the caller on Friday 05/02/11 she observed the mother placing [JP] into the pram and tightening the straps to ensure [JP] could not move.  The mother stated she didn't care how tight it was and if it bruised [JP].
There was no reaction from [JP].
The grandmother also stated about two weeks ago [JP] was sitting in the pram and she had leaned forward when the mother placed her hand  over her face and shoved her backwards.  Again there was no reaction from [JP].
261A briefing note from 2011 records:...Other issues of concern included [BJP] being overly physical with [JP] (eg pushing, making stroller restraints too tight) and ongoing personal violence between family members.
Use of the pram to physically harm
262In her evidence in chief, BJP admitted to having the straps on the pram ""quite tight"" but said she did that in order to stop the child from running onto the road.  She said that she did not intend the tightening of the straps to hurt the child, but only to protect her.  She denied ever tightening the straps to the extent that it caused bruising.  She also rejected the suggestion that she had a disagreement with her mother about the tightness of the pram straps, and she further denied that she said to her mother words to the effect that she did not care whether the straps caused the child ""to bruise"".  She said that the child never complained about the straps being too tight or that they were hurting her.  She said that the child would often lean forward in the pram and that when she did so, she would lift the child under the arms and sit her back down.  She also denied putting her hand over the child's face and ""shoving"" the child backwards. 
263BJP agreed in cross-examination that she was an overprotective mother, however she rejected the suggestion that this motivated her to restrain the child in the pram whenever she could, or that she did so because the child was difficult to control.  She did concede that, on occasions, the child would fall asleep restrained in her pram.  She said this was because the child was tired and would watch a movie whilst in the pram and subsequently fall asleep.  
264In cross-examination, RW said that she had seen BJP and the child interact on many occasions.  She also confirmed that she had often seen BJP put the child into the pram.  However when it was put to her that, at times, BJP strapped the child into the pram too tightly, she said: No, there was one occasion where she strapped her in.  [The child] was mucking up.  [BJP] - this was on the same day that she was really agitated - [BJP] was very upset and I'm really thinking that was when [the child's father] went off...  
265She went onto say:[The child] didn't want to get in the pram and [BJP] placed her in the pram because me and [BJP] got into an argument, which I can't remember what it was about - and [the child] was getting upset, and she didn't want to get into the pram, and when she is like that she will try and get out, and [BJP] put her in there and she did place the straps on firm which I would say firm, but they weren't tight, tight, but they were placed so [the child] could not actually get out of the pram. 
266RW denied that BJP said to her that she did not care if the child would be bruised as a result of strapping the child into the pram.  RW was not asked by the Crown or Ms Yehia whether she ever saw BJP place her hand over the child's face and proceed to ""shove"" her backwards.
267LB was also asked whether the child had been strapped into her pram as a form of discipline.  He said that he had only seen it once, that it was only for a couple of minutes and both he and BJP were right beside her.  He said BJP strapped the child into the pram so that she could not run onto the road.  
The fight between BJP and RW on 30 January 2011
268BJP acknowledged that she was involved in a verbal and physical altercation with her mother at her mother's home.  
269BJP did not recall why the argument erupted, however she remembered telling her mother that she was leaving and did not know if she may ever return, which made her mother extremely upset.  She said as she attempted to leave by taking the pram (with the child in it), RW ran into the back of her legs with her electric wheelchair, causing BJP to collide with the pram.  Shouting ensued, which subsequently led to physical violence.  BJP said she was pinned against the front door and that RW took hold of her hair.  She retaliated by pulling her mother's hair and punching her in the face one to three times.  She said this made her mother let go of her hair, and she and the child then left.  As they were leaving via the ramp in the front yard, RW followed them, grabbed BJP's skirt and asked for her house keys to be returned to her.  She said that she threw the keys on the verandah.
270Photographs dated 2 February 2011 were tendered which showed extensive bruising and swelling to RW's face, including to her left eye and a vertical abrasion angled from her right eye.
271In cross-examination, BJP denied that she punched her mother in the face because of a loss of control on her part, or even that she was angry with her mother.  She said it was because she felt confined and needed to leave the house, as it was a dangerous environment for her daughter.  She conceded that the first time she made a statement to police in relation to the altercation was in October 2013.
272While there was a level of consistency between the versions of events given by BJP and her mother in evidence, there were material differences. 
273RW said that when BJP attempted to leave via the front door, she asked her to return her house key, and acknowledged that she came up behind BJP in her electric wheelchair and positioned herself directly behind the pram so that BJP could not open the front door.  RW said that what followed was ""a struggle"" where her daughter ""pulled"" her head down by her hair to the armrest of her wheelchair which had been ""chipped away"" from an earlier collision with the brick wall.  RW said that it was the damaged armrest which bruised the left side of her face, just under her left eye.  
274RW denied that BJP intentionally punched her in the face.  She said the bruises were caused by another incident which occurred prior to the altercation with BJP, involving her dog.  She said there was a bone on the ramp at the front of her premises which tipped her wheelchair over, which subsequently caused her to collide with the ground.  RW confirmed that she was in her electric wheelchair during the physical altercation with BJP on 30 January 2011 and that she was hospitalised in February 2011 for back pain, due in part to the fight with her daughter.  
275When asked why she wanted her front door key back, RW said that she was an overprotective person with respect to her home, and she did not want her daughter, or any of her friends to be there whilst she was not present, but said that she did not have a chance to talk with her daughter about this, as ""[BJP] was agitated about another situation"".  She said this was either about the child's father (BJP's ex-boyfriend) being alerted to the fact that she had a new boyfriend, or because he had damaged the property of Warrina Refuge, or because she was concerned about the delay in receipt of her Centrelink payments.  RW confirmed however that, regardless of the reason, BJP was stressed and anxious on 30 January 2011.  
276After the altercation with her mother, BJP said that she went to the accused's residence and confided in him.  She said she requested that he check on her mother.  BJP also said that she and her mother did not talk for ""a little while"", however by 2 March they were on speaking terms, as evidenced by the text messages sent that day (as set out at [51]).  
277After the argument, BJP said that she had bruises on her chin, arms and legs.  BJP disclosed to staff at Warrina Refuge that she and her mother had a fight, and she was told that a report would be made. 
278BJP was also asked about the methods she used to discipline her daughter.  She said she used to tap the back of the child's hand, remove toys or lollies, or she used the ""big voice"".  She said that when she used this voice she did not yell, however it was a stern and deep voice.  BJP disagreed with the suggestion that her voice made the child flinch away from her.  She conceded that at times she did ""tap the child on the bottom"" but that it was done through the child's nappy.  She disagreed that she got frustrated with the child because she was ""a handful"".  
279It was put to her in cross-examination that when she felt anxious or stressed, she would lose control with the child, as she did with RW, which she denied.  She said that she could always cope with and look after her daughter and that she never reached a point where she could not cope with her.  
280LB gave evidence that he personally did not discipline the child, and that he never saw BJP being violent towards the child.  He had never seen BJP smack her, however he said that he saw her give the child ""a little tap on the hand"".  He was unable to recall when he saw this.  He said that he also saw BJP put the child in her cot or pram for five minutes (the latter he had only seen once).
Questions of credit
281In respect of the evidence of a number of lay witnesses, issues of credit were raised in the addresses of both counsel.  Independent of counsel's submissions, I had my own concerns about both the honesty and reliability of some witnesses. 
282I am conscious of the need to be cautious and considered before drawing too ready a finding (either in favour of a witness or adverse to them) from their demeanour in the witness box.  I accept that different people react to a courtroom environment in different ways and that some coping mechanisms might give the appearance of disinterest, on the one hand, or nervousness and agitation on the other, without necessarily reflecting adversely on a witness' credit.  I am also conscious that a concern about one aspect of a witness' evidence, whether as to their truthfulness, accuracy or reliability, need not necessarily justify my rejecting the evidence of that witness in its entirety.  I am however unable to avoid making some observations as to the demeanour of some witnesses, in particular the child's mother, her boyfriend and her mother from which I do draw adverse inferences as to their credit and which has had the effect of impacting on some of the critical issues to which this trial has given rise, and the resolution of those issues.
283As earlier noted, I confirm that I accept, unreservedly, Dr McClure's evidence as to his dealings with the accused by telephone at 9.46am on 30 March 2011.  His evidence was forthright and considered.  Despite his statement not being provided to police until well after the investigation into the death of the child which had resulted in the accused being charged with murder (itself some months after the child's death), I accept his evidence that the conversation with the accused was sufficiently fixed in his memory for him to be able to reliably recount it well after the event without any clinical note.  
284The question that survives Dr McClure's evidence - a significant question giving the chronology of events on 30 March 2011 between 9.46am and 10.21am - is what I am to take the accused to have meant when he said to Dr McClure that ""Something terrible has happened"", and why he was in such a state of high anxiety that he required medication so urgently that morning.
285I will return to consider whether I am satisfied that statement was an implied admission to the effect that he had seriously assaulted the child (although not fatally), the finding urged by the Crown.  Self evidently, were the accused's unsolicited comment to Dr McClure capable of being interpreted as a reference to an observation or realisation that the child was injured by someone else, a significant feature of the Crown case theory as presented at trial falls away. 
286My concern about the credibility of BJP, LB and RW is not simply because those witnesses were the subject of specific challenge by Ms Yehia in respect of some parts of their evidence, in particular the evidence of BJP and LB as to their dealings with and access to the child on the afternoon of 29 March and the opportunity which was afforded either or both of them to inflict the secondary injuries (or the most serious of them).  My concerns are also sourced in the attempts by all three witnesses to explain or account for the delay of over an hour before calling 000, in circumstances where, it seems to me, beyond any doubt that they must have appreciated that the child was seriously injured and in need of urgent medical assistance.  These concerns left me in doubt as to whether those three witnesses were making a genuine attempt to give completely frank and honest evidence about the critical events with which this trial was concerned.    
287Despite the fact that the summary of LB's evidence as detailed in the chronology of events I have earlier set out reads as if his evidence was given in a coherent and structured way, it is important that I record that whilst he was in the witness box he had considerable difficulty giving any detailed evidence of his involvement in the events that were the subject of this trial.  His evidence was punctuated with both complete lapses of recall and an inability to order events in time.  It was also necessary for me to afford him breaks in giving his evidence as his levels of patent stress and anxiety seemed to me to be at times dangerously elevated.  I accept a serious motorbike accident in 2006 has impacted adversely on his long-term memory.  I also accept that his ability to recall more contemporary events decreases when he is under stress.  Whatever may have triggered his stress levels in giving evidence as a witness in the trial, I could not help but note that there was a marked and telling consistency between the way he described some of the critical events and BJP's evidence concerning those same events (for example, playing the guitar on the afternoon of 29 March and jumping the fence en route to the accused's house the following morning) and a noticeable absence of any detail that may have been the product of an independent memory.  In addition, his evidence and that of BJP's that the child was only ever disciplined by a light tap of the hand (both witnesses giving the same demonstration in the witness box) had all the hallmarks of a contrivance. 
288RW also gave evidence in circumstances where it appeared to me that she was suffering under a disability related to her physical disability such as to undermine her reliability when recounting past events.  Her evidence was often vague and lacking in complete coherence.  Despite the fact that she repeatedly denied that the medication she was taking for pain relief resulted in vagueness, she also volunteered that her illness affects her brain function.  This may have affected her ability to give any sensible account of the repeated phone calls to which she must have been party on the morning of 30 March or to account for them in any meaningful way given her evidence that she insisted that her daughter call for the ambulance as a matter of extreme urgency when she first spoke with her that morning.  However, I am unable to accept that as the only explanation, or indeed the dominant explanation, for the deficiencies in her evidence.  It might have been otherwise were her daughter to have given an acceptable explanation for the delay in calling the ambulance or indeed for LB to have been able to do so.  In addition, while there might be an understandable explanation for RW to attempt to minimise the injuries she suffered at her daughter's hand on 30 January 2011 given that they have apparently reconciled, I was left with the distinct impression that there were other motivations for what I am satisfied was a deliberately untruthful account of that incident.  
289Put simply, I am unable to accept that when confronted with the telephone records showing the degree of contact between them in the hour before the ambulance was called, BJP or her mother have honestly accounted for what was being discussed between them that morning.  I consider that there is a distinct possibility that they were worried that the evidence of inflicted injuries to the child's head and her buttocks and thigh would be revealed if the child were transferred into institutional medical care consequent upon the attendance of the ambulance, and that they deliberately delayed making the call for that reason in the hope that the child would recover from what they were told was a fall without the need for medical attention and without the certain risk that the person who inflicted the injuries would be identified.
Conclusion
290In this case, the Crown relies upon circumstantial evidence to establish the guilt of the accused.  For guilt to be proved by this approach, it must not only be a rational inference drawn from the body of the circumstantial facts (and whatever direct evidence there is that forms part of the Crown case), but it must be the only rational inference that can be drawn from that evidence.
291In a circumstantial evidence case where there are multiple pieces of evidence upon which the Crown relies, either to establish facts in issue, or to support proof of those facts by necessary inference, no fact or facts by itself or themselves is sufficient to establish guilt.  Rather, it is the accumulation of evidence and the analysis of that evidence in the way contended for by the Crown that must leave no other conclusion open but that the accused is guilty or the child's murder (or manslaughter).   
292I am not obliged in undertaking that exercise to look at each fact separately, but rather to consider whether, in combination, they are of sufficient probative weight to support the ultimate inference of guilt.  (I do not regard proof of the identification of the person who inflicted the secondary injuries as an independent link in the chain of reasoning necessitating it to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  On the other hand, I am satisfied the evidence establishing that fact does need to be cogent and reliable.)
293That said, where one of the pieces of circumstantial evidence is what the Crown alleges to be a deliberate and material lie told by the accused as evidencing a consciousness of guilt of the crime charged, if there is another reasonable explanation for the accused's lie (or to put it another way, if there is (or might be) an innocent explanation for the lie that the Crown cannot discount) then the lie must be disregarded.  
294In this case, I am satisfied that the accused told police a deliberate lie as to his movements on the morning of 30 March.  I am also satisfied it was a material lie.  The question is whether there is a competing innocent explanation for it.
295The Crown submitted that the accused deliberately concealed from police his call to the doctor because he knew that inquiries of the doctor by police would expose the fact that he was in a state of high anxiety that morning because ""something terrible [had] happened"" which, on the Crown case, was his violent abuse of the child prior to his inflicting the fatal injury.  The Crown submitted that the lie then allowed the accused to lay the groundwork for constructing an accidental fall in the course of an otherwise routine morning, well knowing that he had again assaulted the child upon his return from the chemist, this time fatally.  Analysed in this way, in the Crown's submission, the link is forged between the lie and both the infliction of the secondary injuries and the infliction of the fatal assault.  
296In the course of dealing with the medical evidence bearing upon the issue of secondary injuries, I was able to reason confidently to the conclusion that the injuries to the child's ears, buttocks (and probably the thigh) and the deep bruising to her scalp were all inflicted injuries, and were the consequence of an assaultive act or acts by someone.  The medical evidence did not however allow me to find that any of those injuries were inflicted at any particular time or whether they were inflicted at the same time or at different times.  The identity of the person who inflicted those injuries loomed large in this trial.  It is however neither the primary focus of the trial nor is it the subject of the charge that the accused faces.  I caution myself against the inquiry into the identity of the person or people who inflicted the secondary injuries on the child overwhelming the question whether the Crown has proved that the accused is guilty of the child's murder. 
297Were I left in no doubt as to the credibility of the evidence of the child's mother and her boyfriend, and in particular, were I left in no doubt that it was the accused, and only the accused who had the opportunity to inflict the injuries on the child, thereby excluding any reasonable possibility that BJP or LB or both might have assaulted the child, and were I also able to accept their evidence that when they left at 5pm on 29 March the child was well in all observable respects, then logic would dictate that I would find that it was the accused who inflicted the secondary injuries given their frank presentation on her admission to hospital and that he was the only person who had access to her in the preceding 24 hours.  Were I able to reason in that way, it would also allow me to afford preponderant weight to the Crown's submission that the secondary injuries were inflicted by the accused at some time after 5pm on 29 March and before 9.45am the following morning after he lost control, perhaps only momentarily, and repeatedly struck the child (or threw or dropped her) perhaps as a consequence of the interplay of environmental, physical and emotional stressors the Crown submitted were in play, and that in a state of abject remorse he telephoned his doctor for assistance and made a telling admission in the process.
298While I do not reject the evidence of the child's mother in its entirety (or to the extent that LB gave truly independent evidence, the entirety of his evidence), I am however left in considerable doubt as to whether their version of events of the afternoon of 29 March is truthful and, by necessary extension, whether their version of events as it relates to the delay in calling the ambulance is acceptable.  It is no part of my role or function to make a finding that the child was forcefully smacked on her buttocks and about her head and ears by the child's mother or by anybody else, and I do not make that finding.  I am not however persuaded on all of the evidence to a sufficient level of satisfaction that the accused inflicted those injuries.  Unlike the child's mother, there is nothing in the evidence that is even faintly suggestive of a tendency to violence on his part.  The overwhelming weight of the evidence is that his treatment of the child is to the contrary.  Further, his exposure of the child to public view after having, on the Crown case, abused her such as to cause observable injuries is also inexplicable.  
299In contrast, the tendency evidence in the trial led by the accused does establish that the child's mother can, under stressful circumstances, lose self control to the extent of inflicting serious and sustained violence upon a vulnerable person, without apparent regard for the consequences, and then to later express regret and remorse.  Whilst there is no evidence that the child was assaulted by her mother (aside from the accused in his interviews with police to which I afford some weight), I am satisfied that the measures she took to control the child by tightly restraining her in her pram does tend to suggest that she was not, as a very young mother with an active, even hyperactive child, always able or willing to employ more benign methods of controlling her.  I note in that connection that, contrary to BJP's evidence that the child was ""hypo"" or a ""wild child"", to the observation of Dr Bedford, Ms Young and Ms Franks she was a relatively quiet child, also consistent with the accused's experience of her whilst she was in his care.  
300I emphasise that I cannot say what occurred to the child while she was in her mother's company for some hours on 29 March.  That said, the accused's observations of her on her return as subdued and possibly unwell and with a raised temperature are suggestive that something happened to the child to result in the bruising observed by medical personnel the following day.  Whatever happened might also explain Ms Maione's observations of the child as unwell.  I caution myself against affording the accused's observations of the child upon her return any undue weight given that they are untested in cross-examination.  On the other hand, the lengthy and intensely focused questions by police and the answers volunteered by the accused without accusation or insinuation are, in my view, entitled to appropriate weight in his favour.  
301Reasoning in this way, I am also prepared to conceive of the reasonable possibility that the child's condition worsened on the night of 29 March and into the early morning of the following day (or at least her condition did not stabilise or resolve to the extent that she fully recovered) such that by mid morning, with the bruising becoming apparent, the accused became concerned, even alarmed, that either he would be regarded as an irresponsible or negligent carer or, perhaps even more likely, that he knew or believed that the child's mother (his de facto stepdaughter for whom he felt considerable paternal sympathy) was responsible for harming the child and that, in an unguarded moment, when seeking to address his anxiety in that situation, he reported to Dr McClure that ""Something terrible has happened"", as reflecting that knowledge or belief. 
302I am also compelled to the view that his lies to police about his movements on the morning of 30 March might have been motivated by something other than a consciousness of his own guilt in respect of the crime charged, namely a misplaced but understandable desire on his part to protect BJP from the obvious judgment that a disclosure that she had harmed her child would involve, and that he became wedded to that lie and could not later retract it. 
303I now move to consider whether, in light of those findings depriving the Crown of any reliance upon the accused's infliction of the secondary injuries, or the lies he told to police as to his movements on 30 March as evidence in proof of the allegation that he fatally assaulted the child, the Crown has discounted the reasonable possibility that the injuries which caused the death of the child were sustained accidentally in the fall. 
304Accepting as I do for the purposes of this analysis that the accused called the child's mother at 10.21am and told her that the child had harmed herself in a fall, and that it was within minutes that she arrived to find the child unconscious, if the accused deliberately inflicted the head injury there was a very narrow time frame, measured in minutes, after he left the chemist and returned home to do so.  
305One of the factors relied upon by the Crown as undermining the plausibility of the accused's account of accident is the relative placement of the pram and the child in the reconstructed accident scene.  There was evidence from the manufacturer of the pram that the pram seized from the accused's premises was in generally poor condition, with some suggestion that the back wheels did not function in accordance with the condition of the pram at the point of initial purchase.  On the other hand, there was no evidence to suggest that the base functioning of the pram and its stability was other than sound.  No evidence was called by the Crown however, to inform the question of whether it was possible for the pram to be rendered unstable if climbed upon and, if it was rendered unstable, the likely direction it would move so as to ultimately fall on its side.  It is a notorious fact that the dynamics of a fall are difficult if not impossible to recreate, the more so when the fall is unwitnessed.  While for my part I find it difficult to conceive of how the child came to rest, or how she may have come to rest on the tiled foyer with her head generally at right angles to the door and the pram on its left side in the carpeted area of the lounge room that leads directly to the small tiled foyer, the evidence does not allow me to find that the physical laws do not allow for the possibility that the child fell backwards from the pram and struck her head.  Uninformed by the evidence, I would be at risk of speculative reasoning with all of the inherent dangers that are entailed were I to conclude otherwise.  From a different but allied perspective, while again I find it difficult to conceive of why a child in what I am satisfied must have been the compromised physical condition of the deceased child on her return from the chemist might climb onto or into the pram, to conclude against the accused that there is no rational explanation for it, attributes to a two and a half year old child a degree of rationality and predictability, which has its own inherent dangers.  
306Because the combined weight of the medical and biomechanical evidence cannot exclude the possibility that the child sustained the fatal head injury from the postulated fall from the pram, in the absence of other evidence available to the Crown to discount that as a reasonable possibility, I am compelled to the conclusion that the Crown has not disproved beyond reasonable doubt that the child's fatal injury was the result of an accident.
307There remains a complex of perplexing issues raised by the evidence in this trial, but I direct myself that it is for the Crown to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt and in this case the Crown has failed to discharge that heavy onus. 
308Accordingly, on the charge that on 1 April 2011 the accused murdered JP, I find the accused not guilty and enter that verdict.

2762684,R v Savic [2013] NSWSC 1637,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1JOHNSON J: The Offender, Daniel Savic, has pleaded guilty to the murder of Michael Goh on 29 September 2011 at Sydenham. 

2The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life: s.19A Crimes Act 1900. There is a standard non-parole period of 20 years for this crime.

Findings of Fact

3It is necessary to make findings of fact with respect to the offence. 

4The Court may not take disputed facts into account on sentence, in a way that is adverse to the interests of the Offender, unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are matters which the Offender relies upon in mitigation of penalty, it is enough if those matters are proved by the Offender on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28]. However, not all disputed issues of fact related to sentencing must be resolved for or against the Offender. There may be issues which the material available to the sentencing Judge will not permit the Court to resolve in a way that goes either to increase or to decrease the sentence to be imposed: Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 at 636-637 [19], [22].

Material Relevant to Fact Finding

5By his plea of guilty to murder, the Offender admits that he committed acts against Mr Goh, with intent to kill or (at least) intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, which caused the death of Mr Goh. 

6An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. However, there is controversy concerning certain factual matters, in particular, what happened immediately prior to the acts of the Offender which caused Mr Goh's death.

7The Offender did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. A short statement made by him was tendered in the defence case, with the statement omitting (having not been pressed after objection) parts which contained the Offender's account of the offence (Exhibit 2). 

8In addition, a report of Mr Peter Champion, psychologist, dated 9 September 2013 was tendered (Exhibit 1). In circumstances where the Offender did not give evidence, it was submitted for the Crown that no real weight could be given to the Offender's account of the offence as provided to Mr Champion, in accordance with the principles in R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 [58]-[59], 380 [79]. I will adopt this approach in considering this part of the evidence.

Some Undisputed Facts

9At the time of his death on 29 September 2011, Mr Goh was 57 years of age. He lived and worked at 9 Gleeson Avenue, Sydenham, where he operated a second-hand goods business.

10The Offender was born in 1983, and was 28 years' old at the time of the offence. The Offender and Mr Goh had known each other for a number of years and had, from time to time, engaged in consensual sexual activity with each other. 

11On the evening of 29 September 2011, the Offender attended Mr Goh's premises at Sydenham. Between 8.30 pm and 9.30 pm, the Offender attacked Mr Goh, inflicting several blunt head injuries which caused his death. Having fatally attacked Mr Goh, the Offender left the Sydenham premises.

12At about 11.30 pm that evening, Darren Hookey and Sheree Wiley, who had been at a nearby hotel, walked past Mr Goh's premises and noticed that the shop was still open. Mr Hookey called out to the owner of the shop. When he received no reply, Mr Hookey looked down the narrow passageway leading to the store and saw a person lying on the ground. He ran back to the hotel and spoke to the security guard, who accompanied Mr Hookey back to the shop. They saw a person lying on the floor. The two men reported the matter to the hotel duty manager, Sean Taylor, who attended the store. Mr Taylor found Mr Goh lying on the ground about six to seven metres from the front entrance. Mr Taylor observed what appeared to be dried blood. He called out to the person, but received no response. The television was on.

13Mr Taylor checked the body for signs of life, but found none. A ""000"" call was made at 11.37 pm, with police and ambulance officers attending as a result.

14Mr Goh was found lying in the middle of the walkway at the back of the shop near the television. His head was tilted slightly backwards. His shirt was lifted a few inches. His pants were pulled down to the top of his thighs, with the pockets of his pants pulled out. His underpants were in their normal position. The top of the underpants was visible. Mr Goh was wearing no shoes or socks, and his feet were blood spotted. A cardboard box was on the abdomen of the deceased. His right hand was covered in blood. There was blood spattered all around the deceased and on various furnishings and clothing.

15An ambulance officer checked the deceased for vital signs and found none.

16A crime scene was established.
 
Submissions Concerning Disputed Factual Issues

17The making of findings of fact will involve consideration of the Offender's admissions giving rise to his plea of guilty, inferences to be drawn from physical evidence at the scene of the crime and accounts given by the Offender to police over a period between 29 September 2011 and 21 November 2011, when the Offender ultimately admitted that he had killed Mr Goh. 

18The Offender had told lies to the police concerning events when first spoken to on 30 September 2011, and again on 2 October 2011. The Offender was arrested by police on 21 November 2011. Again, he told lies to police, falsely asserting that Mr Goh had stumbled and hit his head inside the shop. It was only after that interview was complete that the Offender told police that he was, in fact, guilty, leading to a further record of interview conducted on the evening of 21 November 2011. 

19In this interview, the Offender asserted that he and Mr Goh were engaged in consensual sexual activity when Mr Goh was said to have become aggressive towards the Offender, trying to have anal intercourse with him, with Mr Goh allegedly picking up a knife and advancing towards the Offender. The Offender told police that he had ""lost it"" at that point and a struggle ensued between the two men, culminating in a number of blows being struck by the Offender to Mr Goh's head, causing his death. 

20It was submitted for the Crown that the version of events given by the Offender ought not be accepted, given earlier lies told by the Offender to police and the fact that physical evidence was inconsistent with this account, and in circumstances where the Offender did not give evidence on sentence. 

21Mr Winch, counsel for the Offender, submitted that the Court should accept the Offender's version in this respect, and take it into account as a mitigating circumstance arising from provocation offered to the Offender by Mr Goh, from his attempt to have unwanted sexual relations with him and with the Offender thereafter acting, to some degree, in self defence: s.21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

22Counsel accepted that, in accordance with the principles in The Queen v Olbrich, the onus lay upon the Offender to establish what were said to be mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime of murder, in accordance with the Offender's final account to police. 

23To the extent that there is an issue for determination in these proceedings as to whether the Offender was acting with intent to kill or intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I accept that this is an issue upon which the Crown bears the onus to the criminal standard. 

Findings Concerning Disputed Factual Issues

24In light of the submissions advanced, I record my findings on these issues in the following way.

25The Offender was 28 years of age and 179 centimetres tall with a solid build. Mr Goh was 57 years of age, 168 cm tall and weighed 83.5 kilograms. 

26The post-mortem examination of Mr Goh conducted on 1 October 2011 revealed that he had suffered extensive blunt-force injuries to the head. These injuries included, but were not limited to:

(a) a 14 cm x 10 cm compound depressed skull fracture (also involving the left temporal bone);

(b) bilateral base of skull fractures (over both orbital roofs) and left middle and left posterior cranial fossa;

(c) fracture of the anterior aspect of the parietal bones;

(d) a fractured thyroid cartilage;

(e) a significant number of facial lacerations and lacerations to the back of the head.

27Injury patterns were indicative of blunt-force and sharp-force trauma. There were multiple cross-shaped patterned lacerations (consistent with the shape of a Phillips head screwdriver) to the face and the scalp. An examination of the skull bone also showed multiple small patterned impression marks on the bone, consistent with an impression inflicted by a large standard screwdriver or a similar item.

28Mr Goh also sustained hand injuries, including fractures to the middle and ring fingers of his left hand. There were extensive blunt-force and sharp injuries to his right hand, many involving the dorsal aspect of the right hand, being defensive type injuries. 

29Mr Goh had also sustained back injuries consisting of bruising to the left-side mid-section and fractured ninth lateral rib corresponding to the identified bruise.

30The injuries to Mr Goh support a clear finding that he was attacked to the head and other parts of the body, with different weapons being used against him. Located in the Sydenham premises after the discovery of Mr Goh's body were a number of items which were linked forensically to the murder. 

31The items included:

(a) a number of broken wooden coat racks located beside Mr Goh, and associated items (broken knobs) located under the body;

(b) a bloodstained antique-style mannequin (with hairs attached to the metal base) located near the body - I accept that these hairs had come from the deceased;

(c) bloodstained pieces of broken mirror located around Mr Goh's head;

(d) several bloodstained Phillips head and flathead screwdrivers located around the body;

(e) a pair of bloodstained pliers located near Mr Goh's right hip;

(f) a pink lamp and white pedestal fan located on top of a lounge near the body.

32Mr Goh's blood was located on the bloodstained items. 

33The bloodstained fingerprints of the Offender were located on a coat/hat stand, which was located near the body resting on a lampshade. I infer that the Offender used this item as a weapon to strike Mr Goh.

34As against the multiple and fatal injuries inflicted upon Mr Goh, the Offender was relatively unscathed. When spoken to by police on the morning of 30 September 2011, police noted that the Offender had fresh cuts to his left middle finger and his right-hand little finger. The Offender told police that his pet bird had done this to him, and he showed police his pet lorikeet in his Ashfield home.

35The Offender described to police the knife which he alleged had been wielded by Mr Goh as being ""like a Samurai sword kind of thing just a small one"". He said that he managed to get it away from Mr Goh and threw it down. Examination by police of the Sydenham premises revealed a dagger in a cupboard in the backroom of the premises, and an ornamental sword in a sheath in a shelving unit in the hallway of the premises. An ornamental sword in a sheath was located on top of some planks of wood under the mezzanine floor/storage area towards the centre of the shop, about three to five metres from where Mr Goh's body was located. The sword was dirty and rusty. 

36A search of the Offender's Ashfield premises on 4 and 5 October 2011 revealed the deceased's bloodstained hair located on a towel in the bathroom.

37The Offender's plea of guilty and the description of the injuries inflicted upon Mr Goh and the various weapons used to inflict these injuries readily demonstrate that a sustained and ferocious attack was directed by the Offender towards Mr Goh. 

38Given the variety of injuries and their gravity, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender intended to kill Mr Goh certainly at the time when the latter series of blows were struck to his head. This is not a case confined to one or two blows struck to a victim's head, which may call for a finding that the assailant possessed an intent to cause grievous bodily harm and no more. The variety of injuries, and of items used to attack Mr Goh, supports an inference to the criminal standard that the Offender intended to kill him, acting in a state of anger. 

39The Offender seeks a finding that the blows were struck to Mr Goh following a suggestion of unwanted sexual activity, which the Offender allegedly rebuffed, and then following threats by Mr Goh towards the Offender, with the deceased brandishing a knife towards the Offender. There are a number of significant difficulties standing in the way of findings of fact such as these favourable to the Offender. 

40Firstly, the Offender has not given evidence to support this account. The evidence in support of this scenario emerges from the final version given by the Offender to police, nearly two months after the crime had been committed. Prior to then, the Offender had consistently given a false account to police. In addition, the Offender provided this account to Mr Champion who repeated it in his report. However, no weight can be given to this part of the report. The strength of the account provided to Mr Champion rises no higher than the unsworn version furnished by the Offender to police, after an extended period of deceptive conduct on his part. 

41Secondly, an examination of the physical evidence provides no real support for the Offender's account. It is difficult to see how any of the items located in the Sydenham premises satisfy the description given by the Offender to police of the knife allegedly wielded by Mr Goh. The items which were located did not seem to be in locations which suggested that they played any part in the fatal incident (see [35] above).

42Thirdly, the evidence of injuries to the Offender tends to support the Crown submission, and undermine the defence submission on this issue. The Offender had a relatively minor injury to the hand, which I accept was occasioned during his attack upon Mr Goh. Of course, the Offender falsely attributed this injury to his pet bird, as part of his attempt to deceive police. 

43I accept that some triggering event occurred in the Sydenham premises on 29 September 2011, which led the Offender, in a state of anger, to murder Mr Goh. However, I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that there was any suggestion by Mr Goh of some form of unwanted sexual activity which led the Offender to act in this way. Further, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Goh threatened the Offender with a knife, as a part of the incident which culminated in the fatal attack upon Mr Goh. 

44The Court is left in the position that no reliable and precise finding can be made as to what it was that enraged the Offender, so that he attacked Mr Goh with intent to kill. It would be a matter of pure speculation, and not a process of inference, to advance possible factors which could contribute to conflict between the two men leading to the murder of Mr Goh. 

45Of the two men in the Sydenham premises at the time, only the Offender lives to provide an account as to what happened. I am not prepared to make a finding on the balance of probabilities favourable to the Offender, upon the basis of the unsatisfactory documentary evidence which the Offender points to in support of this submission. To the extent that the physical evidence tells a tale as to what happened in the Sydenham premises that evening, that evidence supports the Crown and not the Offender.

46The Offender has been in custody since his arrest on 21 November 2011. 

The Offender's Subjective Circumstances

47Material concerning the Offender's subjective circumstances can be found in his criminal history, his letter to the Court and the report of Mr Champion. 

48The Offender is now 30 years' old. He was raised in the Menai area and is the eldest of three brothers.

49The Offender informed Mr Champion that he had left school in Year 10, and thereafter had a chequered employment history including work as a storeman and packer and some casual work. 

50The Offender has a criminal history commencing in 2000. 

51Offences of violence include common assault in February 2002 ($500.00 fine), assault police in April 2002 (nine months' imprisonment), assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault (two counts) in August and September 2002 (sentences of three months and one month's imprisonment). Sentences of imprisonment in August 2003, for offences of larceny, included parole orders requiring counselling for, amongst other things, anger management. 

52There are a number of offences of dishonesty extending to April 2009, when sentences of imprisonment were imposed in the Sydney District Court for larceny and disposing of stolen property.

53The Offender's custodial history discloses disciplinary entries for fighting in 2002, 2003 and 2005. 

54Mr Winch emphasised the absence of any prison disciplinary matter involving violence in the period since 21 November 2011, when the Offender had been in custody for this offence.

55Mr Champion undertook psychometric testing, with the Offender achieving an overall score on the WASI-II scale in the bottom half of the average range. His reading skills appeared to be confident and competent for age, despite a reported history of learning problems. On the Verbal Comprehension scale, the Offender showed reasonably well-developed vocabulary knowledge skills, though he needed to be heavily structured to achieve to this level and he found the language-based abstract reasoning test difficult. On the Perceptual Reasoning scale, the Offender's results were low-mid average.

56Mr Champion observed, on the basis of the history provided by the Offender, his presentation and the result of testing, that there was no indication that he was suffering from an intellectual disability, nor a major global limitation in intelligence. 

57The Offender gave a history of polysubstance abuse and pathological gambling, and an earlier history of dysfunctional upbringing, reportedly being taken into State care as an adolescent. The Offender has had some involvement with a range of mental health services. 

58Mr Champion outlined the Offender's account of the offence, and observed that the impression was that the Offender demonstrated ""Cluster Personality disorder traits, which could have caused him to react violently in a confrontation situation (assuming the basic accuracy of Mr Savic's account), that is for instance by causing an exaggerated emotional response and inadequate control over his behaviour and tendencies to aggression and to lose control of his actions when he became enraged"". 

59A difficulty with reliance upon this part of Mr Champion's report is that I have not accepted the basic accuracy of the Offender's account. A foundation for this part of Mr Champion's opinion is compromised, although I accept that the Offender clearly became angry and directed his aggression towards Mr Goh, with fatal consequences.

60Mr Champion observed that there seemed to be antisocial features present and blunted sensibilities, which might serve to explain how an individual such as the Offender might behave in a manner which was more aggressive than might be expected of others in such a situation. However, Mr Champion expressly refrained from any diagnosis of psychopathy which went beyond the label of antisocial personality disorder (paragraph [49]).

61Mr Champion identified a number of risk factors which were relevant to prognosis. He concluded at [46]:

""In sum there are a range of factors which suggest that the risk of future violent behaviour is potentially significant, the point being that it is therefore necessary to address those risk factors, for instance by way of psychiatric/psychological treatment and involvement in violent offender programs.""
 
Offence in Breach of Conditional Liberty

62At the time of the offence of murder on 29 September 2011, the Offender was on bail with respect to a charge of using a carriage service to menace or harass a person. No evidence was offered on this charge on 8 November 2011 so that no finding of guilt resulted. 

63However, the fact that the Offender was subject to conditional liberty, in the form of a grant of bail, at the time of the murder offence operates adversely to him on sentence: s.21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [86]. Section 21A(2)(j) remains a relevant consideration even though the charge in respect of which he was on bail did not proceed: R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; 176 A Crim R 1 at 13 [64]. The fact that the charge for which the Offender was on bail was of a different type to that for which he is to be sentenced does not stand in the way of application of s.21A(2)(j): Frigiani v R [2007] NSWCCA 81 at [23]-[24].

The Offender's Plea of Guilty

64The Offender was arrested on 21 November 2011 and was, in due course, committed for trial in this Court. On 2 February 2013, the Offender was arraigned, pleaded not guilty and his trial was listed to commence on 12 August 2013. 

65On 1 August 2013, the Offender was rearraigned before me and pleaded guilty to murder.

66Mr Winch submitted that a discount ought be allowed in the order of 10%-15% for the Offender's plea. The Crown submitted that the discount should not exceed 10%. 

67The plea of guilty was late and was entered not long before the scheduled trial date. In these circumstances, I will allow a discount of 10%: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at 10-11 [32].

Victim Impact Statement

68A victim impact statement was provided to the Court from Raymond Chan, a nephew of Mr Goh, with Mr Chan writing on behalf of the entire family. Mr Chan spoke of the devastating effect upon the family, and in particular, Mr Goh's mother, arising from news of his death. Mr Chan's statement demonstrates the terrible consequences for the family arising from Mr Goh's death. 

69I express the sympathy of the Court and the community to Mr Chan, and Mr Goh's family, for their loss. I must approach the victim impact statement in accordance with legal principles applicable in this State. 

Objective Gravity of the Offence

70As the offence of murder carries a standard non-parole period of 20 years, the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 should be kept in mind on sentence. I have had regard to the provisions in ss.54A and 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as amended recently by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Non-Parole Periods) Act 2013, those amendments being intended to clarify the role of the standard non-parole period in sentencing, following the decision in Muldrock v The Queen. 

71The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of seriousness, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence: s.54A(2).

72The standard non-parole period is a guidepost to be taken into account, together with the maximum penalty, as part of the instinctive synthesis process. The standard non-parole period is to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, together with other relevant considerations: s.54B(2). The Court must record reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period: s.54B(3). However, the Court is not required to record the extent to which the seriousness of the offence differs from that of an offence to which the standard non-parole period applies: s.54B(6).

73Mr Winch submitted that the seriousness of this offence lay below the middle range of objective seriousness. The Crown submitted that the offence did not lie below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.

74In approaching these submissions, I keep in mind the caution required in view of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen, and the amendments effected to ss.54A and 54B. 

75I propose to consider the objective gravity of this offence by reference to the common law concept of objective gravity, an assessment of which is necessary for the purpose of sentence.

76I have made findings of fact earlier in these remarks concerning the circumstances of the offence itself. 

77The Offender and Mr Goh were not strangers. They knew each other well and had an association which extended to consensual sexual conduct. 

78On the evening of 29 September 2011, the two men were at Mr Goh's home at Sydenham. In circumstances which the evidence leaves unexplained, the Offender launched a ferocious attack upon Mr Goh, striking him to the head and other parts of the body with various items, causing fatal injuries. On the findings which I have made, no words or act of Mr Goh triggered such conduct in the Offender. 

79Even if it had been the case that Mr Goh had suggested a form of sexual activity which the Offender was not prepared to perform (as to which an expression of refusal would have sufficed as a response), this scenario could not assist the Offender on sentence. As it happens, I am not satisfied that is what occurred, and I am certainly not satisfied that Mr Goh made any threat towards the Offender, using a knife or otherwise. 

80One is left with a savage and sustained attack to the head by a 28-year old man upon a 57-year old victim causing death. Multiple blows were used in what may be taken to have been a terrifying experience for Mr Goh, to the extent that he remained conscious during this unrestrained attack by the Offender. 

81That the offence was committed in Mr Goh's home serves to aggravate the offence: s.21A(2)(eb) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 2009; Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210. 

82As mentioned earlier, I am satisfied that the Offender acted with an intention to kill Mr Goh. However, even if the finding did not rise above intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, I consider that this is a case where there is little difference in the moral culpability of the Offender flowing from his intention: Tran v R [2011] NSWCCA 11 at [1], [44]-[45].

83The circumstances of the offence, and the items used as weapons, suggest that it was a spontaneous and unplanned act. However, for reasons which have already been explained, my findings cannot extend beyond that on the evidence before the Court. 

84To the extent that it may assist the sentencing process, I record my conclusion that the offence lay in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.

85Although every offence of murder, by definition, is a grave crime under our law, the present offence may be rightly characterised as a serious example of such a crime although, as both the Crown and Mr Winch submitted, it was some distance from the worst case of murder. 

Remorse and Contrition

86In his letter to the Court, the Offender expressed remorse for killing Mr Goh. 

87In assessing the genuineness and the weight to be given to an expression of remorse, it is necessary to keep in mind that the Offender denied to police that he had anything to do with the death of Mr Goh for nearly two months, until his admissions were made on 21 November 2011. 

88The Offender's plea of guilty was late. Moreover, the circumstances leading to the Court being unable to make a finding concerning the circumstances in which the murder occurred, constitutes a further difficulty in making a favourable finding of remorse. 

89I accept that there has been a measure of remorse, but limited weight can be attached to this factor in the circumstances of this case.

The Offender's Mental Condition

90I have set our earlier Mr Champion's opinion with respect to the Offender's mental condition at the time of the offence. Caution is required in approaching this issue given that Mr Champion's opinion was based upon certain factual assumptions, which do not accord with my findings of fact. 

91That said, Mr Champion identified Cluster B personality disorder traits, a form of antisocial personality disorder. 

92Mr Winch submitted that the Offender's mental condition should be taken into account in his favour on sentence, in accordance with the principles in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]-[178]. 

93A difficulty with this submission is that the Offender bears the onus of proof, on the civil standard, to satisfy the Court that any of these considerations may operate in his favour on sentence. 

94I am prepared to accept that personality disorder traits could have contributed to the Offender's inadequate self-control in the context of this crime. However, a finding of antisocial personality disorder may provide little assistance to a person in the Offender's position on sentence. In R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91, Spigelman CJ observed, at [23]-[24], that some mental conditions do not attract the sentencing principle that less weight is given to general deterrence. The Chief Justice observed at [24]:

""Weight will need to be given to the protection of the public in any such case. Indeed, one would have thought that element would be of particular weight in the case of a person who was said to have what a psychiatrist may classify as an antisocial personality disorder.""

95I am not persuaded, on the evidence, that the Offender's mental condition may be called in aid, in any significant way, to mitigate sentence or to reduce the moral culpability of the Offender.

96The concepts of specific and general deterrence remain important in sentencing the Offender. 

Assessing the Offender's Risk of Reoffending and Prospects of Rehabilitation

97Courts have recognised the imprecise nature of the process which involves an assessment of an Offender's risk of reoffending, in particular where a lengthy sentence is to be imposed, so that there is no prospect of the Offender being released into the community at an early time. It has been emphasised that it is the risk (and not certainty) of reoffending which is under consideration: Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [53].

98The Court is entitled to take into account what the Offender did in committing the offence when considering the risk that he may commit violent crime again in the future: Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191 at 207-208 [64]-[69]. 

99The crime of murder in this case involves a ferocious attack by the Offender upon Mr Goh, with no finding favourable to the Offender being able to be made concerning the trigger for the offence. The sustained and multifaceted attack itself gives rise to concern with respect to the Offender's risk of violent reoffending. 

100The Offender's criminal history contains entries for offences of violence, although the offences are at the lesser end of the spectrum of gravity and occurred some years prior to this incident. The Offender's criminal history indicates that anger management has been an issue requiring attention in the past. 

101For a 28-year old man to commit such a serious crime, against this background, raises concerns with respect to the risk of violent reoffending.

102At the same time, as Mr Winch has submitted, there is no incident of violence recorded against the Offender in the prison setting, in which he has been housed for some two years.

103The Court must be guarded in assessing the long-term future of the Offender. That guarded approach does not permit a positive finding that there are good prospects of rehabilitation. However, a finding should not be made that there are poor prospects of rehabilitation. There is some prospect of rehabilitation, arising from what will be an extended period in custody as a result of this offence.
104There will be ample time for the relevant custodial authorities to make an assessment of the Offender, based upon his custodial history and efforts which may be made in custody, including the provision of such treatment as may be considered necessary and the likely involvement of the Offender in the Violent Offender Treatment Program. Mr Champion foreshadowed the appropriateness of such programs for the Offender, together with psychiatric or psychological treatment.

Determining the Appropriate Sentence

105I have referred to a range of factors to be considered on sentence. It is necessary now to undertake the process of instinctive synthesis for the purpose of passing sentence.

106The offence committed by the Offender is of substantial objective gravity. The Offender was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offence. The Offender's criminal history does not assist him on sentence, but it does not operate as a factor which aggravates sentence, in the sense recognised in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566. 

107The Offender's subjective circumstances provide limited assistance to him on sentence. A guarded assessment is appropriate concerning his prospects of rehabilitation. The sentence must reflect the need for specific and general deterrence.

108Having regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors and relevant sentencing principles, I am satisfied that an appropriate head sentence, prior to application of the 10% discount, would be one of 24 years. After allowance is made for the 10% discount, a head sentence of 21 years and six months ought be fixed. 

109Mr Winch submitted, realistically, that no finding of special circumstances should be made in this case, given the significant length of any parole period which would form part of the sentence. I am satisfied that the parole period component to be incorporated in the sentence to be passed will provide ample opportunity, by way of conditional liberty, in the event that the Offender is released to parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period to be fixed. 

110Accordingly, the sentence to be imposed will comprise a head sentence of 21 years and six months with (after some rounding), a non-parole period of 16 years and three months. The sentence will commence from 21 November 2011. 

111These remarks on sentence record my reasons for setting a non-parole period that is shorter than the standard non-parole period, in accordance with the requirements of s.54B(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

112Daniel Savic, would you please stand. 

113For the crime of murder of Michael Goh, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 16 years and three months commencing on 21 November 2011 and expiring on 20 February 2028, with a balance of term of five years and three months commencing on 21 February 2028 and expiring on 20 May 2033.

114The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 21 February 2028. 

115I am obliged to tell you of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, which applies to ""serious violence offences', including the offence of murder for which you have been sentenced. In summary, this means that the State can apply to the Supreme Court for an order that you continue to receive supervision or be held in detention at the end of your sentence, if the Court considers you would be a ""high risk offender"" who poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence. It is therefore in your interests to engage in rehabilitation opportunities that may be offered to you in the course of your sentence.

		11 November 2013",2013-11-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762685,"Director General, Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services v Glennies Creek Coal Management Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 371","Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On 4 April 2009 a coal miner died at a mine operated by the respondent, Glennies Creek Coal Management Pty Ltd. The matter now before the Court does not concern the circumstances of his death: even his name appears to be absent from the voluminous material before this Court. It concerns the refusal of the trial judge in the Industrial Court to refer a question of law relating to client legal privilege to a Full Bench.

Procedural background
2On 31 March 2011 proceedings were commenced against the respondents under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) with respect to alleged contraventions of that Act, presumably relating to the circumstances of the miner's death. (The documents commencing those proceedings are not before the Court.) As is commonplace, the proceedings were commenced only days prior to the expiration of the two year limitation period within which a prosecution was required to commence.

3The proceedings in this Court have nothing to do with the merits of the prosecution. Rather, a question was raised by the respondents as to the authority of the person who instituted prosecution, for the purposes of s 106 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. An officer who had been appointed as an inspector under the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act 2002 (NSW) was authorised to exercise functions under the Occupational Health and Safety Act with respect to a coal workplace: Occupational Health and Safety Act, s 47B. A person appointed under the Mine Health and Safety Act 2004 (NSW) is taken to have been appointed as an inspector under the Occupational Health and Safety Act: s 47A. It appears that the prosecution was commenced by a Mr Regan, whose authority depended on the operation of either s 47A or s 47B (or both). However, a question was raised as to the validity of his appointment.

4The issue was whether the Minister who had authority to make such appointments, had properly delegated that authority to the Deputy Director-General, pursuant to legislation which commenced on 23 December 2006, by delegation dated 28 December 2006. The appointment itself was apparently dated 22 December 2006, although it was not published in the Government Gazette until 12 January 2007, after the power was conferred.

5On 7 March 2012, an order was made, by consent, substituting Ms Jennifer Nash, in place of Mr Regan, as the prosecutor in the proceedings. Although the legal issue appears not to have been formulated by way of a pleading, the respondents seek to establish the state of knowledge of Ms Nash at the time at which she sought to replace Mr Regan. Their apparent purpose is to establish that she was aware of factors raising doubt as to the validity of Mr Regan's appointment, which she failed to disclose to the respondents when seeking their consent to the substitution of the prosecutor. That, it will be alleged, constituted an abuse of process, with consequences which have not been identified before this Court. On 10 July 2013 the solicitors for the respondents wrote to the Crown Solicitor's Office, for the attention of Ms Marina Rizzo, seeking information as to a number of aspects of the proceedings, including Ms Nash's state of knowledge of the difficulties in relation to the impugned appointment of Mr Regan.

6In response to that letter, Ms Rizzo replied, maintaining the position that the prosecutions were validly commenced and that Mr Regan had been validity appointed for the purposes of ss 47A and 47B of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Reliance was also sought to be placed upon s 16 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), no doubt to support the validity of the prosecutions. In the part of the letter relied upon by the respondents, Ms Rizzo acknowledged that Ms Nash had become aware of ""issues of some form"" concerning Mr Regan's appointments and that she had been a party to a telephone conversation with the principal legal officer of the Department ""about possible issues/difficulties with certain aspects of Mr Regan's appointments arising from the prosecution of Southern Colliery Maintenance Pty Ltd which was on foot at the time"". Two further statements contained in the letter were relied upon by the respondents as indicating that legal advice had been given, the substance of which had been disclosed. These were as follows:

""As a result of discussions with others in the Department and of information she was given by mid-August, Ms Nash understood and believed that there was no legal issue regarding Mr Regan's authority to commence or continue prosecutions under the OHS Act.

...

During the later part of August 2012 as a result of discussions with others in the Department and of information she was given, Ms Nash formed the view that amendment should be progressed to CMHS Act. Ms Nash's belief was that the proposed amendments were primarily directed to the functions and powers of the chief inspector and inspectors, investigators and mine safety officers under the CMHS Act itself rather than under the OHS Act.""

7The respondents issued both a summons and a notice to produce (indeed more than one of each) seeking, amongst other things, documents relating to the preparation and prosecution of the draft legislation designed to rectify any problem which may have arisen. A dispute arose in relation to a claim by the appellants that certain documents should not be disclosed on the basis of client legal privilege and public interest immunity. Even that issue is not before the Court. On 13 August 2013 the President of the Industrial Commission (Boland J) disallowed claims of privilege with respect to certain documents, giving lengthy reasons for his rulings: Nash v Glennies Creek Coal Management Pty Ltd (No 2) [2013] NSWIRComm 67 (""Judgment (No 2)""). Relevantly for present purposes, all the documents in respect of which client legal privilege was claimed were referred to in a confidential exhibit JMM-1: Judgment (No 2) at [41] and [43].

8The appellants then requested the trial judge to submit a number of questions of law to a Full Bench of the Industrial Court, being a form of interlocutory appeal against the disclosure rulings. The trial judge was required to submit any question of law ""arising at or in reference to"" the proceedings: s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), as applied to prosecutions in the Court by the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), s 196.

9The trial judge submitted six questions of law to the Full Bench, but declined to submit three other questions proposed by the applicants: Nash v Glennies Creek Coal Management Pty Ltd (No 4) [2013] NSWIRComm 80 (""Judgment (No 4)"").

10Not content with that result, the appellants commenced proceedings in this Court, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), seeking orders quashing the refusal of the trial judge to submit one particular question and an order to compel him to submit that question to a Full Bench. The question in issue was formulated in the following terms:

""Did I err in law in holding that an inference drawn from a document, that certain legal advice was given, could constitute disclosure of that legal advice for the purposes of s 122 Evidence Act and the common law relating to waiver of legal professional privilege (see judgment, paragraphs [156, 160, 165])?""

11In this Court, the appellants were anxious to concede that they were not wedded to any particular formulation of the question: it was the substance of the issue which was sought to be submitted to the Full Bench. However, the question did not clearly identify the legal issue. The form adopted, commencing ""Did I err in law in holding"", was inauspicious. It is likely to require reference to a particular finding in order to be given content. That finding will, almost inevitably, involve questions of both fact and law. However, the attempt to isolate a question of law without reference to the finding may (as in this case) lead to a proposition stated at a level of generality which is unhelpful in giving practical assistance in the circumstances of the case and may not satisfy the test in s 5AE.

12The submission that the appellants sought to advance in the present case was that waiver of client legal privilege could not occur in circumstances where the terms of the advice had not been expressly revealed in a separate document, even though the content of the advice could be inferred from statements made in that other document.

Supervisory jurisdiction of this Court
13It may be accepted that the trial judge had no discretion to decline to refer a ""question of law arising at or in reference to the proceedings"". However, whether a particular question, formulated by the appellants, was indeed a question of law and did indeed arise at or in reference to the proceedings, were matters for evaluative judgment. The appellants accepted that to obtain the relief sought in this Court, they had to demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the trial judge, in accordance with the principles established in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531.

14On one view, this case gives rise to an issue which was not directly addressed in Kirk. The privative clause to be found in s 179 of the Industrial Relations Act purports to provide an absolute bar on challenges to decisions of the Commission, however constituted. That prohibition is subject to two exclusions. One, which must be read as subject to an exception for jurisdictional error of any kind, permits review of a decision of the Full Bench of the Commission on an issue of jurisdiction. No decision of the Full Bench is involved in the present case. The second exception allows for the exercise of a right of appeal to the Full Bench conferred by the Industrial Relations Act or any other Act or law: s 179(6). 

15Appeals are dealt with in Ch 4, Pt 7 of the Industrial Relations Act. Section 196 provides for the method of appeal in respect of criminal proceedings taken before a judicial member of the Commission, by invoking the relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act.

16If there is an appeal under a provision of the Criminal Appeal Act, applied by s 196 to proceedings in the Industrial Court, it would have been appropriate for the appellants to avail themselves of that avenue of appeal, rather than invoking the jurisdiction of this Court. Furthermore, in order to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, it was necessary for the prosecutor to demonstrate that the Court was not precluded by s 179 from reviewing an interlocutory decision of a judicial member of the Commission sitting alone. There is a large question as to whether Kirk prevents a State parliament legislating to ensure that, where statutory appeals are provided, that procedure must be followed, prior to a party invoking the constitutionally protected supervisory jurisdiction of this Court.

17If satisfied that such an appeal is available, this Court should decline to exercise whatever jurisdiction it might have, without determining that question, given that there are criminal proceedings presently pending before a judicial member of the Industrial Court.

Scope of orders
18The order made by the trial judge on 13 August 2013 was in the following terms (so far as relevant):

""(2) The claims by the Department of public interest immunity and client legal privilege are disallowed in respect of any statement made in confidential Exhibits MP-A to MP-D inclusive and any statements or statements made in a document referred to in JMM-1 directed to:

(a) any alleged defect in, or the validity of, the instrument of appointment, under the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act 2002 dated 22 December 2006, published in the NSW Government Gazette No 5 of 12 January 2007 at page 102;

(b) clause 2.1 of Schedule 2 of the Petroleum (On-Shore) Amendment Bill 2013, which concerns the proposed amendment to the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act 2002 by the insertion of a new clause 25A.

(3) In respect of the documents in MP-A, MP-B, MP-C and MP-D and the documents referred to in JMM-1, the Department shall prepare a schedule or table, in date order, identifying the following:

(a) where the document contains a statement or statements referred to in Order (1) hereof:

(i) the nature of the document ...; and
(ii) an extract of the whole of the statement or statements (including relevant headings).

(4) In the alternative or in addition to Order (2) [sic] hereof, the whole of the documents may be reduced in redacted form if redaction is necessary.""

19Judgment (No 2) stated:

""[155] Ms Nash came to the view about relying on s 47A, and about the need to retrospectively validate Mr Regan's appointment, after discussions with Mr Bennett, Principal Legal Officer (which discussions concerned 'possible issues/difficulties with certain aspects of Mr Regan's appointments...' and it was likely that Mr Bennett 'said something' about the validity of Mr Regan's purported appointment as Chief Inspector on 22 December 2006) and as a result of discussions 'with others in the Department' and 'information she was given'. 

[156] The very clear inference can be made that in the process of determining what to do about the 'possible issues/difficulties with certain aspects of Mr Regan's appointments' Ms Nash received legal advice to the effect that it was open to proceed with the prosecutions of the defendants on the basis of Mr Regan's appointment as an inspector under s 47A of the OHS Act, but that the CHMS Act should be amended to retrospectively validate Mr Regan's purported appointment as Chief Inspector on 22 December 2006.

...

[165] I find that by disclosing the substance of the legal advice that led Ms Nash to conclude that:

(a) it was open to proceed with the prosecutions of the defendants on the basis of Mr Regan's appointment as an inspector of [sic] s 47A of the OHS Act, and
(b) the CMHS Act should be amended to retrospectively validate Mr Regan's purported appointment as Chief Inspector on 22 December 2006, 

there has been an implied waiver of client legal privilege.""

20In Judgment (No 4), the trial judge returned to [165] in discussing one of the proposed questions for reference to a Full Bench. He stated at [20]:

""The Department and prosecutor observed, correctly, that at [165] it was held that, as a result of 'disclosing the substance of the legal advice ...' there was 'an implied waiver of client legal privilege'. It was noted that it was not stated by me what material that waiver applied to. However, it was further noted the defendants had claimed (see [145]) that, as a result of disclosure waiver, privilege was lost in respect of 'any record in connection with' the validity of Mr Regan's appointment and the (anticipated) issue of alleged abuse of process.""

21The trial judge then noted that the defendants' claim was not limited to legal advice ""received by"" Ms Nash and that the question arose as to whether it was correct to hold that all legal advice relating to the identified issues had been waived, including advice not received by Ms Nash. The trial judge referred to earlier paragraphs in Judgment (No 2) and continued:

""[24] Perhaps I should have been clearer in Nash (No 2). My intention was to convey a finding that privilege had been waived in respect of the legal advice referred to in the 12 July 2013 letter. That is, any legal advice received by the prosecutor in connection with the validity of Mr Regan's appointment and the (anticipated) issue of alleged abuse of process. In that respect, I note Ms Nash referred to 'information she was given'. If that information was provided by a lawyer, whether Departmental or otherwise, privilege has been waived. 

[25] If there was other legal advice in connection with the validity of Mr Regan's appointment and the (anticipated) issue of alleged abuse of process, but which was not received by Ms Nash, I did not know what that advice was so I was in no position to make a ruling about whether or not privilege had been waived in respect of it.

[26] If there did exist other legal advice on the issues referred to in the 12 July 2013 letter, but which was not received by Ms Nash, I do not think it could be successfully contended that there had been partial disclosure and that the tests of inconsistency and fairness required that other legal advice to be produced (see Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66; (1999) 201 CLR 1). The other legal advice would clearly be severable. It could not be said Ms Nash was acting inconsistently with the maintenance of privilege in respect of communications she had not received.""

22The purport of [25] of Judgment (No 4) set out above is somewhat obscure. If Ms Nash did not have the advice, and its contents were therefore not disclosed in the letter, there can have been no waiver: the fact that the trial judge did not know what the advice was, was irrelevant to the question of waiver, except to the extent that it cannot have been disclosed. However, the purpose of the paragraphs was, in effect, to clarify that waiver had been inferred from the disclosures contained in the letter of 12 July 2013. The notices to produce sought documents: the letter did not in terms identify any document. The letter stated that the prosecutor had been ""a party to telephone conversations"" and had formed views as a result of ""discussions"". The one sentence to which the trial judge referred read as follows:

""During the later part of August 2012 as a result of discussions with others in the Department and of information she was given, Ms Nash formed a view that amendments should be progressed to the CMHS Act.""

23This sentence does not in terms refer to legal advice: nor does it identify any document containing legal advice. It is incapable in its terms of constituting a waiver of lawyer-client privilege in respect of a particular (unknown) document. Indeed, it is not possible to infer from this statement that any relevant document existed, let alone what were the contents of the document.

24The matter proceeded on the basis that there was a document or documents covered by the claim, which would need to be produced, although the uncertainty as to the precise scope of the trial judge's order remained.

25Three views were open. The first and narrowest is that the waiver extended only to any document recording the legal advice given by the principal legal officer in the course of a telephone conversation on or about 26 or 27 June 2012. A second view is that the waiver extended to any legal advice given in the course of discussions and through the supply of legal advice during ""discussions with others in the Department and ... information she was given by mid-August"" together with ""similar discussions and information given in the later part of August 2012"". The third view is that the waiver extended to any legal advice held by officers of the Department, relating to these issues, whether or not it was ever shown to Ms Nash. 

26The ""second question"", to which this discussion was referable, was not referred to the Full Bench. There was no challenge to that decision, no doubt because the reasoning set out above clarified, satisfactorily to the applicants, the concern sought to be raised by that question. The respondents did not dispute that their success with respect to waiver of client legal privilege was limited in the way explained by the trial judge in Judgment (No 4). Accordingly, it may not matter that the orders made in Judgment (No 2) were not corrected to reflect that understanding. Nevertheless, it would be preferable if that course were taken. For present purposes, this Court should act on the basis that the finding of waiver was limited in the manner described in the passage from Judgment (No 4) set out at [21] above. 

Identifying a question of law
27The respondents, in submissions as to whether the question involved a question of law at all, referred to the remarks in the joint reasons in Osland v Secretary, Department of Justice (Vic) [2008] HCA 37; 234 CLR 275 that ""questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree"": at [49], adopting a statement of Tamberlin J in Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd [2005] 65 IPR 442 at [26]. The Court noted that the comment was made in the context of common law principles of waiver and not by reference to s 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), which was the relevant point of reference in the present case.

28While context will be critical and questions of fact will undoubtedly arise in relation to what may constitute an ""imputed"" waiver, because it may arise in circumstances where there is no conscious intention to waive privilege the exercise is governed by legal principles. The question for the trial judge in the present case had been whether Ms Rizzo's letter disclosed ""the substance"" of any legal advice. It acknowledged that Ms Nash had had a telephone conversation with the principal legal officer and that it was ""likely"" that he said something about the relevant issues in the conversation. However, the purpose of the letter was to set out what Ms Nash ""understood and believed"" as a result, in part, of receiving legal advice.

29In Osland, the issue of waiver was said to arise in circumstances where the Minister had issued a press release with respect to the refusal of a petition for mercy, which release stated that identified senior counsel had been appointed to consider Mrs Osland's petition and had given a memorandum of joint advice which recommended that, on every ground, the petition should be denied. The press release continued:

""After carefully considering the joint advice, I have recommended to the Premier that the Governor be advised to deny the petition."" [Osland at [15].]

30By reference to principles derived from the judgment in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66; 201 CLR 1, Maxwell P, in the Victorian Court of Appeal in Osland, in reasons set out extensively in the judgment in the High Court at [35], stated:

""The evident purpose of the Attorney-General's disclosure was to inform the public that the recommendation he had made to the Governor - that the petition for mercy be denied - was based on independent legal advice, advice which recommended that each ground advanced in the petition should be rejected. ... In the language of Carnell, this was a disclosure 'for the purpose of explaining or justifying' the Attorney-General's actions. The purpose was similar to that of the disclosure in Carnell itself, where the Chief Minister wished to satisfy the relevant Member of Parliament that the ACT Government 'had acted responsibly and in accordance with legal advice'.

In my opinion, there was no inconsistency between disclosing the fact of, and the conclusions, the independent advice for that purpose, and wishing to maintain the confidentiality of the advice itself. This was not a case of a party to litigation 'deploying' a partial disclosure for forensic advantage while seeking unfairly to deny the other party an opportunity to see the full text of the privileged communication. Nor was it 'the laying open of the confidential communication to necessary scrutiny'.""

31In the course of the hearing in this Court, attention was drawn to the judgment of Rolfe J in Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 12. The case involved a proposed acquisition by Mobil Exploration and Producing Australia Pty Ltd (""Mobil"") of shares in Ampolex. Mobil had issued a Part A statement and Ampolex had responded with a Part B statement. There was an issue as to the likely outcome and effect of litigation in which Ampolex was involved, known as the ""Convertible Note litigation"", on the share price of Ampolex, which was depressed at the time Mobil launched its bid. The Part B statement read in part (p 14D):

""The views set out below have regard to the pleadings, the evidence available to Ampolex and the advice of the barristers and the solicitors engaged by Ampolex for the purposes of the litigation ...: 

(a) it is likely that Ampolex will be successful in establishing [its claim] and, if so, it is unlikely that there would be any further substantial claim against Ampolex ....""

32Rolfe J rejected the proposition that this statement constituted disclosure of the substance of the legal advice for the purposes of s 122 of the Evidence Act. He stated at 17-18:

""In my view, on a fair reading of what appears [in the passage partly set out above] in the context of all the other material in it, the words are statement of Ampolex's view of the likely outcome of the litigation and they are not a statement of either the substance or effect of the advice. Those seeking disclosure point, of course, to the fact that the view is based, inter alia, on the advice. I do not think it could be suggested that the advice did not play a part in the formation of Ampolex's view. However, the question is whether the statement of Ampolex's view, albeit based on the material to which Ampolex refers, is a disclosure of Ampolex's view or a disclosure of the material on which that view was based. ... I do not regard the statement of Ampolex's view as constituting a disclosure of the legal advice. It may be that in forming its opinion Ampolex has misconstrued or misunderstood the advice. However that may be, the statement does not rise above a statement of Ampolex's view and it does not purport to state the advice, or its substance or effect and, therefore, it does not amount to a disclosure of the advice.""

33There may be a real question as to whether the statements in Ms Rizzo's letter in the present case could constitute a waiver for the purposes of s 122 of the Evidence Act, in the light of these authorities. That could amount to a question of law, if a question asked whether it was open to the trial judge to find that there had been waiver in the circumstances of the case, or if it asked whether the trial judge had applied the correct legal principles in determining the question.

34The problem in the present case is that no such question was formulated by the appellants, either for referral to a Full Bench, or for the purposes of the application in this Court. The trial judge identified the submission made by the appellants before him in the following terms at [16]:

""[I]t was not permissible for the Court to determine what might be inferred from the document for the purposes of deciding what had been 'disclosed' by the document. The question of law raised is whether, in determining what has been 'disclosed' by a document, a court may draw inferences from the contents of that document.""

35The thrust of the submission was by no means clear. On one view, it might be thought to refer to a case of express waiver, though that was not this case. The response of the trial judge, which immediately followed at [17], was:

""I think, with respect, that contention and the proposed question itself misconstrues my finding at [156]. The 'clear inference' I made was not from the 12 July 2013 letter. That is to say, I did not infer from the letter that Ms Nash disclosed the gist of legal advice she received. If one has regard to the preceding paragraph ([155]) and the following paragraph ([157]) it is apparent that the inference I made was that having had discussions with Mr Bennett, Principal Legal Officer, and 'others in the Department', and 'information she was given' Ms Nash received legal advice. The substance of the legal advice was plain from the terms of the letter: see, for example [126], [160] and [165] of Nash (No 2).""

36There did not seem to be any suggestion that Ms Nash had disclosed the legal advice she received, although the trial judge separately found that Ms Nash had given instructions to Ms Rizzo to write the letter in terms which were ""inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege claimed was intended to protect"": at [160]. The next proposition, that Ms Nash had received legal advice, was not in dispute. The final proposition that the substance of the advice was ""plain from the terms of the letter"", as opposed to being a ""very clear inference"", may have been a proposition which was not reasonably open, but that was not the distinction to which the appellants' question was directed. (It may also be that the trial judge misread his own reasons at [156], by effectively ending the first sentence after ""Ms Nash received legal advice"", thereby suggesting that the ""very clear inference"" did not, as otherwise appeared from the syntax, extend to the terms which followed, namely the effect of the advice.)

37It is possible, although the submissions were not clearly expressed in these terms, that the appellants' question was designed to draw a distinction between the view, belief or understanding expressed in the document and the opinion contained in the legal advice. As explained by Rolfe J in Ampolex, there is a significant difference between a person's statement of his or her beliefs, said to be based upon legal advice, and a statement of the content of the advice. The person may have misunderstood or mistaken the advice; or other material relied upon may have led to a belief which only partly accepted the advice, or indeed rejected it. Given such possibilities, it might be arguable that no inference could reasonably be drawn as to the substance of the advice having been disclosed in that communication, unless the person had access to the actual advice given. 

38Further, as revealed by the circumstances outlined in Osland, it may be far more difficult to infer the substance of the advice where the result is the rejection of a claim by a third party, rather than an affirmative step taken by the recipient of the advice. Indeed, the very fact that the statement was made in response to a demand by the other party is likely to be a significant factor in support of the conclusion that a limited disclosure had been made in circumstances which are not ""inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence"": s 122(2). The proposition that it would in some way be ""unfair"" to deprive the respondents of access to legal advice, just because they had asked for it, in order no doubt to contradict other information with respect to the opinions held by Ms Nash, may itself not have been a reasonable opinion available in the circumstances.

39The purpose of this examination is not to seek to identify a course which could have been taken, but to explain why the question as formulated by the appellants did not clearly identify any possibly available question of law. The proceedings in this Court must fail for that reason. 

Other matters
40Even if the appellants had succeeded in their contention that the question which the trial judge refused to refer did indeed involve a ""question of law arising at or in reference to the proceedings"", they would have faced other difficulties. First, on their own concession, it was necessary to identify jurisdictional error in order to obtain relief in this Court. It is, of course, not fruitful to consider whether a question which did not itself raise a question of law could demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the trial judge in failing to submit it to the Full Bench.

41Secondly, it was necessary for the appellants to demonstrate why, if there had been legal error on the part of the trial judge, that warranted the intervention of this Court. It would require the conclusion that the privative clause did not operate to oblige the appellants to pursue their remedies before a Full Bench. On the assumption that a relevant question of law had been identified and not submitted to the Full Bench, in circumstances which might otherwise give rise to a complaint of jurisdictional error, there would seem to be a question of law which could itself be submitted to the Full Bench pursuant to s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act, and which, on the motion of the appellants, had to be submitted.

42Thirdly, if such relief were available, it would be almost inevitable that, in the discretion of the Court, relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act would be refused. Such an outcome is at least highly likely in circumstances where, as in the present case, the respondents conceded that an appropriately worded question of law could have been, and might even now be, submitted to the Full Bench.

43Finally, it is necessary to reject the relevance of the proposition, apparently raised below and repeated in this Court, that the appellants were 'not wedded' to the terms in which the question was presented. The obligation enlivened by s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act, which required that a question of law arising at or in reference to the proceedings be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal if requested ""by the Crown"" (which includes the prosecutor in the present case) contemplates a request in relation to a particular question of law. That is not to say that the judge has no role to play in the process of formulating or refining the question, but unless some obvious and straightforward reformulation or refinement is apparent and sought in terms, it is not open to the prosecutor to come to this Court and suggest that some other question might appropriately have been submitted. The respondents properly drew attention to the statement in the judgment of the Court, delivered by Jordan CJ, in Re Van Der Lubbe (1949) 49 SR(NSW) 309 at 312 that ""[i]t is not proper to ask whether, as a matter of law, the Chairman, on the facts found by him, was entitled to find the appellant guilty of the offence charged, leaving the Court of Criminal Appeal to grope through the case stated and try to discover for itself what are the specific questions of law involved"". While the present case did not involve such an extreme dereliction, once the particular question relied upon by the appellants was found to have been properly rejected, the result was similar.

Conclusion
44The amended summons filed by the applicants must be dismissed. No reason was suggested why costs should not follow the event; accordingly, the appellants must pay the respondents' costs in this Court.

45WARD JA: I agree with Basten JA. 

46SACKVILLE AJA: I agree with Basten JA.

		08 November 2013",2013-11-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2762687,SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the orders which he proposes. I also agree with Johnson J that even had Muldrock error been demonstrated, no lesser sentence would be warranted in the case taking into account the further evidence upon which the Applicant relied in this Court.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, SW, seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the District Court on 25 November 2010. Because the Applicant's offence was committed in a small country town so that publication of his name would tend to identify the victim, a non-publication order was made concerning the names of the Applicant and the victim in the District Court. It is appropriate that the judgment in this Court use initials to describe the Applicant.

The Offence and Sentence

3The Applicant pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years contrary to s.66A Crimes Act 1900. The offence was committed between January 2007 and February 2009, when the victim was aged five or six years.

4The maximum penalty for an offence under s.66A is imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 15 years attaches to this offence. 

5On 25 November 2010, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years commencing on 31 October 2010 and expiring on 30 October 2015, with a balance of term of two years and seven months commencing on 31 October 2015 and expiring on 30 May 2018. 

The Present Application

6On 3 December 2010, a Notice of Intention to Appeal against sentence was filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 31 August 2011, the Applicant was refused legal aid for the purpose of an appeal as it was not considered that he had reasonable prospects of success in accordance with the legal aid merit test.

7Accordingly, the Notice of Intention to Appeal lapsed. 

8Following the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""), handed down on 5 October 2011, the Applicant's case (together with others) was assessed within Legal Aid NSW to determine whether there were grounds to appeal in light of the decision in Muldrock.

9On 10 July 2013, a Notice of Application for Extension of Time to seek leave to appeal against sentence was filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Applicant seeks to rely upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a)Ground 1 - her Honour erred in her application of the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock.

(b)Ground 2 - her Honour erred in her assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.

(c)Ground 3 - her Honour erred in finding that the age of the complainant was a ""highly aggravating factor"".

(d)Ground 4 - her Honour erred in finding that the offence was committed for sexual gratification.

(e)Ground 5 - (abandoned).

(f)Ground 6 - the sentence is manifestly excessive.

10The concept of Muldrock error (asserted in Ground 1) was referred to in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19]-[28]. What is said there will assist an understanding of some of the issues raised in this application.

11In Abdul v R at [42]-[53], the Court referred to principles where application is made for extension of time to appeal against sentence. Those principles will be applied in determining the present application.

12Reference was made in Abdul v R at [51] to the fact that the prospect of sentence being reopened long after the event may impact adversely upon victims of crime, particularly where the crime involves sexual violation of the victim. This factor is a significant one in this case as well, where a very young child was the victim of a sexual offence with grave and long-lasting consequences for the victim. The High Court of Australia has noted recently that the role of the criminal law includes ""the long-standing obligation of the state to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence, to express the community's disapproval of that offending, and to afford such protection as can be afforded by the state to the vulnerable against repetition of violence"": Munda v State of Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 87 ALJR 1035 at 1045 [54]. Considerations of this type are pertinent when application is made long out of time to reopen the question of sentence for crimes of violence, including sexual assault.

Facts of the Offence

13An Agreed Statement of Facts was placed before the sentencing court.

14The victim, born in December 2001, lived with his parents in a country town in New South Wales. The Applicant (born in August 1955) had been a schoolteacher at the school attended by the victim's mother. Later in life, the victim's parents befriended the Applicant, who would attend their home on many occasions. 

15From about January 2007, the Applicant (then aged 51 years) began spending time alone with the victim (then aged five years). There were times when the victim stayed overnight with the Applicant in 2007. The victim's mother suffered from epilepsy and the father suffered health issues as well in late 2007, so that the Applicant assisted the victim's family to a considerable degree at this time. 

16In late 2007, the Applicant's contact with the victim increased. The victim resided with the Applicant on frequent occasions. The association between the Applicant and the victim was encouraged by the victim's parents as they were forming the view that the Applicant may be a guardian for the victim due to their own increased health difficulties. 

17The association between the victim's family and the Applicant ended in February 2008, in circumstances where the victim's father considered that the Applicant was being overly controlling in his approach to the victim's family. 

18In June 2008, the victim made disclosure to his parents concerning the Applicant. The victim told his mother, ""Uncle [S] put a thermometer up my bottom"". In answer to an enquiry by the mother as to why the Applicant would do that, the victim replied, ""It's to make me poo better"". Complaint was then made by the parents to the victim's teacher, and then to police on 26 June 2008. 

19The next day, a Joint Investigation Response Team attended the school and spoke to the victim. The boy explained that, on the occasion in question, the victim and the Applicant were in the bathroom, with the victim in the bath. The Applicant said to the victim, ""I think I need to put the squirty thing in your bum"". The Applicant placed a tube into the anus of the victim and squirted water. The victim described ""the squirty thing"" as being red and black in colour. The Applicant possessed a rectal syringe which fitted this description.

20The victim told police that ""he stuck it up my bum all the way up my bum hole and squirted it and water came out"". The victim stated that it ""hurt a lot"", and that he did not like it. The victim said that he went to the toilet, which was located in the bathroom. The victim said to the Applicant, ""Don't do that again"" and the Applicant replied, ""I'm not"".

21After the incident, the victim went to bed to watch a movie and had to lie on his stomach as he was sore and his bottom hurt. The victim's parents informed police that the victim had never suffered from constipation.

22On 3 July 2008, police attended the Applicant's home and informed him that he was under arrest for sexual assault. The Applicant consented to a search of his premises and the police located in the bathroom a black and red coloured rectal syringe. The Applicant was asked if he had used the syringe upon anyone else and he replied, ""[The victim] has used it"".

23When taken to the police station, the Applicant declined an interview, but did state that the victim had used the rectal syringe numerous times in the bath to blow bubbles ""to make him fart"". However, the Applicant denied using the rectal syringe upon the victim.

The Sentencing Proceedings in the District Court

24The Applicant was committed for trial from the Local Court on 17 June 2010. On 17 July 2010, he entered a plea of guilty to the s.66A offence referred to above. 

25A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. Also tendered by the Crown was a report dated 24 August 2010 from sexual assault counsellors attached to the relevant Area Health Service concerning the impact of the offence upon the victim. A report of Ms Katherine Wakely, psychologist, dated 10 August 2010 was tendered in the Applicant's case.

26The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings. 

27The subjective material relied upon on sentence was drawn from the psychological report of Ms Wakely. Her Honour recounted aspects of that report in the following way (ROS5-6):

""From the history contained in the report the offender came from a stable environment and reported a close relationship with his parents and siblings. He was not the victim of neglect nor physical abuse. He did not witness alcohol or drug abuse within the family home.

He trained as a teacher at the [XXX] and he holds a variety of other qualifications. He worked mostly as a primary school teacher but eventually resigned due to continuing ill health. He described having poor control and being irritable and belligerent which he put down to poor health.

He performed casual security work before operating his own security business for seven years. He ceased operating that business in 2007 because of the adverse impact running a business was having upon his health.

In 2009 he was employed as a delivery driver but his employment was terminated when the contract expired. At the time of his arrest he was in receipt of a pension. He suffers from diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesteremia and osteoarthritis and he is prescribed a variety of medications. He apparently also suffers from diverticulitis. He does not abuse drugs or alcohol. He has no prior criminal convictions.

On the opinion of the psychologist the offender has had difficulty coming to terms with the offence he has committed. He denies interest in child pornography and denied any aberrant sexual arousal involving children. He expressed a willingness to engage in a program to treat child sex offenders. He has been placed in the medium to high range for sexual re-offending.

In the opinion of Ms Wakely the offender requires admission to a treatment program aimed at addressing sexual offending such as the Deniers Program which is an adaptation of the CORE program, that program is based at the MSPC at Long Bay Correctional Centre and is offered in a group format over a five month period. Participants attend treatment twice weekly. Strict monitoring by Probation and Parole is recommended post release together with the attendance at a community based maintenance treatment program for child sex offenders.""

28Ms Wakely observed that underlying personality constructs, such as the Applicant's concern with maintaining relationships and the high regard he has for the opinions of others, were likely to contribute to the difficulty he had in coming to terms with the offence to which he had pleaded guilty. Ms Wakely observed that denial and minimisation were extremely common in sexual offenders, and in particular in sexual offenders of child victims, with both being prominent features which allow offenders to justify their actions and help them to overcome internal and external inhibitions. However, Dr Wakely observed that denial and minimisation of offending behaviour may decrease in the context of appropriate treatment. With regard to the offence, Ms Wakely reported the Applicant as having ""an overall feeling of being 'disappointed that this has happened'"", with the Applicant having ""come to terms with the prospect of serving a custodial sentence and being placed upon the sexual offenders register"". 

29The Applicant's counsel in the District Court provided a written submission which stated that the ""offending behaviour was both aimed at assisting the complainant with toileting and with granting the offender sexual gratification"". On the question of assessment of objective seriousness, counsel then appearing for the Applicant submitted that, in this case, ""the offending behaviour was explained to the child as being for a non-sexual purpose"". In the course of oral submissions on sentence, the Applicant's then counsel submitted that the use of the instrument involved ""an element of helping the child and ... an element of sexual gratification"" and that this was ""acknowledged by the plea of guilty"" (T6, 4 November 2010).

30The sentencing Judge referred to the report of the sexual assault counsellors and found that the victim suffered ""very substantial ongoing emotional harm"" and that ""the impact on his young life has been profound"". The sentencing Judge expanded further upon this evidence (ROS6-7):

""This little boy was only five or six when he was sexually assaulted by the insertion of an implement into his anus by a trusted family friend. He felt physical discomfort after the incident, however, he has clearly suffered substantial ongoing emotional harm. He has been undertaking counselling which commenced on 2 October 2008 and was continuing in August 2010. He suffers from flashbacks and dreams. He has become socially withdrawn. He demonstrates intense arousal, anxiety, hyper-vigilance and startled responses. There has been a decline in his ability at school. He now suffers from encopresis and is displaying inappropriate sexualised behaviour. He will continue to need ongoing therapy and support."" 

Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge

31Having regard to the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to refer to some specific findings of the sentencing Judge.

32Her Honour observed (appropriately) that offences of this type are considered to be of the utmost seriousness, as demonstrated by the maximum penalty and the applicable standard non-parole period. 

33The sentencing Judge touched upon the Applicant's absence of criminal history and the significance of his breach of trust in the following way, in a manner not challenged in this Court (ROS7):

""As I mentioned earlier, the offender has no prior criminal antecedents. That is not a matter which entitles this offender to much by way of leniency. In the normal course it would entitle him to no leniency whatsoever because these types of offences are often committed by persons of otherwise good character. It is that otherwise good character that allows access to a child and minimises the risk of detection. Sadly, all too often, persons of otherwise good character hide behind that good character confident in the knowledge that if a child makes a disclosure it is more probable than not that the child would not be believed.

Here, there was clearly a breach of trust by this offender. This young child was left in his care with a view to a relationship being established between the two so that in the event of the parents being unable to care for the child the offender would become that child's guardian.""

34The following passage gives rise to Ground 4 (complaint concerning the finding of sexual gratification) (ROS7):

""The sexual assault took place in the home of the offender, somewhere where the child had resided on many occasions. Somewhere where he was entitled to feel safe and free from defilement by this offender. Somewhere where his parents considered him also to be safe. I find it was an offence committed for sexual gratification. There can be no other reason. There is simply no other explanation for why the offender behaved in this manner. Clearly on the evidence before me the child was not suffering from any condition which required an insertion of an instrument such as this into his anus.""

35A 15% discount was allowed for the Applicant's plea of guilty, a finding not challenged in this Court.

36The sentencing Judge addressed the seriousness of the offence in the following way (ROS8-9):

""The offence is one, which as I have said, attracts a standard non parole period. It is appropriate, therefore to assess the seriousness of the offending behaviour by the offender. It was an isolated incident of brief duration, but as I said earlier on a very young boy in the care of the offender and at a place where the child had stayed on many occasions and ought to have been safe.
The child was physically hurt and he told the offender to stop doing what he was doing and that he did not like it. It was obviously an act which went on for long enough and to a depth to such an extent as to cause the young boy immediate pain and discomfort which lasted for some time afterwards, that is the significance of the act of penetration. Not the length of time over which it occurred.

Like many sexual assaults upon young children this appears to have been an opportunistic incident, lacking any preplanning or premeditation. There were no threats or violence involved. It would appear that the offender used his natural authority over the child as a person standing in loco parentis in order for the child to be compliant so that he could insert the syringe into the child's anus on the pretext of it being for a medical purpose.

It was not as serious as an act of penile anal penetration of a very young child. I say that being fully aware that the type of penetration is simply one factor to be taken into account and does not by itself indicate how serious a particular offence may be.""

37Her Honour considered the age of the victim, in a manner giving rise to Ground 3 (ROS9):

""The age of the child is another factor to be taken into account, the younger the child, the more serious the offence simply because very young children are unable to report what has happened or to understand. The fact that this child was well short of ten years of age is a highly aggravating factor.

Also of significance is the very substantial ongoing emotional harm suffered by the boy to which I have referred. Clearly the impact on his young life has been profound.""

38The sentencing Judge concluded the remarks on sentence in the following way (ROS9-10):

""This is not an offender, however, who is being sentenced for a pattern of history of abuse upon the child. Often such a history is a typical feature of offences committed under s 66A and would certainly result in the finding that such offending behaviour falls within the mid range envisaged by the legislature. For all those reasons I find it is an offence falling somewhere below the mid range of an offence against s 66A. The fact that it is an isolated incident and a plea of guilty entered is sufficient to warrant a departure from that standard non parole period, of course, that does not mean that the standard non parole period does not apply. It remains relevant as a benchmark or guidepost to be taken into account.

The offender will no doubt spend his time on protection. He is not a young man and he is in poor health. Prison will be more onerous for him and that is a factor I have taken into account. I have had regard to the objective circumstances and the subjective circumstances which I have set out. Only a sentence of imprisonment will satisfy the requirements of general deterrence, to which I have referred, and that is because not only must this offender be deterred but so too must others who might be of a like mind. A message must be sent to the community that those who choose to defile innocent young children will be severely punished, not only to deter them but to deter others who might be of a like mind, as I have just said.""

39A finding of special circumstances was made as there was ""a need for a lengthier than normal period of supervised parole to ensure attendance at [an] appropriate program to minimise the risk of relapse post release"" (ROS10).

Merits of the Grounds of Appeal

40Given the nature of the application to extend time, it is appropriate to consider the grounds of appeal in a summary fashion: Abdul v R at [53]. Substantial written submissions were placed before the Court, supplemented by oral submissions at the hearing of the application. It is not necessary to recite the submissions in this judgment.

41The application for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal was filed on 10 July 2013, some two years and seven months after sentence was passed. The evidence before the Court points to the decision in Muldrock as being the true reason for the bringing of this application. To the extent that Grounds 2, 3, 4 and 6 were available to the Applicant without the decision in Muldrock, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why those grounds were not advanced at an earlier time. 

42In support of Ground 1, the Applicant submits that her Honour erred by adopting a two-stage approach to sentence and by giving determinative weight to the standard non-parole period, contrary to the principles in Muldrock. The Crown contends that no Muldrock error is demonstrated in this case.

43I have set out earlier substantial extracts from the remarks on sentence. In determining whether Muldrock error has been demonstrated, it is necessary to fairly read the remarks on sentence in their entirety.

44I am not persuaded that Muldrock error has been demonstrated in this case. The sentencing Judge had regard to objective and subjective factors, before turning to the imposition of sentence itself. Section 54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires the sentencing Judge to identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the Judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed: Muldrock at 132 [29]. The sentencing Judge did just this, before observing, correctly, that the standard non-parole period remained relevant as a benchmark or guidepost to be taken into account: Muldrock at 132 [27]. Her Honour's use of the phrase ""sufficient to warrant a departure from that standard non-parole period"" needs to be read in the context of the remarks on sentence as a whole, including the structure and content of those remarks.

45The Applicant has not demonstrated that the sentencing Judge engaged in an impermissible two-stage approach. Further, it is difficult to see how the standard non-parole period (15 years) has been accorded determinative weight given the imposition in this case of a non-parole period of five years. Ground 1 ought be rejected.

46Grounds 2, 3 and 4 each complain, in various ways, concerning the sentencing Judge's assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. The grounds may be considered together and briefly.

47The Applicant (then aged 51 years) occupied a position of trust which allowed him access to the victim (a boy aged five or six years). A significant feature of this case is that it involved a very young victim, of an age well removed from the age limit of 10 years which demarcates a s.66A offence: RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235; 216 A Crim R 489 at 519 [147]. The age of the victim, far removed from the statutory ceiling of 10 years, may be described aptly as a highly aggravating factor. There is no merit in Ground 3. 

48Submissions were made in support of Grounds 2 and 4 which focused upon the act of the Applicant which constituted the offence. Comparison was sought to be made with other forms of sexual intercourse which fall within the definition in s.61H Crimes Act 1900. Ground 4 sought to challenge the finding of the sentencing Judge that the offence was committed for sexual gratification. 

49The act of sexual intercourse inflicted upon the child victim involved the use by the Applicant of a rectal syringe under the guise of some process intended to assist the child. The victim's parents stated that the child had no difficulty with constipation, so that no valid reason existed for the Applicant to act in this way. The fact that the Applicant told the child that this was the reason for the act of abuse does not assist the Applicant. The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. When spoken to by the police following his arrest, the Applicant denied using the rectal syringe upon the victim at all. The Applicant's account provided to Ms Wakely, the psychologist, appears to have been approached by the psychologist as involving a form of minimisation of responsibility, a phenomenon well known with child sex offenders. 

50Counsel appearing for the Applicant at first instance submitted in writing and orally that the Applicant was motivated by sexual gratification in the commission of the offence. To the extent that the submissions advanced by different counsel in this Court involve a movement away from submissions made at first instance, this Court should bear in mind the approach to such circumstances set out in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 477-478 [79]-[82]. 

51This offence involved a significant act of violation of a young child, in circumstances where the victim complained immediately of the pain caused and his concern as to what had happened. Further, the victim impact material before the sentencing Judge, which included a detailed expert report, emphasised the grave and long-lasting consequences for this victim arising from this offence. To the extent that a submission was advanced in this Court that some of the difficulties experienced by the victim may possibly be explained by matters apart from the Applicant's offence, it should be observed that no such argument was advanced at first instance: Zreika v R at 477-478 [79]-[82]. The evidence at first instance did not suggest any other explanation and there is no other evidence before this Court which bears upon this issue.

52Sexual abuse of children of very tender years will inevitably give rise to psychological damage emanating from (at least) the confusion in the young mind of the victim of abuse. As RR v R at 519 [147] exemplifies, a single act of sexual abuse may have a substantial impact upon the psychological state of a young victim, with the likelihood of long-term adverse consequences. In this case, the very young victim has sustained significant adverse psychological consequences which may be traced back to the Applicant's crime. 

53The fact that the offence in this case was perpetrated by the use of an item such as a rectal syringe does not indicate that a lesser finding of objective gravity is appropriate than that reached by the sentencing Judge. The circumstances of this case are far removed from those in Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11, where the offender was not motivated at all by a desire for sexual gratification.

54In my view, there is no merit in the complaint concerning the sentencing Judge's discretionary assessment of objective gravity (Ground 2) and in the particular respects complained of in Grounds 3 and 4.

55Ground 6 contends that the sentence is manifestly excessive. It is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. The assessment contained so far in these reasons indicates the seriousness of the offence. The sentencing Judge gave appropriate weight to the Applicant's prior good character and his subjective circumstances. The maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are significant legislative guideposts to which the sentencing Judge had regard. It has not been demonstrated that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
 
Conclusion Concerning Extension of Time

56The grounds of appeal relied upon by the Applicant lack merit. Application is made long out of time to bring this application for leave to appeal against sentence. The real explanation for the delay is the decision in Muldrock. No satisfactory explanation has been provided for the substantial delay in advancing other grounds of appeal. 

57In circumstances where error has not been demonstrated, the Court does not reach the point where consideration of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is required. I record my view, in any event, that no lesser sentence would be warranted in this case, taking into account the further evidence upon which the Applicant relies in this Court.

58I propose that the application for an extension of time to bring a sentence appeal should be refused. 

59BELLEW J: I agree with Johnson J.

		08 November 2013",2013-11-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762691,Iskandar v R [2013] NSWCCA 256,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  After a 13 day jury trial in June 2012, the appellant was convicted of murdering Mr Mohd Shah Saemin at Leichhardt in Sydney on 21 February 2010.  The appellant had pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.  He claimed that he had acted under provocation.
2He appeals against his conviction, on the following grounds:
""1. The Trial Judge failed to direct the jury in accordance with the [Criminal Trial Courts] Bench Book direction where the appellant gave exculpatory evidence relevant to a critical element in the Crown case, that is, the provocation by the deceased.
2. The Trial Judge erred in directing the jury that there is 'another equally open inference' when directing the jury about an alternate inference available on the evidence"".
THE CROWN CASE
3The Crown's case at the trial was to the following effect.
4The appellant and his wife were born in Indonesia and have one child, Andrew, who was born in 1990.  During 2009, the appellant came to believe that his wife was having an inappropriate relationship with the deceased who was one of her work colleagues.  The appellant confronted them both but they denied that they were having an affair.  The relationship between the appellant and his wife nevertheless broke down. 
5The appellant rented a car and he and his son commenced to spy on the appellant's wife and the deceased.  
6The Crown alleged that the appellant and his son formulated a plan to attack the deceased on the night of 21 February 2010 and that they took various preparatory steps to that end.  When they encountered the deceased that night in Leichhardt, they attacked and killed him.
7In a police record of interview, the appellant said he had been persuaded to kill the deceased by a stranger whom he had met in a restaurant and to whom he had told his story.  After the killing, the appellant told one friend that he had ""lost control"" and another that he had attacked the deceased for ""the dignity of my family"".  He did not assert in his police interview or to any of his three friends who gave evidence that he had lost control as a result of the deceased saying offensive words to him immediately prior to the attack.  
THE DEFENCE CASE
8The appellant gave evidence that he decided to confront the deceased and ""speak seriously"" with him.  On the evening of Sunday 21 February 2010, he and his son waited in Leichhardt in the rented car, watching for the deceased.  When the appellant saw the deceased's car, he drove his car to hit the rear of that of the deceased.
9When the deceased got out of his car and recognised the appellant, a verbal altercation took place, during which the deceased told the appellant that ""you can't look after your woman"", and called him a ""poofter"" and a ""betima"" which is an insulting word in the Malay language in which the deceased partly spoke.  
10The appellant said that these statements caused him to lose control and to attack and kill the deceased.
11The appellant's case at trial was that this conduct of the deceased, when seen against the background of the deceased's allegedly improper relationship with the appellant's wife and their denial of that relationship, constituted provocation which led the appellant to kill the deceased and entitled the appellant to a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder (see s 23(1) Crimes Act 1900).
APPEAL GROUND 1:  ABSENCE OF DIRECTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH LIBERATO v THE QUEEN 159 CLR 507 AS SET OUT IN THE BENCH BOOK
12The appellant contended that the trial judge should have given a direction in accordance with the observations of Brennan J in Liberato v The Queen [1985] HCA 66; 159 CLR 507 at 515, adapted to the circumstances of the present case.
13Liberato was a decision of the High Court on an application for special leave to appeal.  At the trial, there had been a conflict between the evidence of the complainant, MK, and that of the accused.  In the course of his summing-up the trial judge had said:
""The case may well be one as I have put to you before, where the real question is who do you believe on the whole of the evidence [M.K.] or the accused?"" (at 515).
14The majority of the High Court favoured dismissal of the application and did not comment on the point presently at issue.  In dissent, Brennan J (with whom Deane J agreed) said (at 515):
""The jury must be told that, even if they do not positively believe the evidence for the defence, they cannot find an issue against the accused contrary to that evidence if that evidence gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to that issue"".
15The Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales gives at [3-620] a suggested direction, based upon Brennan J's observations in Liberato, applicable ""where the accused gives or calls exculpatory evidence relevant to a critical element in the Crown case"".  That direction is in part as follows:
""If, after having given consideration to the evidence of the accused [and/or evidence on the accused's behalf] and any evidence which the Crown asks you to take into consideration, you do not positively accept the evidence of [identify the relevant evidence] in support of the accused's case, but that evidence leaves you nevertheless with a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown has made out its case in respect of any essential matter which it must prove, then you are bound, in law, to bring in a verdict of 'not guilty'.  In other words, it is not the position that you have to believe that the accused [and/or his/her witnesses] [is/are] telling the truth before the accused is entitled to be acquitted.  As I have previously emphasised to you throughout the whole of this case, it remains the position that the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt the charge which it brings against the accused, and it is never for the accused to prove that he or she is not guilty"".
16On the appeal, the appellant recognised that this suggested direction, even if otherwise appropriate, required adaptation for use in the present case to reflect the fact that the appellant's evidence was not directed to wholly defeating the Crown's case but to resisting the Crown's attempt to negative, beyond reasonable doubt, the appellant's assertion that he acted under provocation.  
17The trial judge gave conventional directions to the jury concerning the elements of the offences of murder and manslaughter, and the burden of proof.  The appellant makes no complaint about these.  The written directions indicated that the jury could return a verdict of manslaughter if it found that the Crown had failed to negative provocation and identified one of the two questions to be answered by the jury concerning provocation as:
""May the deceased's conduct, that is, the things he did or said, or both, have induced (that is, caused) the accused to lose his self-control?""
18They then informed the jury that if it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the answer to that question was ""no"" then the Crown had negatived provocation.
19In his summing-up, the trial judge emphasised more than once the need for the Crown to prove each element of the offences beyond reasonable doubt and that it was for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not act under provocation.  He referred to the appellant's evidence of provocation and said:
""If the accused's version of what happened when he collided with the car is possibly true, then you have to consider whether he acted under provocation.
...
There must be a possibility that the provocation actually caused the accused to lose his self-control and kill the deceased while deprived of that self-control"" (emphasis added).
20In dealing with the defence of provocation, his Honour referred on at least three further occasions to the issue being whether there was a reasonable ""possibility"" that the appellant lost his self-control by reason of words spoken to him by the deceased.
21The effect of the appellant's submissions in support of this ground of appeal is that the jury would, or may, have been under the misapprehension that if it did not accept the appellant's evidence about what the deceased said, the appellant's defence of provocation failed, whereas in fact it should have been aware that non-acceptance of that evidence would have still required the jury to consider whether the Crown had negatived provocation beyond reasonable doubt.
22I do not accept that the jury could have been under any such misapprehension.  The trial judge made it plain to the jury that it needed, not only to consider whether the appellant's evidence should or should not be accepted, but whether it considered the accused's evidence as possibly true.  As the trial judge expressly stated, if the jury considered that evidence to be possibly true, it then had to consider whether the appellant acted under provocation.  The trial judge made it clear both orally and in writing that, when considering whether the appellant acted under provocation, the Crown bore the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that he did not.  
23This was not a case in which there was a conflict between the evidence of a principal Crown witness and that of the accused where the trial judge directed the jury that the issue for it was which to believe.  It is an error to give such a direction (Douglass v The Queen [2012] HCA 34; 86 ALJR 1086 at [12] - [13]).  As Liberato indicates, it should be made clear that even if the jury prefers the evidence of the Crown witness, it should not convict unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence.
24In the present case, there was no conflict between the evidence of a principal Crown witness and that of the appellant, and the only evidence capable of supporting a finding of provocation was the evidence of the appellant himself.  If the jury did not consider that that evidence was, to use the words of the trial judge in his summing-up, ""possibly true"", the defence of provocation had to fail.  It would not have assisted the appellant for the jury to be told, as the appellant now contends it should have been, that if it did not believe the appellant, it should put his testimony to one side and consider whether the Crown had negatived provocation beyond reasonable doubt.  In a case where the only evidence of provocation was the accused's oral testimony, it was accurate, and less likely to confuse the jury, to direct it that it only had to consider whether the appellant acted under provocation if it considered the appellant's version of events to be ""possibly true"".  As in Regina v Niass [2005] NSWCCA 120, the direction given ""prevented any likelihood that the jury obtained the impression that it was only if they believed the appellant's evidence to be true that it could give rise to a reasonable doubt as to his guilt"" and the trial judge did not suggest that the jury had to choose whether to believe a Crown witness or the appellant (at [29]; see also R v Anderson [2001] NSWCCA 488; 127 A Crim R 116 at [25] - [28]).
25This ground of appeal suffers from the further fundamental difficulty that the appellant's counsel at the trial did not request the trial judge to give any direction of the type now under consideration.  The absence of such a request is a further indication of the fairness of the directions that the trial judge gave.  For the reasons I have given, there was no error in the trial judge not giving the direction now identified.  A fortiori no miscarriage of justice flowed from it not being given.  As a result, I would refuse to grant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to raise this ground of appeal.
APPEAL GROUND 2:  DIRECTION CONCERNING ""ANOTHER EQUALLY OPEN INFERENCE""
26During a break in the trial judge's summing-up, the appellant's counsel sought two additional directions.  The one which is now in issue was, after discussion with his Honour, described by the appellant's counsel as follows:
""Perhaps your Honour could simply put to them that the circumstances that you have referred to earlier [that] the Crown relied on as evidence of a plan to kill and the defence submission in respect of that was that it was equally consistent with either a plan to sneak up and confront the deceased or sneak up and attack him"" (emphasis added).
27After the jury returned, the trial judge gave as follows a further direction consistent with the appellant's counsel's request:
""The second thing, and this is an important matter which I should have said to you at the time, whilst the Crown contends that the inference that you would draw from all of that material is that the accused planned to kill the deceased, what Mr Trevallion said to you and the defence case is, that there is another equally open inference, that these matters were done, if you find they were done, in order to sneak up and scare and perhaps to threaten the deceased, but not with the intention to kill him.  In other words, there is another inference of planning.  Sure, they were going to do these matters, but it was not in order to kill him but to surprise him that night, so that the accused could then confront him and scare him.
You will remember what I said to you about drawing inferences, that if you are going to draw an inference against the accused it must be the only rational inference that is available from the material.  So you will have to consider each of those submissions.  The Crown says the only inference you would draw is that those matters lead to the inference that he planned to kill.  Mr Trevallion says no, there is this other inference, that he had just planned to scare and surprise him"" (emphasis added).
28The appellant's counsel on the appeal, who did not appear at the trial, recognised that the trial judge's additional direction reflected the appellant's trial counsel's request but nevertheless submitted that the direction was erroneous because it placed ""an onus on the appellant to prove that the inference contended for was 'equally open' on the evidence, rather than simply 'reasonably open'"".
29I reject this submission.  In referring to ""another equally open inference"" the trial judge expressly stated that he was referring to what had been put in the appellant's case (""what [the accused's counsel] said to you and the defence case is"").  This accurately reflected the following part of the appellant's counsel's address:
""[The Crown Prosecutor] has told you this was the plan.  The plan was to wait, sneak up, I think the words that the Crown has said were ambush.  Is ambush consistent with wanting to attack him and kill him, as the Crown suggests, or wanting to confront him and have it out with him?  It's equally consistent, so if he's in control at that point, what's changed?"" (emphasis added).
30Moreover, the trial judge immediately thereafter repeated his earlier direction that any inference to be drawn against the appellant ""must be the only rational inference that is available from the material"" (see [27] above).  He also said that the Crown referred to the relevant inference as the ""only inference"".
31The trial judge thus made it clear to the jury that the inference for which the Crown contended was to be rejected if there was an alternative rational inference available, not just if the alternative inference was considered to be equally available.  The jury could not reasonably have thought that it had to find that the appellant's competing inference was ""equally available"" in order to reject the inference for which the Crown contended.  It was told clearly that the Crown's inference had to be ""the only rational inference"".
32Again, there is in my view no reason to grant the appellant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to raise this ground of appeal.
ORDERS
33For the above reasons, I propose the following orders
(1)Refuse the appellant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon either of his grounds of appeal.
(2)Appeal dismissed.
34HIDDEN J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.
35LATHAM J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2762692,Martin v R [2013] NSWCCA 253,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceThe applicant was found guilty by a jury of an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  
2On 23 October 2008 Conlon DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and a balance of term of 2 years.  The earliest date on which the applicant is eligible for release on parole is 2 September 2015.
3The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence.   The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal:
Ground of Appeal:  His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120
4It was common ground between the applicant and the Crown that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred in the sentencing process in that the sentencing judge had given excessive weight to the standard non-parole period and had engaged in a two stage sentencing process.  On that issue generally this judgment should be read with Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.
Factual background to the offence
5The victim had known the applicant since April 2007 and regularly used to buy drugs on his behalf from suppliers in the area.  On the date of the offending (24 June 2007), she was in a relationship and was 14 weeks pregnant.  The applicant had expressed an interest in her but she had told him that that interest was not reciprocated.  
6Owing to her pregnancy, the victim did not want to continue to buy drugs for the applicant and introduced him to a friend of hers, Amy, who could buy drugs for him instead.  On occasions the victim, the applicant and Amy would go together to buy drugs while the applicant was getting to know Amy better.  On one of those occasions, a week or two before the offence was committed, the three of them went to purchase an eight ball for the applicant which was to cost about $600.  Amy handed over the $600 while the other two waited in the car.  Although they waited for hours, the supplier did not return with the drugs but kept the applicant's $600.  The applicant was angry at having lost his money.  He appeared to blame the victim for what had happened.
7On 24 June 2007 the applicant contacted the victim so that she could purchase drugs for him.  The victim felt sorry for the applicant because he had lost his money and agreed for him to pick her up with the intention of purchasing drugs.  
8The applicant picked her up about 3.30pm and she instructed him to drive to Unanderra.  Instead, the applicant drove to a secluded park next to a soccer oval at Figtree.  The applicant told the victim that they were there to have some drugs before they went to purchase drugs.  
9When the victim noticed that the applicant was not preparing drugs, she attempted to exit the vehicle.  She found that the door was locked and she did not know how to unlock it.  The applicant told the victim that she ""owed him big time"", referring to the loss of the $600 on the previous occasion.  He said that either Amy or she had ""ripped him"" and because of that he was going to have sex with her and that he was ""going to get his money's worth out of her"".
10The victim said that she was pregnant, that it was not her fault and that she did not want to have sex with him.  The applicant told her to ""go along with it"" and that it would be more enjoyable if she did.  The victim began to cry and started to get panicky and upset, while repeatedly asking the applicant not to do it.  The applicant then put one of his legs across her, grabbed both her wrists with his left hand and held them over her head.  He reclined her chair with his right hand and began to undo her clothes and his clothes with that hand.
11The victim continued to struggle and plead with the applicant while attempting to clench her thighs together.  After a period of struggling, the victim gave up and asked the applicant to ""at least use a condom"".  The applicant responded with words to the effect that ""it was great knowing that she had Daniel's kid in her gut and he would have to fix that"".   He also told her that he wanted to ""come inside her"" and wanted her to ""swallow it"". 
12The victim then felt the applicant inside her, looked the other way, closed her eyes and waited for it to be over.  He stopped 5 - 10 minutes later after he had ejaculated.  The victim then got dressed and the applicant drove her to her house.
Evidence of Post-Sentence Events
13On 13 September 2013 the applicant swore an affidavit relating to his time in custody.  He said that what he missed most was his family.  Three family members have died while he has been in custody - his father, his step-father and a granddaughter.  He has worked in a number of occupations while in gaol, often as a leading hand.  He expressed a willingness to do the CUBIT Sex Offender Program.  On 16 February 2012 the applicant failed a urine analysis test and stated that he was not willing or interested in doing the IDAPT Program (Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program).
Applicant's Subjective Circumstances
14The following matters are relevant to the applicant's subjective case.  The applicant is an Aboriginal person who is now aged 47.  At the time of the offending he was living in a de facto relationship with a woman with four children.  He had six children of his own from two previous relationships.  His contact with his children was sporadic.
15His father had an alcohol problem and left the family home when he was aged 8.  Shortly afterwards, his mother began a relationship with his step-father.  His family background appears to have been stable and supportive, although there is mention in one report that his step-father also had an alcohol problem.  The applicant left school after year 9 and has had a number of labouring jobs with unemployment benefits in between.  He had not worked for over a year before the offence.
16After he left school the applicant became involved with a motorcycle gang.  Although he eventually severed his connection with the gang, it was during this time that he began to use illicit substances.  He continued thereafter to use illicit drugs.  At the time of the offence he was experimenting with ice.  
Background to this application
17After having been sentenced, on 27 October 2008 the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in respect of the sentence.  On 17 November 2008 Legal Aid NSW received an application from him.  On 14 May 2009 legal aid was refused on the basis that the application was not considered to have reasonable prospects of success in accordance with the Legal Aid merit test.  
18On 15 October 2012 the applicant contacted the Standard Non-parole Period Review Team at Legal Aid NSW to inquire whether a review would be undertaken of his sentence.  On 29 January 2013 a letter was sent by Legal Aid NSW to the applicant advising that his case had been reviewed and inviting him to apply for legal aid.  In due course an application for leave to appeal against sentence was filed on 28 June 2013 which has resulted in this matter coming before the Court.
19Although the parties accepted that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred, the Crown did not accept that, pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the Act), any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law.
Delay
20The sentence was imposed on 24 October 2008.  The Notice of Intention to Appeal of 27 October 2008 lapsed.  Accordingly, an extension of time of nearly 5 years is sought for this application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
21The competing submissions in relation to delay, finality and the Court's consideration of those submissions are set out in Abdul v R at  [31] - [59].  Those submissions and the Court's conclusions in relation thereto are incorporated into this judgment.
22The extent of the delay is substantial and the explanation for it is not compelling.  Having considered the circumstances relating to the applicant's sentence, Legal Aid NSW rejected his application as having insufficient prospects of success.  The only change to those circumstances is the decision in Muldrock.  The principle of finality stands against an extension of time as does the potential for further psychological suffering by the victim.
23In those circumstances, the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion to determine whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted is determinative in this matter.  None of the other factors identified in the decided cases favour the granting of an extension of time.  
Submissions
24The substantial issue in this matter is whether material error having been established, this Court should in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, impose a lesser sentence because a lesser sentence is warranted in law (s6(3) of the Act).
25The applicant submitted that the sentence was excessive because there were no statutory aggravating features identified.  He relied upon his progress while in custody and his positive attitude to attending the CUBIT Sex Offender program.  
26The applicant noted that by reference to sentences imposed after the coming into effect of the standard non-parole period regime, the average sentence for s61I offences was imprisonment for 6 years with an average non-parole period of 3 years.  Of 81 cases where offenders pleaded not guilty and were sentenced to fulltime imprisonment, there were only 11 cases where a sentence higher than his was imposed.  The applicant submitted that this was indicative of his sentence being excessive.
27The Crown drew the Court's attention to countervailing considerations.  It submitted that the objective criminality of the offence was significant and that there was some element of planning and premeditation.  The victim was taken to a secluded place, forcibly restrained and then penile/vaginal intercourse took place, even though the applicant knew that the victim was pregnant.  The applicant's response to the victim's request that he use a condom was callous and indicated some ill will directed towards the victim's partner.  The Crown submitted that the remarks by the applicant before and during the offence were consistent with him using the sexual assault for a punitive purpose directed at the victim personally.
Consideration
28The applicant's subjective case is not strong.  His background as a child appears to have been stable and not to have contributed towards his addiction to drugs.  It was his participation in a motorcycle gang which appears to have been the catalyst for that.  There is no contrition or remorse for his behaviour, nor is there any insight into the effect of that behaviour on the victim.  
29While it is true that the applicant has apparently made progress while in custody, it is not clear whether that progress will translate into appropriate rehabilitation upon his release.  His refusal to undertake the IDAPT Program is a matter of concern.  The observation of the Court in R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 (Beazley P, Johnson and RA Hulme JJ) is pertinent to the position of this applicant:
""63 There is force in the Crown submission that the standard non-parole period may be a more significant factor on sentence of an offender where there is little operating in the offender's favour on sentence. Its significance in a particular case may vary."" 
30Statistics are of only limited value when considering offences of this kind.  The particular circumstances vary considerably as does the effect on the victim.  As was said by the plurality in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520:
""53  .... Care must be taken, however, in using what has been done in other cases.
54 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 
""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" 
But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"".  Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added).  When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".""
As the plurality said in Wong:
""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""""
31Observations to similar effect were made by Rothman J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adamson J agreed) in Lang, Dylan Craig v R [2013] NSWCCA 29:
""25 The applicant also relied on statistics to further the submissions on manifest excess. As has been previously noted by the High Court and this Court, one must be very careful in utilising statistics for offences: Wong v R; Leung v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [59]; Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520. Such statistics are useful for the purpose of showing trends in sentencing, but each sentence must be imposed on the basis of the sentencing principles and not on the basis of an adherence to statistical averages; Hili at [54].
26 Even on the statistics presented, the sentence imposed is within range, albeit at the higher end of the range, as is appropriate given the findings on objective criminality. Each offence (and the circumstances of the offender) is different. 

27 Moreover, to follow statistical ranges blindly would be to constrain inappropriately the exercise of discretion reposed in a sentencing judge and render statistics a self-fulfilling limit on the intuition to be exercised in sentencing. Nothing in the statistical material contradicts the view otherwise reached.
32In Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Price and RA Hulme JJ agreed) said:
""44 Although the statistics of the Judicial Commission may provide a useful guide they also make plain that the maximum penalty of 25 years may not have been afforded appropriate significance when sentencing for this offence.  It is important to remember that the sentences which have been imposed and reflected in the relevant statistics must be approached with care lest they operate to confine the practical application of the full range of potential sentences provided by the statutory maximum.""
33The applicant referred to particular cases and sought to demonstrate that the sentence imposed in this case was excessive.  In that regard, it need only be said that the facts of those cases were markedly different to those which are presently before the Court.  Ultimately this Court has to decide for itself whether on the particular facts before it a lesser sentence than that imposed by the sentencing judge is warranted in law.  I am not so persuaded.
34It follows that to allow the application for leave to appeal against sentence to proceed would not have sufficient prospects of success to justify the considerable extension of time that the applicant seeks.   The order which I propose is that the application for extension of time be dismissed.
35JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
36BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2762693,Kertai v R [2013] NSWCCA 252,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:The applicant was convicted after trial by jury of sexual intercourse with a child under 10, contrary to s66A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The circumstance of aggravation was that the child was under his authority.  The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.  By virtue of s54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (CSP Act) that offence attracted a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  On 24 June 2011 the applicant was sentenced by Berman DCJ to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years.  The earliest date he is eligible for release on parole is 1 February 2017.  
2The applicant relies upon three grounds of appeal.
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified inMuldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.
Ground 3:  The sentence is manifestly excessive.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
3The offence occurred when the applicant was aged 69.  The victim was a young girl aged 5.  The offence occurred on 22 January 2010 when the offender took the victim fishing.  
4For many years the applicant was a friend of the victim's father.  He would buy her gifts and had taken her fishing on other occasions.  On 22 January 2010 the applicant asked the victim's father if he could take her fishing once more and permission was given.
5Together they went to a beach at Sans Souci.  After fishing for a while and the victim playing in the sand, they got back in the car.  In the words of the victim, the following occurred:
""He wanted to have a look at my wee-wee so I said no.  He said please, I said no.  He said please.  He was bothering me and so I said okay because it was bothering me.""
When the victim was asked what happened next, she said:
""He touched it.  He touched it too inside and he hurt me.""
6The victim made it clear that the applicant actually penetrated her genitals with his finger causing her to say ""ouch"".  From other things that the victim told the police, it appears that the applicant kept his finger inside her genitals for about five seconds.  The applicant then drove the victim home.
7The victim said nothing to her father about what had occurred but that evening while she was being bathed by her mother she told her what had happened.  The victim's mother complained to the police and the victim was examined by a doctor.  He found nothing abnormal, but gave evidence at trial that this was not surprising given the circumstances of the assault.  The victim's mother said that when she examined the victim, she observed some slight swelling of the victim's genitalia.  
8In the course of the sentence proceedings, the sentencing judge said:
""There is no Victim Impact Statement in this matter but of course that does not mean that the victim has not been harmed.  She was not at that very young age where juvenile amnesia might operate to spare her memories of what occurred.  I will sentence the offender on the basis that it is quite likely that while the complainant was not physically harmed, she will be emotionally affected by what he did to her."" (ROS 3.2)
9The applicant had been convicted of a similar offence in the past.   On 19 April 2001 he received a 2 year suspended sentence for sexual offences against a child under 16.  The victim was the 9 year old daughter of a family friend.  The offences occurred between 1983 and 1986 but the applicant was not arrested for them until 1998.  The applicant denied those offences and was convicted after a jury trial.  Otherwise the applicant's criminal record contained minor offences including stealing, entering enclosed lands and a low range PCA.
10The applicant came to Australia from Hungary at the age of 16.  The applicant completed school when he came to Australia but experienced some difficulty in that regard and was suspended from several schools.  He studied architectural drafting and building but did not pursue either career.  Over the years, he engaged in a number of employments and until the 1990's when he went on welfare benefits, was regularly employed.  
11The applicant had been married but the relationship broke up.  He was not married at the time of the offending.  He has no children.
12In relation to the severity of the offending, the sentencing judge said:
""Of course because the offence carries with it a standard non-parole period it is important that I make a finding as to where the offence falls as far as its objective gravity is concerned.  I find that it is slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.  Working in the offender's favour is the fact that the form of sexual intercourse involved, digital penetration, is in the circumstances of this case, much less serious than other forms of sexual intercourse covered by the offence.  That penetration was only of short duration too, around five seconds it would seem, and it was an isolated offence, not repeated.  Apart from swelling perhaps noticed by the complainant's mother, no injury was caused.""  (ROS 4.8)
13The sentencing judge noted that the victim was significantly younger than the 10 year cut off for the offence and was an unwilling participant in what occurred which the applicant clearly knew.  His Honour also took into account that some pain had been caused to the victim.  The applicant displayed no remorse for what he had done and continued to deny any wrongdoing during the sentence proceedings.  His Honour noted that the offence involved a significant breach of trust.
14The sentencing judge took into account that the applicant had a number of health issues, but observed that most of those health issues had been placed before the court when he was sentenced in 2001.  His Honour said:
""It needs to be emphasised that ill health is not a licence to commit crime but with that qualification, I do note and take into account that the offender will do his time in custody harder than a person who does not suffer from the conditions which afflict the offender.""  (ROS 5.3)
15His Honour took into account that it was likely that the applicant would serve the entirety of his sentence in protection and that there was at least a risk that those conditions of custody would be harder than those which would otherwise be found in the general prison population.  
16His Honour made a finding of special circumstances because of the applicant's age and because this would be the first time that he had actually gone to prison.  The commencement of the sentence was backdated to 2 February 2010, being the date when the applicant first went into custody.
Background to this application
17After having been sentenced, the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in relation to sentence and conviction on 15 July 2011.  On 21 September 2011 Legal Aid NSW received an application for legal aid from him.  On 20 June 2012 he was refused legal aid because the application was not considered to have reasonable prospects of success in accordance with the Legal Aid merit test.  This was well after the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
18Between 21 August and 20 November 2012 the applicant's file was reviewed by Legal Aid NSW to determine whether the sentence contained ""Muldrock-type errors"".  The applicant completed a further application for legal aid which resulted in these proceedings coming before the Court.
19For a general background to applications of this kind and ""Muldrock error"", this judgment should be read with Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.
Delay
20The sentence was imposed on 24 June 2011.  A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed within time on 15 July 2011 but was not pursued and lapsed.  Accordingly, an extension of time of just over two years is sought.  By comparison with other matters involving alleged ""Muldrock error"", the extent of the delay is not particularly great.  Nevertheless, the principles relating to delay and finality will need to be considered.
21If ""Muldrock error"" is not made out, there is no explanation for delay and no basis for a submission that had s54B(1) of the CSP Act been correctly applied, a lesser sentence would have been imposed.  Moreover, the absence of ""Muldrock error"" gives greater force to the principles of delay and finality when considering Grounds of Appeal 2 and 3.
22The Crown does not accept that ""Muldrock error"" has occurred.  In the alternative, if ""Muldrock error"" is found to have occurred, the Crown does not accept that in accordance with s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) a lesser sentence should be imposed.  The Crown opposed any extension of time being granted.
Was there Muldrock error?
23The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred by:
(a) Adopting a two stage approach to sentencing and
(b) Giving determinative weight to the standard non-parole period.
24In support of that submission, the applicant relied upon that part of the sentencing judgment where his Honour said:
""Of course because the offence carries with it a standard non-parole period it is important that I make a finding as to where the offence falls as far as its objective gravity is concerned.  I find that it is slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.""  (ROS 4.8)
25The applicant submitted that the degree of specificity in the finding of objective seriousness, i.e. ""being slightly below mid-range"" indicated that the sentencing judge was mindful of the line of authority in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.  The applicant submitted that such an approach was contrary to the ""instinctive synthesis"" approach described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 which was expressly approved in Muldrock.
26I am not satisfied that ""Muldrock error"" has occurred as submitted by the applicant.  The only part of the remarks on sentence which deals with the application of the standard non-parole period is the quotation relied upon by the applicant at [24] hereof.  Nowhere else is it referred to.  The remarks on sentence are otherwise quite unexceptionable in that they summarise the facts of the offending, the applicant's subjective case and set out sentencing principles.  
27It is not an error for a sentencing judge to make a finding of objective seriousness (Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [45] - [46]).  On the contrary, Muldrock emphasised the importance of an assessment of ""objective seriousness"" in the sentencing process (at [27]).  There are a number of decisions in this Court that post-date the decision in Muldrock to the effect that it is not an inappropriate exercise for a sentencing judge to make an evaluation of the objective seriousness of an offence (Zarakas v R [2013] NSWCCA 144 at [35]).
28In my opinion the finding of objective seriousness ""slightly below"" the midrange did not disclose a precision indicative of an approach which was unduly prescriptive and that indicated that the standard non-parole period played a greater role on sentence than that of a legislative guidepost.  Most importantly, the sentencing judge did not engage in a two-step process, but rather identified all the factors which were relevant to sentence, discussed their significance and then made an assessment of what was the appropriate sentence.
29A proper reading of the sentencing remarks does not demonstrate the errors identified in Muldrock.  As already indicated, the sentencing judge applied an instinctive synthesis approach consistent with Markarian whereby he determined the appropriate sentence after identifying all relevant factors and their significance.  His consideration of the objective gravity of the applicant's offence was part of that process of instinctive synthesis leading to the formulation of the sentence which was imposed.
30This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.
Ground 3:  The sentence is manifestly excessive.
31The rejection of the first ground of appeal gives rise to a significant difficulty for the applicant when relying upon these grounds of appeal.  The extent of the delay, while not as long as in some other of these cases, is still substantial, i.e. in excess of 2 years.  That delay has not been explained.  The only explanation offered was that which related to the handing down of the decision in Muldrock.  Accordingly, the principles of delay and finality operate even more decisively against an extension of time being granted for the hearing of an application for leave to appeal against sentence based on these grounds.
32The relevant principles have been discussed in Abdul v R at [31] - [53].  To the extent necessary those paragraphs are incorporated into this judgment.
33The factors identified in that discussion do not assist the applicant in his application for an extension of time.  They all point to an extension of time being refused.  This leaves as the only issue to be considered whether a refusal to extend time would result in a substantial injustice.
34An assessment of objective seriousness of an offence has always been regarded as a discretionary exercise by the sentencing judge.  There have been a number of statements by this Court to the effect that the Court should be slow to depart from a sentencing judge's conclusion as to objective seriousness of an offence:  (R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430; Perry v R [2006] NSWCCA 351; 166 A Crim R 383; Stanford v R [2007] NSWCCA 73; R v Fisher [2008] NSWCCA 103).
35In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ (Simpson J agreeing) said at [37]:
""37 Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts.  This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.  The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.  In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.
In a separate judgment Simpson J added at [46]:
""46 The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge.  It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion.  As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55CLR 499.  The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated.  It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge.  That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position.  It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system.  Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.""
36The type of intercourse is not determinative.  On that issue, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) said in R v Ronald King [2009] NSWCCA 117:
""35 ... It is unnecessary to enter into a debate about the significance in sentencing of different types of penetration that fall within the concept of sexual intercourse: see R v Hibbert [2009] NSWCCA 20. The simple fact is that the respondent inserted his finger into the child's vagina for however brief a period of time so as to cause her a physical injury with pain at least of a transient nature. He did so notwithstanding that the child awoke and told him to stop.
36 The respondent argues that it was open for his Honour to find that digital penetration was less serious than penile penetration and this was a very significant fact in the assessment of the degree of criminality. But it has been made clear that it is not a case of simply considering the nature of the penetration in isolation as being ranked in some form of hierarchy: R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575. What is to be considered is the type of penetration in all the circumstances surrounding the offending. The type of penetration is simply one factor and by itself does not indicate how serious the particular offence is. The simple fact is that had the intercourse in this case been penile penetration it would have been an offence of very great seriousness if for no other reason than because of the age of the child. In such a case the seriousness of the offence may have been above mid range. But the fact that it was not penile penetration does not mean that the offence is reduced to low range.""
37In my opinion, no error in this part of the sentence process has been identified.  By reference to the matters identified by his Honour at [13] hereof, the assessment of objective seriousness was well open to him.  
38The test for whether a sentence is manifestly excessive is whether the sentence ultimately imposed was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:
""59 As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen, ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"".  Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong, ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"".  But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition.  And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error"".""
39The sentencing judge fully reviewed the facts of the offending in this matter.  The salient features were that the complainant was only 5 years old, the applicant was solely in charge of her at the time he procured a situation where she could not avail herself of the protection of her parents.  She was in a confined and restricted place with him when he initiated the offending.  She was extremely young and very vulnerable.  In the circumstances of this offence, I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".
Conclusion
40It follows that even if an extension of time were granted and leave to appeal against sentence was granted, Grounds of Appeal 2 and 3 have not been made out.  It would be futile to grant an extension of time in such circumstances.

		08 November 2013",2013-11-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762694,MB v R [2013] NSWCCA 254,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  Offence and sentenceIn 2006 the applicant was convicted after a trial by jury of one count of murder, contrary to s18 of the Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment.  The offence attracts a standard non-parole period of 20 years.
2On 10 November 2006 the applicant was sentenced by Howie J to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 6 years and 6 months.  The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 7 January 2021.
3The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him.  The grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant are:
Ground of Appeal 1:  His Honour erred in his application of the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
Ground of Appeal 2:  The sentence is manifestly excessive.
4It was common ground between the applicant and the Crown that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred in the sentencing process in that the sentencing judge had given excessive weight to the standard non-parole period and had engaged in a two stage sentencing process.  On that issue generally this judgment should be read with Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.
Factual background to the offence
5The facts are best dealt with by extracts from the remarks of Howie J on sentence (R v MB [2006] NSWSC 1164):
""3 On the date of his death the deceased was a resident of Mayfield and a member of the Australian Air Force. He was aged 20 years. On 7 July last year he and a long-standing friend, Joe Stevenson, who was at the time resident in Victoria, decided to go out and get drunk together in Mayfield. Because they were intending to consume alcohol, the two decided to walk between the various establishments they intended to visit.
4 At the same time the offender and a number of young persons from a local football team, the Cheetahs, met together in a shed at the back of a house in Waratah Street, Mayfield for the purposes of a house warming. About a dozen young men aged between 15 and 17 years arrived at the premises some bringing alcohol. At about 10.30 pm the group moved into Waratah Street because it was getting too crowded and noisy. ...
5 ...  the deceased and Mr Stevenson were walking down Hanbury Street in the direction of Waratah railway station toward the Ex-Servicemen's Club. They were both intoxicated as they had been drinking beer with spirit chasers at a hotel a short distance away. They were in high spirits as they walked along the footpath on the opposite side of the road from the park. However something about their behaviour attracted the attention of some of the young men who were in the close vicinity.  I am unable to say what it was that occurred between them but it resulted in some of the group, including the offender, running into Hanbury Street to confront the deceased and Mr Stevenson.  ...
6 Once again I do not know what immediately transpired but I have no doubt that the aggressors were the offender and his group and that they were surrounding the other two in a threatening manner. ...
7 At about this time the deceased and the offender began fighting. Although I am not sure of the exact order of events, I have no doubt that it was the offender who was the first to be physically violent. I do not know what it was that provoked this attack. The accused did not give evidence at the trial nor did he participate in an interview with police. He refused to discuss the matter with those preparing the juvenile justice report except to deny that he was responsible, alleging that he had been ""set up"". Therefore, there has never been an account given by him of the events leading up to the death of the deceased.
8 While Mr Stevenson was engaged with the other youths, one of whom punched him in the face fracturing his jaw, the deceased and the offender were involved in what could be described as fisticuffs. ...  However, it seems that the deceased generally got the better of the encounter although there was no real risk of either of them inflicting any serious injury on the other.
...
10 There were, however, a number of witnesses who gave evidence of the attack upon the deceased that caused his fatal injuries.  At some stage the fight between the deceased and the offender moved across the road to be directly outside the Ex Servicemen's Club.  At the same time Mr Stevenson and the group around him moved into the middle of the road towards the club. The fight between the offender and the deceased appeared to come to an end, with the deceased apparently victorious because he approached some members of the group standing nearby.  It was then that he was struck in the face by one of the youths and the deceased moved back as a result. Meanwhile the offender had run to where one of his group was standing with a bottle in his hand. He grabbed the bottle, bent down to break it on the road and then ran at the deceased striking him with the broken bottle in the neck.  The blow was downward in a stabbing motion and with such force that it chipped one of the deceased's bones in his face.  It severed his throat and he bled to death while his friend tried vainly to administer aid to him to stem the loss of blood. 
11 As soon as the offender had struck the deceased, he and his group fled from the scene back towards Waratah Street and the park. The offender shortly after met up with two of the group in a laneway at the far end of the park. There he said, ""I got him"".  Eventually a number of the group, including the offender, returned to the shed where they had earlier been drinking.  At this time it was seen that the offender had a badly cut hand.  There was some consternation about the events and the offender was crying.  Two of the youths attempted to clean up the wound, stop the bleeding and make sure that there was no glass in it.  At some stage the offender said, ""I didn't mean to do it. I hope he doesn't die"".
...
14 The offender is a young man born on 26 June 1989. He was aged 16 at the time of the offence.  He was born in Papua New Guinea and has three siblings, two younger who reside with their parents in the Newcastle area and one older brother who is in PNG. The offender's father describes his family as being within the middle to upper class in PNG.  He is a person of some status and authority in his homeland.  The family first came to Newcastle in 2000, when the offender was aged 11 years, so that his father could pursue a course of study.  They returned to PNG in 2002 but returned again to Australia in 2004.  ...
15 The offender's upbringing was uneventful and he has a strong supportive extended family in PNG. He has been described as an average student with no behavioural problems although he was suspended in Year 7 for fighting.  He says that this was a response to racial taunts.  He has continued his education while in custody and attained his Year 10 certificate.  He appears motivated to continue with studies and self-improvement courses.  A large number of certificates and reports were tendered on his behalf.  His behaviour while in custody has been good.
16 A psychiatric report indicates that he has a stable mental state with no evidence of any disorders. He has been coping in custody and is supported by his parents.  ...
...
18 The family has a strong religious background. The offender's father gave evidence before the Court, as did the pastor of the church that the family attends.  It seems that when they first came to the Newcastle area the whole family regularly attended services and the offender was a participant in a children's programme organised by the church.  At that time he was considered by the pastor to have been a ""very well behaved young man"".  When the family returned to Australia on the second occasion, the family attended the same church but not the offender.  It seems that he formed a strong relationship with a group of friends who were not part of the congregation but were members of the rugby league team for which he played.  At the age of 15 the offender began drinking alcohol because of this association notwithstanding that he was encouraged not to do so by his father. ...
19 Since the commission of the offence and his incarceration the offender has conceded to the pastor that he ""strayed away from his values"" at the time of the offending.  He has, however, expressed a recommitment to his church and his faith.  ...
20 The offender has no prior criminal record.  However, there is evidence before me of other acts of violence by the offender to young persons apparently when he was in a rage about some perceived wrongdoing committed by them against him.  ... I am not prepared to find that the present offence was totally out of character for the offender at that time.  I do accept, however, that his behaviour was to some extent a result of the company he was then keeping and that he had, in his words ""moved away from the values"" that had been instilled in him by his parents and through the church.  ...
21 Insofar as the offender has now broken with those associates and re-established connections with his family and church I believe that it is conduct that is unlikely to reoccur.  But it is still a matter of concern that the offender could, for some reason that I do not fully understand, act with such violence as he displayed to the deceased.  I do accept that there was an element of peer group pressure arising from his involvement with the other youths and I do not believe that the offender was the only person responsible for all the injuries suffered by the deceased.  ...
...
25 The offence is a serious example of homicide notwithstanding the Crown's concession.  The offender must at least have intended to inflict grievous bodily harm of a very severe kind.  He might not have intended to strike the deceased in the throat, but he armed himself with what was a very dangerous weapon and struck at the deceased with a forceful blow in the direction of his torso.  ...
...
28 In my opinion the offence falls within the midrange of objective seriousness.   ...  Clearly the most significant factor is the offender's age both at the time of the commission of the offence and now at the time of sentencing. Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act applies but there is little in the stated principles that has particular significance in the sentencing task before me so serious is the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced.
29 Generally when sentencing a person of the offender's age a court gives predominance to rehabilitation so far as it can do so consistently with the other purposes of punishment.  General deterrence may play a lesser role because of the need to encourage and assist the young offender.  But where the offence is one that arises from conduct frequently committed by young persons and is of grave seriousness, general deterrence may have to be appropriately reflected in the sentence.   I have already indicated my opinion that general deterrence is important in dealing with offences of public violence committed by groups of young males.  Further the use of bottles or glasses to inflict serious injuries on other persons in places where alcohol is being consumed is itself all too common.  Therefore the court should clearly denounce such conduct and seek to deter it by the imposition of severe sentences where the injuries inflicted are grave.
30 There is positive evidence of the rehabilitation of the offender by his commitment to return to the church and readopt his family's values.  He has been working positively in custody to address personal issues and continue his education.  It is of concern that he refuses to acknowledge his guilt.  Even though there is evidence of compassion for the deceased's family, there is no evidence of contrition or remorse for any of his conduct.  It may simply be the fact that he cannot bring himself to accept what he has done.  ...
...
32 This is a case where special circumstances should be found by reason of the offender's age and in order to promote his rehabilitation.  However, I must keep in mind the standard non-parole period as a guidepost to the appropriate sentence.  I cannot reduce the non-parole period by factors personal to the offender such that it does not truly reflect the objective seriousness of the offending or bear a proper relationship with the standard non-parole period fixed by Parliament for the offence of murder, even where the offence is committed by a juvenile.  I think that it is fair to note that the non-parole period is longer than I would have imposed but for the standard non-parole period provisions.""
6As Howie J indicated, the applicant was aged 16 at the time of the offence.  It should, however, be noted that he had only turned 16 ten days before the offence.
Background to this application
7After having been sentenced on 27 November 2006 the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in respect of the sentence and conviction.  On 30 November 2006 Legal Aid NSW received an application for legal aid from the applicant.  On 9 November 2007 the applicant was refused legal aid as the application was not considered to have reasonable prospects of success in accordance with the Legal Aid merit test.
8Notwithstanding the refusal to grant legal aid, the applicant's family raised the money for an appeal but only in relation to conviction.  The appeal against conviction proceeded in this Court and on 19 August 2009 it was dismissed (MB v R [2009] NSWCCA 200).  
9On 28 September 2012 the applicant telephoned a person from the Standard Non-parole Review Team of Legal Aid NSW.  As a result of that conversation, the applicant made a further application for legal aid on 18 December 2012 which resulted in this matter coming before the Court.
10As indicated, there was no issue between the applicant and the Crown that error of the kind identified in Muldrock v The Queen had occurred.  The Crown did not, however, accept that pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (the Act), any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law.  The Crown opposed an extension of time being granted.
Delay
11The sentence was imposed on 10 November 2006.  The Notice of Intention to Appeal against sentence of 27 November 2006 was not pursued.  Accordingly, an extension of time of almost 7 years is sought for this application for leave to appeal against sentence.
12The competing submissions in relation to delay and finality, and the Court's consideration of those submissions are set out in Abdul v R at [31] - [59].  Those submissions and the Court's conclusions in relation thereto are incorporated into this judgment.
13The explanation for delay is not compelling.  Having considered the circumstances relating to the applicant's sentence, Legal Aid NSW rejected the applicant's application as having insufficient prospects of success.  Inferentially, when the applicant's family retained legal advisors to argue the conviction appeal, some consideration must have been given to whether an appeal against sentence should be pursued.  From the fact that this was not done, I also infer that it was the opinion of those legal advisors that an appeal against sentence should not be pursued.
14That having been said, the decision not to proceed with an appeal against sentence may have been influenced by the approach to standard non-parole periods set out in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.  For example, a consideration of whether to pursue an appeal against sentence based on ""manifest excess"" would have had to take into account that s54B(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) as interpreted by Way had prescriptive effect where a matter had proceeded to verdict.
15There is another important consideration relating to delay.  Section 4 Schedule 2 of the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008 (NSW) relevantly amended the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by inserting s54D(3).  This section provided:
""This Division does not apply to the sentencing of an offender in respect of an offence if the offender was under the age of 18 at the time the offence was committed.""
16The relevant transitional provision provided:
""60 Standard non-parole periods
(1) An amendment made to s54D by the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008 does not affect any sentence imposed before the commencement of that amendment.""
17This means that had leave been sought to appeal against sentence at the same time as the conviction appeal was heard in 2009, and had this Court decided to intervene in relation to sentence, it would not have had regard to the standard non-parole period, notwithstanding the decision in Way.  It follows, therefore, that the applicant has not gained a ""windfall benefit"" by his delay in not seeking leave to appeal against sentence until now.  
Submissions and consideration
18Since ""Muldrock error"" of a material kind has clearly occurred, it is necessary for this Court to consider in accordance with s6(3) of the Act whether any lesser sentence than that imposed by Howie J is warranted in law.  In carrying out that exercise, the Court has to re-exercise the sentencing discretion afresh taking into account factual circumstances as they presently exist, not as they were at the time of sentence (Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284, Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455;159 A Crim R 154).  Most particularly, as the Crown acknowledged, the Court has to disregard entirely the standard non-parole period:  BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; 201 A Crim R 379 at 388 [36].  The Court is, of course, bound by the findings of the sentencing judge except to the extent that those findings might need to be reconsidered because of subsequent events.
19There have been changes to the applicant's subjective case.  In 2007 the applicant was diagnosed with a pancreatic tumour.  Although the tumour has been removed, the applicant will be required to take medication for the rest of his life to compensate for the missing portion of his pancreas.  That medication is required to enable the applicant to digest food.  While in custody, the applicant has completed his higher school certificate, achieving above average marks in all subjects.  His family continues to provide support for him.
20The applicant submitted that once the standard non-parole period is set to one side, it is necessary to give full effect to his youth and most particularly his lack of maturity.  The applicant submitted that this is to be reflected in his inability to fully appreciate the potentially devastating results of his actions on the night of the offence.  The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge was unable to fully give effect to those considerations because of his approach to the standard non-parole period, but that this Court is not so constrained.
21The Crown did not traverse those propositions but reminded the Court of particular aspects of the offending which justified the sentence which had been imposed:
(a) The attack was unprovoked.
(b) The applicant initiated the attack.
(c) After the initial confrontation had come to an end, it was the applicant who had escalated the level of violence by taking a bottle, smashing it and striking the deceased.
(d) The stabbing was unprovoked.
(e) Neither the applicant nor his friends attempted to get assistance for the deceased.
22The matters raised by the Crown are relevant and important.  They were, however, all taken into account by the sentencing judge and as findings of fact, have been taken into account by this Court.  Notwithstanding those important matters, and notwithstanding the profound effect which the death of the deceased has had on his family and the terrible waste involved in the death of a young person who was held in such high esteem by all who came in contact with him, I have concluded that because of the effect of the standard non-parole period on the sentencing judge's reasoning, insufficient weight was given to the applicant's youth.  
23As Howie J had acknowledged in the course of his remarks on sentence, the non-parole period set in this case was longer than the period which would have been fixed if the standard non-parole period did not apply:  R v MB at [32].
24This Court has recognised the significance of youth and immaturity in sentencing young offenders:  KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571 at 577-578 [22]-[26]; BP v R at 381-382 [2]-[7], 394-397 [73]-[78], 400-401 [97]-[104], 402 [107]-[108]; AI v R [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [67]-[69].
25Where emotional immaturity or a young person's less-than-fully developed capacity to control impulsive behaviour contributes to offending, this will be relevant to an assessment of penalty:  TM v R [2008] NSWCCA 158 at [33]-36]; KT v R at 578 [23]; BP v R at 381 [4].  It has been recognised that emotional maturity and impulse control develop progressively through adolescence:  BP v R at 381 [5].
26Of course, the fact that youth and immaturity may be relevant to sentence may serve to explain why the legislature in 2008 determined that the standard non-parole period system should not apply to young offenders:  BP v R at 400 [98].
27This Court has kept in mind, as well, the need for appropriate weight to be given to general deterrence and retribution when sentencing a young offender for serious offences of violence:  KT v R at 578 [25].  In AI v R at [69], Hodgson JA (Adams and Hall JJ agreeing) accepted that, in relation to crimes of violence committed in the streets by groups of young persons, considerations of general deterrence should be given substantial weight, notwithstanding the youth of the offenders.
28The applicant in this case was 16 years and two weeks' old at the time of the offence.  His youth and immaturity, involving poor impulse control, contributed to the commission of this grave crime.  The violent incident escalated quickly with fatal consequences.  At the same time, the offence involved a violent crime committed in a public street, so that general deterrence must be accorded substantial weight on sentence.
29Taking into account these considerations, without regard being had to the standard non-parole period, it is clear (as the sentencing Judge acknowledged) that a lesser non-parole period (and sentence) is required.  In this case the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion to determine whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted is determinative.  I have concluded that substantial injustice would follow if an extension of time were not granted.  I consider that those considerations displace the principle of finality and I would grant an extension of time.
30It follows from the above that the applicant should be re-sentenced and that in doing so full weight should be given to his youth.
31The orders which I propose are:
(1) Grant an extension of time within which to bring an application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
(2) Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
(3) Quash the sentence imposed by Howie J on 10 November 2006.
(4) In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years and 6 months commencing 8 July 2005 and expiring on 7 January 2018 with a balance of term of 5 years expiring on 7 January 2023.  The date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole is 7 January 2018.

33BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2762697,MJ v R [2013] NSWCCA 250,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  In 2012 the appellant was tried before Solomon DCJ, sitting in a judge alone trial, on eight counts of aggravated indecent assault and four counts of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16.  The alleged victim in each instance was the appellant's natural daughter, CD.  There were six separate episodes of alleged offending.
2By judgment of 14 December 2012, the trial judge convicted the appellant on all counts, save count 5.  His Honour subsequently sentenced him to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 12 years, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 6 years.
3The periods of time covered by the counts commenced on 1 December 1989, when CD was 11, and concluded on 31 December 1995, when she was 17.  
4It is sufficient for the purpose of addressing the appellant's grounds of appeal to set out the following counts in the Indictment:
""2. Between 19 October 1990 and 30 April 1991 at Kenthurst in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did assault CD and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency upon CD a child then under the age of 16 years, namely 12 years, as well as being a person under the authority of MJ.

Section 61E(1A) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)Law Part Code: 263"".  
THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL
The complainant's evidence
5CD gave evidence that the first charged sexual assault by her father occurred when the complainant was living with her mother, father and siblings at a property in Kenthurst, New South Wales.  The conduct charged in Counts 1 to 8 inclusive occurred prior to CD, her mother and siblings moving to a property in Riverstone, New South Wales.  Before that move, the marriage of CD's mother and the appellant deteriorated and, apparently for work reasons, the appellant moved to Melbourne.  CD said that the conduct alleged in Counts 9, 10 and 11 occurred when the appellant visited the Riverstone property.
6She said that the conduct alleged in Count 12, which involved the appellant fondling her breasts over her shirt, occurred after she had moved with her family to Cherrybrook in Sydney and when she was in Year 11 at school.
Complaint evidence
7CD's general practitioner (Dr Daniella Florida), mother and closest friend gave evidence that in 1994 or 1995 CD asserted to them that she had been sexually abused by her father.  CD explained the absence of earlier complaint by her fear of her father.
8Ms Frances Huber, a registered psychologist, gave evidence that CD had complained to her in 2010 that her father had sexually abused her when she was between the ages of 8 and 16.
The horsewhip evidence
9CD gave evidence that the appellant disciplined her with a horsewhip and threatened to use it on her if she did not comply with his sexual demands. 
10CD's mother, brother and youngest sister each gave evidence that the appellant had used the horsewhip to discipline CD.
Context evidence
11CD gave context evidence of various sexual assaults on her by her father which were not the subject of charges in the Indictment.  This included evidence of incidents which occurred when the appellant took his children to the Gold Coast in 1994 and when CD came to visit him in Melbourne in 1994, as well as evidence of prior abuse when the family lived in Warrandyte in Melbourne, before moving to Kenthurst.  
The appellant's case
12The appellant gave evidence denying the sexual conduct of which CD gave evidence.  He had similarly denied it in an electronically recorded interview with the police in January 2012.  He claimed that he had a fairly good relationship with CD.
13In the police interview, he asserted that what he regarded as the lies CD told were attributable to her being upset about the break up of her parents' marriage and to a withholding by him of money for driving lessons for CD.
14In his police interview, the appellant also denied ever using a horsewhip to discipline his children but in his oral evidence at the trial, whilst saying that he did not recall using the horsewhip, he accepted that he probably did.  
15The appellant's present wife also gave evidence in the defence case.  She said that her relationship with the appellant had commenced in 1995 and that their engagement had been announced to his children at a restaurant dinner later that year.  She said that the occasion had been a happy one and that CD had responded happily to the announcement.  She said that CD had never made a complaint to her about her relationship with the appellant.
THE JUDGMENT AT FIRST INSTANCE
16In his decision of 14 December 2012, the trial judge carefully examined the evidence that had been called and the submissions that had been made in the nine days over which the trial was conducted.  As well, he noted various directions that he gave himself to guide his determination of the proceedings.
17His Honour found that there were some respects in which CD had given incorrect evidence and that there were some inconsistencies between a statement given by her to the police and the evidence that she gave in Court.  
18First, his Honour found that CD had given incorrect evidence regarding the time and place of the appellant first sexually assaulting her.  This conduct was not the subject of any charges, presumably because it allegedly occurred at Warrandyte in Victoria.  His Honour found that the incorrectness of the evidence was relevant to CD's credit, but only to a minor degree.
19Secondly, his Honour found that CD had given incorrect evidence regarding the duration of her trip to Melbourne and the accused going to work each day during her stay.  Again he found that this affected CD's credit but only to a minor degree.  
20Thirdly, his Honour concluded that CD's credibility was not adversely affected by differences between her police statement and her evidence in Court.
21Fourthly, his Honour rejected the appellant's counsel's submission that CD gave incorrect evidence concerning the trip with her father and siblings to the Gold Coast.  He did not consider that her evidence that the holiday unit in which the family stayed contained three bedrooms was incorrect.  This was of significance in relation to the appellant's opportunity to commit the sexual assaults that CD alleged were committed there.  This finding is the subject of the appellant's fourth ground of appeal, which I address later in this judgment.  
22The trial judge's conclusions concerning the complainant's credibility were as follows:
""I now turn to my overall assessment of the complainant's evidence in the case.  I have scrutinised her evidence with great care and have had regard to all the evidence in the case.  I have had regard to the manner in which she gave her evidence. The complainant's cross-examination made significant concessions regarding her behaviour during her mid teen years.  I was most impressed with the way in which the complainant gave her evidence both in chief and in cross-examination.  The complainant's evidence regarding the alleged sexual abuse, being the subject of the charges, has the ring of truth to it, and overall the narrative contained in the complainant's evidence was, to my mind, cogent and believable.
I find the complainant to be a witness of truth as to the essential parts of her evidence, despite her giving incorrect evidence regarding the place and date of the early alleged sexual abuse perpetrated upon her, details regarding the Melbourne trip, and omissions and admissions between the police statement and her evidence.  All in all I find the complainant to be a reliable witness"".
23The trial judge then considered the evidence concerning the appellant's use of a horsewhip to discipline CD.  Having noted that the appellant's denial in his police interview of this conduct was in conflict with the evidence of CD, her mother, her brother and youngest sister, his Honour said:
""The accused in his evidence indicated that he was confused when he gave the answer in the ERISP regarding the horse whip.  I do not accept the accused's evidence about him being confused.  The accused during the ERISP did not appear to be confused in relation to any of the questions given to him.  The accused in the ERISP was able to provide dates and times going back many many years.  The accused appeared to answer all questions in the ERISP confidently, including the questions regarding the horse whip.  I find the accused told police a deliberate lie when he said, 'I never used a horse whip on a child in my life.  I wouldn't use a horse whip.'
I do not accept the accused's evidence given in the trial that he could not recall using a horse whip on his children.  I come to this view using my commonsense, it being that no-one would not remember using a horse whip on a child"".
24His Honour's ultimate conclusions were as follows:
""Like the complainant, I found the accused to give his evidence in a clear, lucid and open manner.  I found the accused who was skilfully cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor maintained during his cross-examination his clear, lucid and open manner in answering questions.  I find the accused in his cross-examination did not prevaricate in answering questions, nor did he attempt to avoid answering questions.  The accused presented as an impressive witness in the witness box.  However in considering the accused's evidence I have regard to the answer which I found to be a deliberate lie in the ERISP regarding the horse whip.
As I indicated I find the answer regarding the horse whip to be a deliberate lie.  As a consequence of my finding my assessment of the accused's credit is adversely affected and I have doubts about his reliability as a witness.  I direct myself in finding a doubt about the accused's reliability that that has not in any way enhanced my assessment of the reliability of the complainant's evidence.
In coming to my verdicts I have weighed up and considered all the evidence in the case and indicate that if I had not found the accused to have told the deliberate lie I would still have found the complainant to be a witness of truth.  I found her evidence to be compelling and to have had the ring of truth about it concerning the allegations of sexual misconduct by the accused.  I still would have found the complainant to be a reliable witness"".
GROUNDS 1 AND 2:  COUNTS 2, 6 AND 8 IN THE INDICTMENT FAILED TO ALLEGE AN OFFENCE KNOWN TO THE LAW OR ALTERNATIVELY ARE BAD FOR DUPLICITY
25These grounds arise out of legislative changes that occurred in the period, 19 October 1990 to 30 April 1991, to which these counts relate.  The counts use the language of s 61E(1A) of the Crimes Act 1900.  This section is referred to in each count immediately after the statement of the factual elements of the offences charged. 
26Section 61E (together with other sections) was repealed by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1989 which was operative from 17 March 1991.  That amending Act also, inter alia, enacted s 61M which provided for an offence of aggravated indecent assault, as well as s 61L which provided for a basic offence of indecent assault.  
27On appeal, it was common ground between the parties that, as is often the case in trials for sexual offences, the evidence did not prove when, in the period to which the counts related, the offences charged were committed, with the consequence that it did not demonstrate whether those offences were committed before or after the legislative changes effective from 17 March 1991.
28The appellant accepted that the words of each count were sufficient to allege an offence against either s 61E(1A) or s 61M but contended that the counts did not allege an offence known to law (because neither of the statutory provisions covered the whole of the period referred to in the counts) or, alternatively, were bad for duplicity (because two different offences were alleged within the one count).  The appellant also submitted that the findings of guilty were uncertain, and should be quashed, because it cannot be determined, from examination of the Indictment and the findings of the trial judge, of which offences the appellant was found guilty.  
29The Crown's response was that the conduct of the appellant charged in the relevant counts was unlawful at all times in the period referred to (until 17 March 1991 under s 61E(1A) and thereafter under s 61M, as well as s 61L) and the fact that the source of the unlawfulness changed did not invalidate the appellant's convictions.  For the reasons that appear below, I consider that the Crown's contentions are correct and that Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 should be rejected.  In my view, the decision of this Court in R v MAJW [2007] NSWCCA 145; 171 A Crim R 407 requires that conclusion and must be followed.  In any event, the reasoning in MAJW is to be preferred to that in the decision upon which the appellant principally relied, Kailis v R [1999] WASCA 29; 21 WAR 100 (reported as K v R in 107 A Crim R 195).
30The statutory provisions to which I have referred are as follows:
""61E   Sexual assault category 4-indecent assault and act of indecency
...
(1A) Any person who assaults another person who:
(a) is under the age of 16 years, and(b) is (whether generally or at the time of the assault only) under the authority of the person,
and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency upon or in the presence of the other person, shall be liable to penal servitude for 6 years.
...
61L   Indecent assault
Any person who assaults another person and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 5 years.
61M   Aggravated indecent assault
(1) Any person who assaults another person in circumstances of aggravation, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.
(2) Any person who assaults another person, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 10 years, if the other person is under the age of 10 years.
(3) In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which:
(a) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or(b) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years, or(c) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or(d) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or(e) the alleged victim has an intellectual disability.""
31In MAJW, the trial judge referred to this Court questions of law which included the following:
""Counts 11 and 12 on the indictment alleged that, between 26 January 2003 and 25 December 2003, the respondent had sexual intercourse with the victim, a person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, namely 12 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the victim was under the authority of the respondent.
On 16 November 2006, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of 14 of the 15 counts on the indictment, including counts 9-12.
Section 66C of the Crimes Act 1900 [sexual intercourse - child between 10 and 16] was inserted in the Act in 1985.
Since 13 June 2003 s 66C (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 provides:
Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years in circumstances of aggravation is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.
Prior to 13 June 2003 s 66C (2) provided:
Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who - 
(a) is of or above the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years; and(b) is (whether generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only) under the authority of the person,shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years.""
32Section 66C(5), which was operative from 13 June 2003, defined ""circumstances of aggravation"" to include the alleged victim being ""under the authority of the alleged offender"".
33James J (with whom Rothman and Harrison JJ agreed) concluded in relation to an argument analogous to that put in the present case:
""27 With regard to counts 11 and 12, it is true that the extended period alleged in each count straddles two periods in which there were different maximum penalties. However, in such a case, if the Crown is unable to establish that the offence was committed during the period in which the higher maximum penalty applied, the offender must be sentenced on the basis of the lower maximum penalty. Difficulties could arise in a case where the Crown charges an aggravated offence, if the circumstance relied on by the Crown was a circumstance of aggravation in one period but not in the other, but such a difficulty does not arise, and need not be addressed, in the present case.""
34This conclusion is applicable to the present case because in that case, as here, whilst the factual matters alleged would, if proved, have constituted offences under both legislative provisions, the provisions were differently framed and specified a different penalty.  
35In MAJW, the earlier version of s 66C(2) referred to persons under the age of 16 years whereas the later referred to persons under 14 years.  Further, the earlier version contained the element of authority within it whereas the later version was structured differently in referring to ""circumstances of aggravation"" and requiring reference to another subsection for the definition of that expression.  That definition referred not only to the victim being under the authority of the alleged offender but to other circumstances of aggravation, none of which were referred to in the earlier version of s 66C(2).  
36James J did not consider these differences to be of significance.  The qualification he stated concerning circumstances of aggravation is not applicable in the present case (nor was it in that case) as the aggravating feature (the victim being under the authority of the alleged offender) was provided for in both statutory provisions.
37In MAJW Rothman J made additional observations including the following:
""55 Ultimately whether it is permissible to charge an offence of this kind in these circumstances must be answered on the basis of two fundamental concerns. The first of them is that the defendant is entitled to be treated fairly and to have a fair hearing. In other words, the defendant must know precisely the facts that are sought to be proven against him and how, if at all, those facts may be met. In the present proceedings, this is easily done. The elements of each offence, as particularised in the indictment, are identical. The only distinction is the sentence that is capable of being imposed. Where the finding of guilt does not allow a discrimination as to which of the two offences apply, the lesser sentence is applicable.
...
61 ... There is no unfairness in giving effect to the clear purpose of the legislature that a person charged (and convicted) of sexual intercourse with a person of 14 years of age during a period that spanned 13 June 2003, in circumstances of aggravation, may be convicted of an offence under section 66C of the Crimes Act, the penalty for which must, in the present circumstances, be the lower of the offence available before and after 13 June 2003.""
38There was similarly no unfairness to the appellant in the present case.  The essential factual ingredients of the charges against the appellant were stated in the Indictment (see John L Pty Ltd v Attorney General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42; 163 CLR 508 at 519 - 20) and he does not complain that he was misled by the manner in which he was tried.  Whilst under s 61M, the age of the victim and the alleged offender's position of authority are two of a number of possible circumstances of aggravation, those matters were necessary elements of an offence under s 61E(1A).  Proof of the elements of an offence under s 61E(1A) therefore established that circumstances of aggravation as defined in s 61M existed.
39It was not essential to the validity of the relevant counts of the Indictment that the statutory provision that rendered the appellant's conduct unlawful be identified, although identification for an accused of a statutory provision or provisions on which the Crown relies may be required as a matter of particulars, to ensure that the accused can adequately prepare for his trial (as to which see Lodhi v R [2006] NSWCCA 121; 199 FLR 303 at [104]).
40In R v Loewenthal; ex parte Blacklock [1974] HCA 36; 131 CLR 338, an accused was charged with having wilfully and unlawfully destroyed property.  The Indictment did not state that the charge was laid under s 469 of the Criminal Code (Qld) but that section was noted in the margin beside the allegation of the factual elements of the offence.  On demurrer, the accused contended that the section was inconsistent with s 29 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and was accordingly invalidated by s 109 of the Constitution.  The High Court upheld this argument but nevertheless held that the District Court had jurisdiction to proceed on the Indictment upon the basis, as identified by Mason J (with whom Barwick CJ agreed), that the language in which the Indictment was expressed was equally apt to allege an offence under s 29 of the Crimes Act as well as an offence under s 469 of the Criminal Code (at 344) and:
""There is therefore no reason why the indictment should have been regarded on its face as alleging an offence against State law only and why it should not have been read as alleging an offence against Commonwealth law"" (at 345).
41Likewise in the present case, the terms in which Counts 2, 6 and 8 of the Indictment were stated were equally apt to charge offences under the former s 61E(1A) and the later enacted s 61M.  No question of duplicity arises because there is no overlap in the periods for which the sections operated.  Thus the counts did not charge that the conduct was an offence under both sections at the same time and therefore alleged two offences in a single count.  
42Part 75 r 3D(1) of the Supreme Court Rules 1970, provides that an indictment may be in the form prescribed which includes reference to the statutory provision, if any, under which a charge is brought.  Rule 3D(2A) requires an indictment to specify the Law Part Code, if any, for each offence alleged in the indictment to have been committed.  However r 3D(2) provides that non-compliance with sub-rules 1 or 2A does not render an indictment bad or insufficient.  These provisions would justify an approach being taken in the present case similar to that taken by Studdert J in Wehbee v Voulgarakis (Supreme Court of New South Wales 22 October 1991, unreported, (1991) 9 Petty Sessions Review 4363) where his Honour found a Local Court information to be valid in accordance with the now repealed Justices Act 1902 where it alleged an offence under the Police Regulations Act 1899 which had been repealed but replaced by later legislation in relevantly the same terms.
43The inessentiality of identification in an indictment of the source of unlawfulness of the offence alleged is reflected in the terms of s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which allows this Court to find an appellant guilty of an offence of which he or she has not in terms been charged if it appears to the Court from the jury's verdict that it must have been satisfied of facts that proved the appellant guilty of that other offence. 
44I turn now to other authorities that the parties cited in argument.
45In R v Page (Court of Criminal Appeal, 25 November 1991, unreported), Campbell J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Mahoney JA agreed) said, in considering the possibility of this Court exercising its powers under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, that it was not possible to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offences which were the subject of convictions that were set aside had occurred at a time during the charged period when new statutory provisions had come into force.  This was important in that case, unlike the position in the present case, because the same elements did not appear in the new provisions, in the case of one count because the new provision contained an age range and in the case of the others because consent was potentially relevant under the new provision.  Hence the verdicts of guilty (there of a jury) did not establish that all the elements of the new offences had been established.
46In Kailis v R, the position was similar to the present:  a statutory provision was amended in the period of time charged on the indictment.  Malcolm CJ (with whom Ipp and Anderson JJ agreed) held that an offence under the new statutory provision was ""technically, a different offence"" from that under the provision that it replaced ""notwithstanding that the same conduct rendered an offender liable to the same punishment"" (at [41]).  His Honour held that the relevant counts were bad for duplicity because ""two separate and distinct offences were alleged in both of [the relevant] counts"" (at [42]).
47His Honour also held that other counts, where the relevant statutory provision was repealed and replaced, were even more clearly bad for duplicity ""as the offences were constituted by entirely different provisions.  Notwithstanding that the basic elements of each offence remained the same, they were, nonetheless, different offences"" (at [56]).  His Honour further held that each of the convictions was uncertain because there was no way of determining of which of the possible offences the appellant was convicted (at [67]).  
48Ipp J's observations concerning the finding of uncertainty of the convictions included the following:
""174 ... An act or omission only renders a person liable to punishment if it is proscribed by the Code and the Code stipulates the particular penalty that a court may impose in respect thereof. As it was put by Lord Mackay LC in R v Mandair [1995] 1 AC 208 at 216: ' ... it is guilt of a contravention of the statute that gives the court power to impose punishment.' It follows that the court's power to impose a sentence for the offence charged under count (1) depended on proof either that the old or the new s 189 had been contravened. Without such proof, the court had no power to punish the appellant.
175 Accordingly, the date of the act alleged bore an essential relation to the charge: cf R v Jacobs [1993] 2 Qd R 541 at 542, per Derrington J. Without proof that the conduct alleged in count (1) occurred before the repeal of the old s 189, it could not be said that that section was contravened. A similar result follows without proof that such conduct occurred after the coming into force of the new s 189. Such proof was not forthcoming. Therefore, it is not possible to know whether the jury convicted the appellant of an offence under the new or the old s 189 and the jury's verdict is uncertain. Accordingly, the appellant was deprived of the chance of acquittal that was fairly open: see S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266 at 276; KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417 at 423, 426.""
49It follows from what I have said earlier that I respectfully disagree with the reasoning in Kailis concerning duplicity as there, like the present situation, the conduct in which the Crown alleged that the accused had engaged could not, under any one count, constitute an offence under more than one statutory provision as only one relevant provision was operative at any particular time.  
50I also disagree with the conclusion that the counts were bad for uncertainty.  The jury's verdicts related to the factual circumstances alleged against the accused.  The statutory provision that justified the imposition of punishment remained for identification by the sentencing judge.  As indicated in MAJW, where punishment is authorised by one or other of two statutory provisions and the court cannot determine with certainty which is applicable, that which provides for the lesser punishment is to be applied.  
51The same comments are applicable to the obiter observations of Olsson J (with which Doyle CJ and Duggan J agreed) in Question of Law Reserved (No 2 of 1996) (1996) 88 A Crim R 417 at 433.  These observations were to the same effect as the reasoning in Kailis.  
52In R v Greenaway [2000] NSWCCA 368; 118 A Crim R 299, the applicant sought leave to appeal against his conviction of an offence described by the Court as an offence under s 81 of the Crimes Act 1900 of indecent assault upon a male.  The terms of the relevant count in the Indictment are not set out in the judgment but it appears that they must have followed the terms of s 81, which before its repeal in 1984, stated:
""Whosoever commits an indecent assault upon a male person of whatever age with or without the consent of such person, shall be liable to penal servitude for five years"".  
53The applicant challenged his conviction on this count on the basis that, in the midst of the period of time in which the count alleged that the relevant conduct occurred, s 81 was replaced by s 78Q of the Crimes Act and the evidence did not establish whether the conduct alleged occurred before or after that legislative change.  The subsequently repealed s 78Q provided:
""78Q   Acts of gross indecency
(1) Any male person who commits, or is a party to the commission of, an act of gross indecency with a male person under the age of 18 years shall be liable to imprisonment for 2 years.
(2) Any person who solicits, procures, incites or advises any male person under the age of 18 years to commit or to be a party to the commission of an act of homosexual intercourse, or an act of gross indecency, with a male person shall be liable to imprisonment for 2 years.""
54The Crown conceded that it was not possible to say whether an offence had been committed under the repealed provision or under the new provision and that the conviction should accordingly be set aside, the Court's attention having been drawn to the decisions in Page and Kailis.  The Court acted on this concession and set aside the conviction.
55It is apparent that in that case, unlike the present, the wording of the relevant count, whilst sufficient to allege an offence under the earlier legislative provision, would not have been sufficient to allege an offence under the later one.  The earlier related to ""an indecent assault"" upon a male person of any age, whereas the latter related to ""gross indecency"" with or toward a male person under the age of 18 years.  Thus a verdict of guilty in relation to the count would not have indicated that the essential ingredients of the later offence were established.  As I have noted earlier, the position is different in the present case as the appellant concedes that the words of each relevant count are sufficient to allege an offence under either the former provision or the later provision (written submissions [62]).  For these reasons Greenaway is distinguishable from the present case.  
56In R v D, WD [2013] SASCFC 32; 116 SASR 99, the appellant was convicted of engaging in two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse at the same time in a 26 month period.  The relevant statutory provision was amended during that period to relate to sexual intercourse with a person of or above the age of 14 years, as opposed to the former requirement of being of or above 12 years, and under the age of 17 years.  As the allegation had been that the victim was of the age of 13 or 14 years, the verdict in a judge alone trial did not indicate that the essential ingredients stated in the amended provision had been established.  As the evidence did not indicate when in the 26 month period the offence occurred, the convictions under these counts were set aside.  This case is distinguishable from the present case on the same basis as Greenaway.
57A further issue raised in R v D, WD was whether the South Australian Full Court was authorised by a local provision comparable to s 7(2) of the New South Wales Criminal Appeal Act to substitute convictions for basic offences of indecent assault in view of the setting aside of the convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse.  The Court held that it was, notwithstanding that the statutory provision relating to indecent assault had been amended during the relevant period.  The Court considered that it did not matter that the structure of the offence had changed from an offence with a possible circumstance of aggravation to two offences, one being a basic offence and one being an aggravated offence.  It said that there had been no change to the elements of the basic offence or its maximum penalty during the whole of the relevant period.  This reasoning is consistent with my reasoning in the present case.
58For these reasons, I consider the decision in MAJW to be authoritative so far as this Court is concerned.  For the reasons I have given, I do not in any event regard the reasoning in the conflicting Western Australian decision in Kailis as persuasive.
GROUND 3:  THE CONDUCT ALLEGED IN COUNT 2 WAS THE SAME CONDUCT ALLEGED IN COUNT 3
59In its opening at the trial, the Crown said that Counts 2, 3 and 4 in the Indictment were part of the one episode, Count 2 involving the touching of CD's vagina, Count 3 its digital penetration and Count 4 penile/vaginal intercourse.  
60CD's evidence in support of Counts 2 and 3 was as follows:
""Q. Did he ever touch your vagina during or before this incident [the penile/vaginal intercourse]?A. Before.  Q. How?A. He just rubbed - he put his fingers inside of me"".
61The trial judge found that Counts 2 and 3 had been established.  The argument put by the appellant on appeal that CD's evidence did not establish two different items of conduct was not put to his Honour, nor was the topic broached in the cross-examination of CD.  
62In my view, it was clearly open to the trial judge to take the view that CD's evidence established that prior to the penile/vaginal intercourse, two separate acts occurred, one of the appellant rubbing CD in the vicinity of her vagina and the other in inserting his fingers inside her vagina.  The appellant suggests that in saying ""he put his fingers inside of me"", CD may have been correcting the statement she had just made that ""[h]e just rubbed"".  The transcript does not indicate this and as the point was not taken at the trial and no application was made to amend the transcript, the appellant is left without support for this proposed ground of appeal.
GROUND 4:  THE TRIAL JUDGE SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED CERTAIN EVIDENCE OF CD'S BROTHER AS IT WAS NOT CHALLENGED
63The evidence in question is that of CD's brother that when he, his siblings and the appellant visited the Gold Coast, they stayed in the Imperial Surf Hotel.  This evidence was significant because the effect of a statement of Agreed Facts tendered at the trial was that that building ""has"" two bedroom units only (save for one presently irrelevant exception).  As noted above at [21], the number of bedrooms in the unit in which the family stayed was relevant to the appellant's opportunity to engage in the conduct which CD alleged took place there.
64The brother was called to give evidence in the Crown's case.  His relevant evidence-in-chief was as follows:
""Q. Do you remember the place you went to in Queensland?A. Yeah, The Imperial Surf.
Q. Why do you remember the name of--A. Sorry?  Just I remember the enormous building right across the, basically walking past Club Surfers right on the beach--
Q. Okay.A. --and I think it was also near that rocket - bungy rocket thing as well so--
Q. Do you know on what floor you went to, to stay?A. I, I, I remember it was very high up but I, I couldn't tell you the exact floor, no.
Q. What about the size of the apartment or unit?A. I don't remember real bedrooms [sic].  I remember the open plan living area and I remember the balcony, but that's really about all I - I couldn't tell you how many bedrooms there were or anything like that, no"".
65He mentioned the name of the apartment block again, later in his evidence-in-chief.  No reference to the name of the apartment block was made in his cross-examination by the appellant's counsel but he did repeat then that he could not remember how many bedrooms were in the unit in which the family stayed.
66In his evidence at the trial, the appellant said that when interviewed earlier by the police he had not been able to recall the name of the apartment block but had subsequently ascertained it by a Google search.  He said that he was able to identify it because of its location and shape.  Later, he said that there were ""hundreds"" of high rise apartment blocks in the vicinity of or along the The Esplanade which was the street upon which the Imperial Surf was located.  The appellant does not contend that this evidence of the appellant, as distinct from that of CD's brother, should have been accepted by reason of an absence of challenge to it. 
67In re-examination, the appellant said that he had had experience with major real estate transactions and had identified the Imperial Surf by reason of its distinctive structure.   
68In the course of the Crown's final address, the following exchange occurred:
""CROWN PROSECUTOR:  ... The Gold Coast incident, there was, it seems, a concession - if that's not the right word, acknowledgement might be better - as to parts of the layout of the unit being consistent with the evidence elsewhere led, including in the accused case that the unit was a two and not a three bedroom unit, which she had alleged.
HIS HONOUR:  Well, she maintained her position.  She said she believed it to be a three bedroom unit.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes.  But she acknowledged that part of some of the layout, including entrance area and so forth, appeared to recall - in other words, what was put to her in cross-examination was consistent with her recall of the layout, but she maintained that she thought it was a three bedroom unit.
HIS HONOUR:  Well, I have some doubts about what unit block it was.  There's no material before me apart from the judgment of the accused.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes.
HIS HONOUR:  I don't know whether that takes it very much further.  [CD's brother] didn't remember.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  No.  Although [CD's brother] does recall seeing - and this is perhaps the only evidence, although it's somewhat peripheral perhaps for your Honour - but [CD's brother] recalled seeing CD sleeping on the lounge at The Imperial Surf.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.  Well, that's consistent with her evidence"" (emphasis added).
69In the course of the appellant's counsel's final address, the following exchange occurred concerning the Gold Coast apartment block:
""HIS HONOUR:  Well, perhaps I could indicate to you I have to rely on the evidence of the accused in relation to the accommodation, so we can't take the accommodation as a given and--
BODOR:  Well, your Honour, may I - I hear your Honour.  I'll try and address it.
HIS HONOUR:  If I accept the accused as a witness of truth, even then I can't be totally satisfied that the property [w]as The Imperial Surf.  He's given evidence that there were scores of high-rise buildings on The Esplanade.
BODOR:  Yes, I understand that, your Honour.  May I trust [sic] and address it seriatim?
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.
BODOR:  It is an agreed fact - exhibit F, 13 to 16 - that there was such a building with such an altitude.  The accused, in his ERISP, when first confronted about that - so I'll go back to the agreed facts. The inquiry as to the existence of the high-rise complex revealed that there is a Breakfree Imperial Surf.  I think the accused called it The Imperial Surf.  It has two bedrooms and it's only for guests, save for the penthouse on the 35th, and the complex was operating in 1994.  They are the agreed facts, essentially, on the point.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.
BODOR:  The accused, in his ERISP, says that he stayed at a high-rise on the 25th floor, which is important, in my submission, and he said he made arrangements for a trundle type of bed.  That, in itself, has about it a ring of truth that there would need to be five beds for the five occupants, that is the three girls and the two boys.  He said that the arrangement was that the girls were to sleep in one room and he and [CD's brother] in the smaller room.  The essence of it was that CD was not prepared to sleep in there on his account and she slept on the sofa.  The evidence in the trial was, from CD, [CD's brother] and the accused, that she slept on the sofa.
The important material in the trial, in my submission, on that contextual context is - sorry, [CD's brother] confirmed, at 399, that they were at The Imperial Surf and he told the police that--
HIS HONOUR:  I don't know what he told the police.  It's what he told me is what's--
BODOR:  Sorry, he was cross-examined about the fact that he told the police - at 399, please, and 402 - that he was on the 25th floor.
HIS HONOUR:  So he was, what, 18 at the time?
BODOR:  17 or 18.  He was on his Ls; we know that.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, and we're talking about something that happened 18 years ago.
BODOR:  We're talking 18 years ago, yes.
HIS HONOUR:  He remembered he was staying on the 25th floor, which so happens to be the same floor that his father said he was--
BODOR:  Your Honour, for a tribunal of fact there's always an inquisitive mind.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.
BODOR:  There can always be an element of - and I'm not offending when I say this.  There can always be an element of cynicism but, at the end of the day, in my submission, you ought not reject material--
HIS HONOUR:  No, I'm not rejecting.  I'm not rejecting it.
BODOR:  I was going to say you ought not reject material simply because it doesn't accord with a reaction rather than other evidence.  If there was evidence A and B, then you would have to choose or--
HIS HONOUR:  Well, there is evidence A and B because the complainant believes, and it was said in her evidence, that - even when she was confronted with the diagram that she still believed it was a three-bedroom unit.  So there is conflicting evidence.
BODOR:  I'll go to that. She vacillated about it.
HIS HONOUR:  No, her last answer was she believed it was a three-bedroom unit"" (emphasis added).
70Following this exchange, the appellant's counsel continued to assert that the appellant's evidence on this issue should be accepted, with the trial judge at one point saying ""If it was The Imperial Surf then obviously it's just a two bedroom unit"" (emphasis added).
71The trial judge's decision included the following concerning CD's brother's evidence on this issue:
""[CD's brother] in his evidence in chief gave evidence the family stayed at the Imperial Surf Hotel in January 1994.  However in cross-examination by Mr Bodor, [CD's brother] gave evidence that he told police in his statement that the family stayed in 'a hotel which was the tallest tower'.  I make the comment that it is curious indeed as to how [CD's brother's] memory improved regarding the name of the building from the time of his police statement to the time he gave evidence in court and indicate that I have significant doubt about [CD's brother's] evidence regarding the family staying specifically at the Imperial Surf in 1994"".
72His Honour then referred to the appellant's evidence on the issue and indicated that he was not satisfied that CD's evidence that she believed the unit to have been three bedroom was incorrect.  
73On appeal, the appellant complains that CD's brother was not challenged on how he recalled the name of the apartment block and ""it was not suggested to defence counsel or the Crown that [his] evidence as to the name of the Hotel might be rejected"".  However the brother was the Crown's witness and therefore not able to be questioned by the Crown as if the Crown were cross-examining him in the absence of leave to do so being granted to it under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.  In my view it was sufficient for the Crown to ask the brother in evidence, as it did, why he remembered the name, as it was clear from the course of the trial that whether the apartment block was the Imperial Surf Hotel was in issue because a finding that it was would arguably have required the conclusion that the unit in which the family stayed had only two bedrooms (although a further point remained that the agreed fact concerning the Imperial Surf Hotel was that its units presently had two bedrooms, without any agreement or evidence as to the position in 1994).  This was reflected in his Honour's observation in argument that ""If it was the Imperial Surf then obviously it's just a two bedroom unit"".
74The appellant emphasises his Honour's statement in argument ""no, I'm not rejecting.  I'm not rejecting it"" but that seems to have been said in relation to the evidence concerning the floor number rather than the building name.  Moreover, it would be reading too much into the statement to construe it as an indication that the trial judge was binding himself not to reject the evidence in the course of his final judgment.  The comment was simply one, in the course of what was obviously vigorous discussion between the bench and bar, indicating that the judge was not making a decision on the issue at that stage.  Counsel's conduct in continuing to address on the issue supports that view, as does the judge's later statement that ""If it was The Imperial Surf ... "".
75In my view, contrary to the appellant's contention, what occurred did not constitute a failure to afford him procedural fairness.  The appellant's counsel was aware from the interchanges during the addresses that the number of bedrooms in the Gold Coast apartment, and therefore the name of the block in which it was situated, remained in issue (see MWJ v R [2005] HCA 74; 80 ALJR 329 at [38]).  If he perceived any unfairness in the Crown not having made an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act to question CD's brother as if in cross-examination, it was open to him to seek leave to further cross-examine the brother, but he did not do so.  Nor did he suggest in address that the issues were foreclosed by the absence of any such application by the Crown.
76The appellant further submits that the basis for the trial judge's ""significant doubt"" with respect to the brother's evidence (see [71] above) was not put to him or the parties.  This is again answered by the fact that the name of the apartment block was in issue.  The comment made by the trial judge concerning the improvement in the brother's memory between the time of his police statement and his evidence at the trial was a comment based upon the brother's evidence at the trial.  It was an understandable and obvious observation pertinent to the reliability of the brother's evidence on this issue.  The judge was not impugning the brother's honesty (compare Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd [2011] HCA 11; 243 CLR 361 at [71] and see Douglass v R [2012] HCA 34; 86 ALJR 1086 at [15] as to the distinction between truthfulness and reliability) and nothing more was required to be put to him during his evidence.
77For these reasons, this ground of appeal should be rejected.
GROUND 5:  THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN HIS TREATMENT OF THE CONTEXT EVIDENCE
78In support of this ground of appeal, the appellant submitted:
""104. In essence, it was necessary for his Honour to assess the combined force of the evidence which tended to show that the complainant was not reliable in her accounts of the alleged misconduct in Victoria and Queensland (and indeed any other evidence of unreliability).  His Honour was then required to take into account any doubt he may then have experienced with respect to the alleged incidents in Victoria and Queensland in relation to the charged offences.  His Honour, it is submitted, failed to do so.  As a consequence, it is respectfully submitted his Honour erred in this regard"" (Written Submissions dated 24 April 2013).
79The evidentiary matters to which the appellant referred in relation to this submission were:
CD's erroneous evidence as to when and where the first (uncharged) sexual assault occurred (the ""Warrandyte allegation"").  The trial judge found this affected CD's credibility ""only to a minor degree"" (see [18] above).CD's incorrect evidence concerning the Melbourne trip (see [19] above).  Again, the trial judge found that this affected CD's credit only to a minor degree.Inconsistency between CD's evidence of sexual conduct occurring on the Melbourne trip and her description of that conduct in her police statement.  The trial judge found that CD's credibility was not adversely affected by these differences (see [20] above).The trial judge's allegedly erroneous assessment of the Gold Coast trip allegations, as a result of his treatment of the evidence of CD's brother (see [21] above).
80The appellant submitted that the combined force of the evidence concerning the Warrandyte, Gold Coast and Melbourne allegations was significant as they were occasions in respect of which the appellant was able to put some detailed propositions to CD, with the result that her evidence was found wanting.  The appellant contrasted this to the position in relation to the allegations in the Indictment which were not able to be tested in the same detailed fashion.
81I reject this ground of appeal.  The attention the appellant's counsel devoted at the trial to the Warrandyte, Gold Coast and Melbourne evidence of CD, both in his cross-examination of CD and in his questions in chief to the appellant, left no doubt that the appellant's case was that CD's evidence on these context matters was unreliable, resulting in a significant, adverse effect on her credibility and the reliability of her evidence concerning the charged conduct.  The attention given by the trial judge to these matters in his judgment reflected that focus, as did his observations in his judgment as to the extent, if any, to which they affected his assessment of CD's credibility and reliability.  
82As the appellant's counsel acknowledged at the commencement of his closing address at the trial, the trial judge was a very experienced judge, having sat on the District Court for almost 30 years and, according to the appellant's counsel, having done ""hundreds and hundreds of jury trials and probably dozens of judge alone trials"".  The proposition that his Honour failed to appreciate that the evidence concerning the alleged uncharged sexual misconduct in Victoria and Queensland was of significance, both when taken as evidence of individual incidents and as a whole, is untenable and is belied by the attention his Honour devoted to those issues in his judgment.  
GROUND 6:  THE FINDINGS OF GUILT WERE UNREASONABLE
83This ground seeks to invoke the Court's power under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to set aside a verdict on the ground that ""it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".  The subsection refers to the verdict of a jury but s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that a judge's finding of guilt in a judge alone trial has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.  The Crown did not contend that s 6(1) was inapplicable.
84Determination of such a ground requires this Court to review the record of the trial and to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" to enable it to answer the ""central question"" of whether this Court is satisfied that the appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offences of which he was convicted (SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14] and [20].  For the reasons following, the review and assessment that I have made lead me to answer this question in the affirmative.
85The Crown case was based almost wholly upon CD's evidence.  Accordingly, acceptance of her honesty and reliability was crucial to the success of its case.  The trial judge had the advantage over this Court in seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence and the opportunity over the 12 day period during which the trial took place ""to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole"" (Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at [23]; and see Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [41]; SKA at [13]; Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59; 246 CLR 469 at [29]).  Notwithstanding the need for an appellate court dealing with a ground such as the present to review the whole of the record of the case, the trial judge retains an advantage in having experienced the ""feeling"" of a case which an appellate court does not necessarily always fully share (Fox v Percy at [23]).
86Accordingly, respect must be given to the trial judge's findings of guilt which form part of the record of the trial required to be reviewed by this Court (Weiss at [43]).  This is particularly so where the judge's decision reveals a thorough examination of the evidence and specific challenges to the judge's reasoning, made by the grounds of appeal addressed earlier, have been rejected.  
87Having read the whole of CD's evidence, and the other evidence at the trial, I am not left with any reasonable doubt as to the veracity and substantial accuracy of CD's evidence concerning the matters upon which the appellant's convictions were based.  The trial judge's acceptance of her evidence appears to me to have been entirely rational and justified.  Like the trial judge, I would attach limited significance to the errors CD made concerning the Warrandyte and Melbourne allegations and the inconsistencies concerning the latter trip (see [79] above).  Those seem to me to have been matters upon which CD could reasonably have been mistaken or confused without this reflecting adversely on her honesty in giving evidence and the reliability of her recollection of the appellant's sexual abuse of her.  
88Contrary to the appellant's submission, the timing and content of CD's complaints to others of the sexual abuse do not in my view reflect adversely on her honesty and reliability.  Her delay in complaining was well-explained by her stated fear of her father, understandable in light of his proved conduct in horsewhipping her and her evidence of threats of the appellant to use the horsewhip if she disclosed his sexual misconduct.  Further, her initial provision of only limited information to persons to whom she complained reflected an understandable reluctance to speak of the detail of what had been done to her.  
GROUND 7:  WHEN SENTENCING THE APPELLANT WITH RESPECT TO COUNTS 2, 6 AND 8, THE TRIAL JUDGE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT AGGRAVATING FACTORS THAT WARRANTED CONVICTION FOR A MORE SERIOUS OFFENCE CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE IN R v DI SIMONI [1981] 147 CLR 383
89By his sentencing judgment of 8 March 2013, the trial judge imposed an aggregate sentence, under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, of imprisonment for 12 years, with a non-parole period of seven years and each period to date from 14 December 2012.  As required by s 53A(2)(b), his Honour stated indicative sentences in respect of each of the offences, being two years for counts 3 and 10, four years for counts 4 and 7 and one year in relation to each of the remaining seven counts upon which the appellant was convicted.
90His Honour assessed the sentences in respect of counts 2, 6 and 8 under s 61L which provides for the basic (that is, unaggravated) offence of indecent assault and specifies a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.  For the s 66C(2) offences (sexual intercourse with a child between the age and 10 and 16 under the authority of the offender) his Honour indicated sentences of four years and two years, the maximum penalty being 10 years imprisonment.
91The appellant contended in relation to this ground of appeal that, in indicating sentences in relation to counts 2, 6 and 8, the trial judge, contrary to R v Di Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383, took into account matters of aggravation that would have warranted the appellant's conviction for more serious offences.  In particular, the appellant referred to his Honour's references in that context to the appellant's young age, ""a gross abuse of the trust which reposed in [the appellant] as a father"" and earlier prevailing sentencing practices for offences involving complainants of young age and breaches of relationships of trust. 
92The Crown accepted that the appellant had established error in this respect but submitted that the application for leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence imposed by the trial judge should be dismissed as no less severe sentence ""is warranted in law and should have been passed"" (s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act).  
93The facts upon which the trial judge proceeded in relation to these counts were as follows:
""COUNTS 2, 3 AND 4
The victim commenced Year 7 in 1991 at The Hills Grammar School and counts 2, 3 and 4 occurred approximately one week after the victim attended a slumber party and following on from the victim getting her first period.
On the evening between 19 October 1990 and 30 April 1991 whilst the family was living at Kenthurst the offender again entered the victim's bedroom.
The offender told the victim he was going to 'show her how to be a good wife'.  The offender touched and rubbed the victim's vagina (count 2) before digitally penetrating her with what the victim believed to be two fingers 'because it hurt' (count 3).
The offender then got undressed and removed the victim's tracksuit pants as well as her underpants.  The victim was lying on her back and the offender prised her legs open with his own legs before fully penetrating her vagina with his erect penis (count 4).  The incident hurt the victim and it continued for a period of time which the victim described as feeling like 'forever'.  The offender ejaculated inside the victim.
The victim was directed by the offender to look into his eyes during the act of penetration.  She recalled him saying 'it felt good'.
The victim was twelve years old at the time and had commenced to mature physically.  She said the experience made her feel 'sort of numb ... I didn't feel anything ... I felt like someone else'.
The offender was forty-two years of age at the time.
COUNTS 6, 7 AND 8
On an occasion after the events comprising counts 2, 3 and 4 the victim and the offender were in a spa bath together which was situated near the main bedroom.  It was a warm day and the victim had earlier been swimming in the pool.  Initially she was by herself in the spa before the offender came and joined her and he was naked when he entered the spa.
The offender got undressed and instructed the victim to rub his penis 'up and down'.  The victim did as she was told.  The [offender's] penis became erect and he was guiding her hand at the time (count 6).
The offender then told the victim that he wanted to put his erect penis in her mouth. The victim sat between the offender's legs on the steps within the spa.  The offender placed his erect penis into her mouth causing the victim to gag.  She resisted his penis fully entering her mouth.  The offender's penis was in the victim's mouth for approximately ten seconds (count 7).
The offender then got back into the water and instructed the victim to finish masturbating his erect penis which she did (count 8).  The offender ejaculated into the water of the spa and then left.  The whole incident lasted two to three minutes.
The victim was twelve years old at the time of these offences and the offender was forty-two years old"".
94I agree with the Crown's submission that even if one removes from consideration the factors of CD's young age and the appellant's position of authority, the sentences indicated by his Honour in respect of counts 6 and 8 of 1 year imprisonment for each were lenient bearing in mind the specified maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years for each.  Particularly is this so in the case of count 8 which resulted from CD being required to masturbate the appellant to ejaculation after she refused to continue the fellatio the subject of count 7.
95I also consider that the appropriate sentence for count 2 is at least that indicated by his Honour for that count, when viewed on a stand alone basis without regard to issues of concurrency and to the factors of CD's young age and the appellant's position of authority.
96As his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence under s 53A, the question arising out of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is whether any less severe sentence than that aggregate sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed.  As I consider the appropriate sentences in respect of the remaining counts also to be at least those indicated by his Honour, I conclude that no lesser sentence than the aggregate sentence is warranted.
97As the sentence in question here is a single aggregated sentence in respect of all of the offences of which the appellant was convicted, the question of construction s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act discussed in such authorities as Arnaout v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 278; 191 A Crim R 149, McMahon v R [2011] NSWCCA 147 and AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 160 does not arise.  In AB v R, Adams J described that question as follows:
""The issue is whether the sub-section should be read to enable sentences other than that under appeal to be considered, they having been imposed to reflect the total criminality of which the offence applicable to the sentence under appeal is a part, in other words, whether the phrase 'some other sentence' [refers] to the particular sentence under appeal or the overall sentence imposed"" (at [64]).
ORDERS
98For these reasons, the appellant's appeal against his convictions and application for leave to appeal against his sentence should be dismissed.
99ADAMS J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.
100LATHAM J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2762698,R v Hadchiti (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1727,"Ex tempore judgment

 

1The case was opened on the basis that it was the accused who inflicted the fatal injury and that he was assisted in an attack on Billy Mack, immediately he entered the garden at Londonderry. The accused has admitted that it was he who inflicted that fatal wound and in order to meet the Crown case, gave evidence as to the struggle over the knife in which the wound was inflicted in self defence.

 

2In cross-examination, without objection the accused was asked whether it was he or someone else who inflicted the fatal wound. The accused did not depart from his admissions.

 

3In closing address the Crown has submitted that the accused's evidence should not be accepted. Further, that it may not have been the accused who inflicted the fatal wound, but that it may have been inflicted by someone assisting him.

 

4The accused has objected to the case being put on this new basis relying on King v R [1986] HCA 59; (1986) 161 CLR 423, where a new trial was ordered in circumstances where the Crown case was put on a new accessory basis during summing up, on the Crown's application. It seems to me that this is a similar situation. It involves a change in course which is prejudicial to the accused. If it were accepted by the jury, his case on self defence could clearly not be made out.

 

5In the result, it seems to me that if the Crown wishes to press the case against the accused on this new basis, not put to the jury in opening or part of the case statement served on the accused and clearly not the case which the accused set out to meet, that unfair prejudice would result for the accused.

 

6In that event there seems to be three options, the first for the Crown to revisit its address and confine the case to that on which it opened, namely that it was the accused who inflicted the fatal wound and that others were involved in assisting him in the attack on Billy Mack; the second for the jury to be discharged and a new trial ordered; and the third for the Crown to continue, but for me to direct the jury on the basis of the case as originally put. The last option seems only available if it were considered that the resulting prejudice to the accused would not be irreparable.

 

7The parties need to consider how they wish to proceed. In the first instance that is a matter for the Crown to determine.

2762702,Doe v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 248,"Judgment1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J and the orders which he proposes.
2JOHNSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
3BELLEW J: Following a trial by jury the applicant was convicted of the following offences, all of which occurred on 31 January 2004:(i)having sexual intercourse with EH without her consent, knowing that she had not consented (count 1);
(ii)having sexual intercourse with EH without her consent, knowing that she had not consented (count 2);
(iii)having sexual intercourse with EH without her consent, knowing that she had not consented (count 6);
(iv)assaulting EH and at the me of the assault committing an act of indecency on her (count 7); and
(v)having sexual intercourse with EH without her consent, knowing that she had not consented (count 8).
4The offences in counts 1, 2, 6 and 8 were contrary to s. 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment.  The offence in count 7 was contrary to s. 61L of the same Act and carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.  No standard non-parole period is prescribed for that offence.  
5On 13 April 2007 the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Conlon as follows:
(i)in respect of each of counts 1, 6 and 8, a non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment commencing 22 September 2006 and expiring on 21 September 2013, with an additional term of 3 years expiring on 21 September 2016;
(ii)in respect of count 2, a non-parole period of 8 years imprisonment commencing 22 September 2006 and expiring 21 September 2014, with an additional period of imprisonment of 3 years expiring on 21 September 2017;
(iii)in respect of count 7, a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 22 September 2006 and expiring on 21 September 2008, with an additional term of imprisonment of 12 months expiring on 21 September 2009.
6The overall sentence was one of 11 years imprisonment, made up of a non-parole period of 8 years and an additional term of 3 years.  It is noted that the entirety of the sentences which were imposed were ordered to be served concurrently.
7The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  The background to that application is set out in an affidavit of the applicant of 12 September 2013, along with an affidavit of Ruth Chalmers, solicitor, of 13 September 2013.  In short, the applicant lodged a notice of intention to appeal against conviction and sentence in late April 2007.  He was subsequently informed that legal aid would be granted only in respect of an appeal against conviction.  That appeal proceeded and was dismissed by this Court (see Doe v R [2008] NSWCCA 203; (2008) 187 A Crim R 328).  8On 28 November 2012 the applicant conferred with Ms Chalmers who informed him that there was ""likely merit"" in an application for leave to appeal against sentence due to what Ms Chalmers described in her affidavit as a ""Muldrock error"" (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39).  Counsel was then briefed and a notice of application for leave to appeal was filed on 18 July 2013.  In Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 this Court explained in detail the background to, and the general nature of, so-called ""Muldrock errors"".  It is therefore unnecessary for me to do so again.    
9On any view, the delay in the matter is substantial, and a significant extension of time is sought.  The Crown has opposed the granting of an extension of time.  
THE FACTS10The following summary of the facts is taken from the remarks of the sentencing judge.  
11EH (""the victim"") had been socialising with friends on the evening of 30 January 2004.  In the course of walking to a friend's home in the early hours of 31 January she went past a nightclub where she observed two males.  One of them got into a taxi, whilst the other (the applicant) stayed on the kerb.  As the victim walked past the applicant she put her head down but said ""Hi"".  The applicant responded in similar terms and asked the victim where she was going.  The victim told him that she was going to a friend's home, at which point she started to walk faster.  The applicant then caught up to her, put his hand on her back and said ""I'll walk you there"".  
12The victim described herself as being anxious at this point because the applicant persisted in walking with her, saying that he was her ""friend"" and telling her that he wanted to make sure that she reached her friend's place.  The victim described the applicant's presence as ""overpowering"".
13When the victim reached her friend's home, the applicant was still beside her with his hand on her back.  He asked her if she wanted to go to a hotel, and the victim responded that she wanted to go inside.  The applicant repeated his invitation to her to accompany him to a hotel.  Once again, the victim told him that she simply wanted to go inside.  The applicant then grabbed the victim around her waist with his arm, pulled her tightly towards him and kissed her on the open mouth with his tongue. The victim described being kissed ""roughly"" by the applicant whilst being held so tightly that she could not pull away.  She had done nothing to indicate that she wanted the applicant to kiss her.  On the contrary, she had told him on two occasions that she wished to go inside.  
14The offender then suggested that they go to an area across the road, at which time the victim again protested, telling the applicant for a third time that she wanted to go inside.  The applicant then took the victim in what she described as an extremely forceful grip.  He dragged her down the driveway of the premises which adjoined those of her friend to a chicken coop area where he again pulled her towards him and kissed her.
15The applicant then put his hand down the victim's pants and digitally penetrated her vagina with more than one finger.  The victim described that this was done roughly and said that she told the applicant that he was hurting her as he was doing it.  This formed the basis of count 1.
16The offender then pulled the victim's pants down before removing his own pants.  Whilst the victim was facing away from him, the applicant penetrated her anus with his penis.  The victim told the applicant that he was hurting her and repeatedly asked him to use a condom.  She described the applicant using extreme force, and described the pain as excruciating.  This continued for about 5 minutes and the victim said that she did not think that the applicant ejaculated.  This formed the basis of count 2.
17The applicant then laid the victim on the ground and engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse which formed the basis of count 6.  In the course of doing so, the applicant grabbed the victim's left nipple in a manner she described as ""really roughly"".  This formed the basis of count 7.  
18The victim told the applicant that he was hurting her, at which time he ceased having penile/vaginal intercourse with her.  He then placed what the victim described as his ""left hand"" into her vagina, and digitally penetrated her with more than one finger.  This formed the basis of count 8.
19During the course of those acts which formed the basis of counts 6, 7 and 8 the victim told the offender on more than one occasion that what he was doing was hurting her, and pleaded with him to use a condom.  
20The grabbing of the victim's nipple continued until she was able to get up. She ran to her friend's house and knocked on the door. The applicant followed her, carrying her thongs, which he then gave to her before asking her for her telephone number.  The victim's friend then came to the front door of the premises and the victim went inside.  The victim's friend described the victim as sobbing uncontrollably, being short of breath and appearing distraught.  
21The police were then called.  One of the police officers gave evidence that he observed the victim's pants to be bloodstained around the area of the crotch.  Arrangements were then made for the victim to attend Wollongong Hospital where she was medically examined.  She was found to have two grazes/lacerations on her left nipple, each of which was 3 mm long.  Grazes were also found on the lining of her vagina which left bloodstains on the vagina and vulva.  There was also evidence that the victim's right labia minora appeared red and was swollen to twice the size of her right.  There was also swelling and redness to the vaginal entrance, swelling of the perineum and redness and grazing to the lower vaginal wall.  
THE FINDINGS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE22The sentencing judge found (commencing at ROS 14) that the applicant had engaged in a forceful and violent attack upon the victim.  Having made reference to her injuries, his Honour said (commencing at ROS 17):
""Concerning count 1 (digital/vaginal penetration), count 6 (penile/vaginal) and count 8 (digital) I regard each of these offences as falling within the mid range of objective seriousness.  In the circumstances as they related to the present offences I do not consider that the digital penetration as (sic) less serious than the penile penetration"".  
23Having cited the decision of Sully J in R v O [2005] NSWCCA 327 his Honour  then said (at ROS 17):     
""The offender's act of anal intercourse (count 2) was a particularly degrading act, carried out as it was with ""extreme force"" and causing the victim ""excruciating pain"".  I regard this offence as falling above the mid range of objective seriousness"".  
24His Honour then proceeded to consider the applicant's subjective case before imposing the sentences previously outlined.
THE GROUND OF APPEAL His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.The approach taken by the sentencing judge25His Honour said (at ROS 22):
""Section 54A(2) of the (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) provides that the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences included in the table.
Section 54B of the Act provides that the court is to set the standard non-parole period fixed for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is either longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period"".  
26His Honour then made reference (at ROS 24) to the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168:  ""In accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal (sic) in R v Way, one must ask whether reasons exist for not imposing the standard non-parole period.  That question is answered by considering the objective seriousness of the offence in order to determine whether it falls within the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of the relevant kind"".
27His Honour found that the offending in counts 1, 6 and 8 fell in the mid range of objective seriousness.  In respect of count 2  his Honour said (at ROS 27):
""... my assessment is that it falls above the mid range of objective seriousness. ... Where the court is of the view that a matter falls either below or above the mid range of objective seriousness the court is then required to exercise its discretion in accordance with established sentencing practices and by reference to matters identified in s. 3A and s. 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  In such an approach the standard non-parole period is properly a reference point or a guide post along with other relevant extrinsic aids such as the authorities, statistics and the specified maximum penalty"". 
Submissions of the parties28By reference to the passages set out at [25] and [26] above, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour had adopted a two stage approach in sentencing the applicant, contrary to the decision in Muldrock.  The Crown conceded that his Honour's approach in this regard reflected error.    
29However, the Crown's concession did not extend to his Honour's approach in respect of count 2.  The Crown submitted that having found that the offending in count 2 fell above the mid range, the sentencing judge had proceeded to sentence the applicant by taking all relevant matters into account.  The Crown submitted that his Honour's remarks specifically indicated that he had not given the standard non-parole period determinative significance in considering the appropriate sentence in respect of count 2, but that he had (as he expressly stated) used it as a reference point or guide post.  Accordingly, the Crown submitted that there was no error in respect of count 2.
30The Crown further submitted that the conceded error in respect of counts 1, 6 and 8 was immaterial in any event because the sentences imposed for those counts were completely subsumed by the sentence imposed in respect of count 2, in respect of which no error was made out.  In this regard, the Crown relied upon the decision in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at [83].  In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 would not be enlivened even though error had been established. 
Consideration and conclusion31The Crown's concession was, in my view, a proper one.  Those passages of his Honour's sentencing remarks at [25] and [26] above make it clear that his Honour adopted a two stage process of sentencing by identifying the standard non-parole period and by then asking whether there were any factors which justified a departure from it.  In light of the decision in Muldrock, that was an erroneous approach.  
32Equally however, it is evident from that passage of his Honour's sentencing remarks set out in [27] above that his Honour considered count 2 separately from counts 1, 6 and 8.  In doing so, he used the standard non-parole period applicable to count 2 as a reference point and proceeded to sentence the applicant by reference to the matters to which he referred.  Using the standard non-parole period as a guideline, yardstick or reference point, as opposed to giving it primary or determinative significance by using it as a starting point, reflects an approach which is entirely consistent with the decision in Muldrock (see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43] per Johnson J).    
33In these circumstances I do not consider that his Honour erred in his approach to sentencing for count 2.  Moreover, in circumstances where his Honour considered count 2 quite separately from counts 1, 6 and 8, I do not consider that the conceded error in respect of those latter counts  infected his Honour's approach to sentencing in respect of count 2.
34However, I do not accept the Crown's submission that the error in respect of counts 1, 6 and 8 is immaterial.  An error will be material if it has the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  It is the question of that capacity, rather than the outcome, which is the primary consideration (see Baxter (supra) at [83] per Latham J).  In my view, the fundamental nature of the identified error in the present case is a clear indication that it had the capacity to infect the overall sentence imposed.
35It follows that a material error has been made out.
The application to extend time36 In Abdul (supra) this Court said (at [53])
""Accordingly, when considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time"".
37In the present case the delay is substantial.  It is sought to be explained on the basis of a change in applicable sentencing principles following the decision in Muldrock.  A Victim Impact Statement was before the sentencing judge documenting the understandable emotional harm suffered by the victim as a consequence of the applicant's offending.  It is reasonable to infer that the granting of an extension of time may well give rise to added trauma for her. It would also offend the principle of finality.  All of these matters tend against granting an extension of time.
38For the reasons explained in Abdul, because a material error has been established it is necessary to assess the prospects of success of the application for leave to appeal.  In doing so, the Court must consider whether any other sentence is warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s. 6(3)).
Is a lesser sentence warranted in law?Submissions of the parties39 Counsel for the applicant did not take issue with the fact that the offending in an overall sense was objectively serious.  However he submitted that when the counts were assessed individually, it was evident that the objective seriousness of each of them differed.  Whilst acknowledging that the offending in count 2 involved extreme force, caused the victim significant pain,  and extended over some minutes, counsel submitted that in comparison, the offending exhibited in the remaining individual counts was of shorter duration, entailed minimal penetration and was, as a consequence, generally less serious.  In these circumstances, counsel pointed to the fact that the non-parole periods for each of those remaining counts were only separated by one year, a circumstance which, it was submitted, did not reflect the fact that they involved less serious offending when compared to that in count 2.  
40Counsel for the applicant, both in writing and orally, also submitted that because the form of sexual intercourse in counts 1 and 8 was digital penetration, the offending in those counts should be viewed as being less serious than the other forms of forced intercourse which were the subject of counts 2 and 6.  In this regard, counsel relied on the decision in MH v R [2011] NSWCCA 230 which, he submitted, had ""clarified"" the proposition for which he contended.   
41Counsel also relied on the fact that there were a series of mitigating factors in the applicant's favour which, he submitted, had not been given sufficient weight by the sentencing judge.  These included the fact that the offence was essentially opportunistic and not a part of any planned or organised criminal activity, along with the fact that the applicant had no prior convictions.  Counsel also pointed to the evidence which was before the sentencing judge concerning various unfortunate aspects of the applicant's upbringing in Liberia, along with the fact that he was now exhibiting symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder.  In these general respects, counsel also relied upon the affidavit of the applicant of 12 September, in which he deposed to the difficulties he has experienced in custody as a consequence of his ethnicity, and the rehabilitative courses that he has undertaken.  Finally, counsel relied upon statistics issued by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, along with what were said to be cases involving comparable offending.
42The Crown submitted that even if material error were found, no lesser sentence was warranted.  It was submitted that the sentencing judge had accurately described the overall incident as a forceful and violent attack, and one which involved a particularly degrading act of anal intercourse.  
43Although the Crown appeared to accept that as a general proposition digital penetration should be viewed as less serious than penile penetration, it was submitted that the objective seriousness of any offending was to be determined having regard to the entirety of the circumstances.  In the present case the Crown pointed, in particular, to the victim's description of the offending in counts 1 and 8, and to the medical evidence of the injuries she sustained.  In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that merely because those counts involved digital penetration they should not be viewed as less serious than those which did not.  That submission was consistent with the findings of the sentencing judge, which were not challenged.      
44Finally, the Crown submitted that the applicant had the benefit of the sentencing judge having ordered that all of the sentences be served concurrently, in circumstances where some partial accumulation would have been appropriate.  It was submitted that the imposition of totally concurrent sentences reflected an approach which was generous to the applicant.
Consideration and conclusion45In determining whether some lesser sentence is warranted, it is necessary to have regard to the entirety of the objective circumstances of the offending.  In the present case those objective circumstances commenced some time prior to the actual offending, at a time when the victim was walking to the home of a friend.  She was intercepted by the applicant who was unknown to her and who persisted in accompanying her on the pretence that he wished to do nothing more than ""walk her home"". He did so in circumstances where the victim gave him no indication that she required, much less wanted, him to accompany her.    
46Upon arrival at her friend's home, the victim twice refused the applicant's invitation to accompany him to a hotel, telling him that she simply wanted to go inside.  Far from respecting the victim's wishes, the applicant then forcibly dragged her to the rear area of a nearby residence where the offending took place in the area of a chicken coop.  The offending itself was obviously serious, and the description given to it by the sentencing judge was apt.    
47As I have previously noted, one of the primary submissions advanced by counsel for the applicant concerned the relative seriousness of those counts which involved digital penetration when compared with those other counts which involved other forms of forced sexual intercourse.  In light of that submission, it is necessary to make a number of observations.  
48This Court has previously said that in cases of this kind the type of forced intercourse is not determinative of the objective seriousness of the offence, and that the creation of some form of hierarchy in that regard is neither possible nor appropriate (see for example R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, per Simpson J at [24]).  
49In R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 McClellan CJ at CL said (at [35] - [36]):
""It is unnecessary to enter into a debate about the significance in sentencing of different types of penetration that fall within the concept of sexual intercourse:  see R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20.  The simple fact is that the respondent inserted his finger into the child's vagina for however brief a period of time so as to cause her a physical injury with pain at least of a transient nature.  He did so notwithstanding that the child awoke and told him to stop.
The respondent argues that it was open for his Honour to find that digital penetration was less serious than penile penetration and this was a very significant fact in the assessment of the degree of criminality.  But it has been made clear that it is not a case of simply considering the nature of the penetration in isolation as being ranked in some form of hierarchy:  R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575.  What is to be considered is the type of penetration in all the circumstances surrounding the offending.  The type of penetration is simply one factor and by itself does not indicate how serious the particular offence is.  The simple fact is that had the intercourse in this case been penile penetration it would have been an offence of very great seriousness if for no other reason than because of the age of the child.  In such a case the seriousness of the offence may have been above mid range.  But the fact that it was not penile penetration does not mean that the offence is reduced to low range"".
50To the extent that this Court has said that an act of digital penetration is less serious than an act of penile penetration, it has been consistently stressed that such a proposition is a general one, and that the entirety of the circumstances of particular offending must be taken into account.  For example, in R v O [2005] NSWCCA 327 (which was a decision expressly referred to by the sentencing judge in the present case) Sully J (with whom Hidden and Hall JJ agreed) said (at [32]-[33]):
""I would accept that as a general proposition an act of digital penetration, as such, is less serious than an act of penile penetration as such.  I do not agree, however, that such a general proposition is more or less as of course a proposition of universal applicability in cases of digital penetration.  One has only to read the victim impact statements of KW and of JS to see at once how damaging to a particular victim an act of digital penetration, let alone more than a single such act, can be to a very young child. I would at once agree that the acts of digital penetration are not properly to be regarded as the worst types of sexual intercourse on a scale of statutory penalties that peaks at a sentence of imprisonment for 20 years.  That said, however, I do not agree that the offences here relevant are to be treated as though they were more or less trifling offences.  They were, in my opinion, nothing of the kind. They were, for the reasons earlier herein explained, in my opinion offences of significant objective criminality"".
51In R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20; (2009) 194 A Crim R 1 (to which McClellan CJ at CL referred to in King (supra)) Tobias JA (at [21]) expressed the view that this Court should give consideration to departing from the general proposition that digital sexual intercourse was to be regarded as generally less serious than penile sexual intercourse.  James J (at [27]) reserved his position on the issue raised by Tobias JA.  However, Price J said (at [56]): 
""Relevant considerations in determining where on the scale of seriousness an offence contrary to s. 61I of the Crimes Act lies include ""the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation ... see R v Gebrail (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 November 1994, unreported) per Mahoney JA at 10-11.  To those matters I would add the duration of the offence.  Non-consensual sexual intercourse by digital penetration has generally been considered to be less serious than an offence of penile penetration:  see, for example, R v Santos Da Silva (Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 November 1995, unreported) per Grove J at 3, but each case will depend on its own facts.  There is no canon of law which mandates a finding that digital penetration must be considered less serious than other non-consensual acts of sexual intercourse.  Whilst the form of the forced sexual intercourse is an important factor it is not to be regarded as the sole consideration"".  
52In MH (the decision cited by counsel for the applicant) R S Hulme J (in reference to the observations of Tobias JA in Hibberd) said (at [37] - [38]):
""The matter was not argued.  Nor was the Court provided with anything like a comprehensive review of prior authorities, and there are a number.  Accordingly, this is not the occasion to attempt a detailed review of the topic.  However, as a judgment on a matter of fact, my view is that digital sexual intercourse is generally less serious than penile, particularly penile vaginal, intercourse.  Inherently, penile vaginal intercourse carries risks or greater risks of venereal disease and pregnancy compared with digital vaginal intercourse.  To my mind, and I venture to say in the view of most of the community, penile vaginal intercourse is also a greater affront both physically and mentally to an unwilling victim in consequence of the greater subjugation of her body and intrusion of privacy that such intercourse generally involves.
Other forms of forced penile intercourse have their own attributes and incidents, often closely associated with other circumstances of the assault and the relativity might not be so clear.  Nevertheless, in these cases also I would generally regard penile intercourse as more serious than digital"".
53Importantly, his Honour went on to say (at [39]):
""In saying what I have in the two immediately preceding paragraphs, I do not, of course, purport to lay down any proposition of law.  Nor do I mean to suggest that all cases of penile intercourse are worse than all cases of digital intercourse.  Merely do I wish to ensure that Tobias JA's remarks do not pass without dissent and to indicate my views on a topic that does arise in this case ..."" 
54To the extent that the submissions of counsel for the applicant suggested otherwise, it should be emphasised that there is no decision of this Court which supports the proposition that digital sexual intercourse is, of itself, less serious than some other form of forced sexual intercourse.  Reference to the above authorities demonstrates that it has been emphasised, on more than one occasion, that the objective seriousness of offending is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question. Concentrating upon, or giving primary significance to, the form of the forced sexual intercourse in determining its objective seriousness reflects an erroneous approach.  It is equally erroneous to attempt to rank forms of forced sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness.  
55The circumstances of the present case serve as a good example of both the rationale behind, and the correctness of, the approach consistently stated by this Court.  The applicant's offending involved two separate instances of digital penetration of the victim.  Both of those instances, on the victim's evidence, involved the insertion of more than one finger into the victim's vagina.  In respect of the first, the victim gave evidence that the applicant had ""shoved his hand up my vagina and moved his hand around roughly"".  There was evidence that the victim suffered significant injuries, including grazing of the vaginal wall and significant swelling to the left labia minora.  
56In these circumstances, to concentrate upon the fact that the offending involved digital penetration as opposed to some other form of forced sexual intercourse would be to ignore the rough manner in which it was carried out, and the injuries which resulted from it, both matters being directly relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.  It is evident that those matters led the sentencing judge to conclude (at ROS 17) that the applicant's acts of digital penetration were not to be viewed as less serious than the penile penetration.  That was a conclusion which was clearly supported by the evidence.  It was also one which reflected an approach which was entirely consistent with the authorities to which I have referred.
57His Honour (commencing at ROS 18) undertook an assessment of the applicant's subjective case.  It is clear that he took into account the applicant's traumatic upbringing in Liberia, which included his mother, two brothers and a sister all being killed in a political uprising when the applicant was in his twenties.  His Honour also had regard (commencing at ROS 19) to the contents of a report of Dr Allnutt, psychiatrist, who diagnosed the applicant as suffering from an anxiety disorder with depressive symptoms.  In addition, his Honour made specific reference (commencing at ROS 21) to evidence given by a volunteer who had assisted the applicant and his family to settle into the local community, and who told the court (inter alia) that the applicant's wife suffered from psychiatric ill health resulting in the applicant's children being placed in the care of the Department of Community Services.  
58The sentencing judge balanced those various matters against the objective seriousness of the offending and concluded (at ROS 26) that they did not justify a reduction in sentence.  In my view, that conclusion was well open to him.  The applicant's offending was serious and degrading, and justified the imposition of the sentences which his Honour imposed.  Indeed in my view, some partial accumulation of the sentences would have been justified so as to properly reflect the applicant's overall culpability.  The applicant has derived a not insignificant benefit from the fact that all sentences were ordered to be served concurrently.  
59Finally, the statistical and comparative material upon which the applicant relied does not persuade me that some lesser sentence is warranted.  There have been numerous statements, both by the High Court and by this Court, concerning the limited use to which statistical material can be put (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]; Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 at [2] (per Campbell JA) and at [34] per Rothman J).  Whilst I have had regard to those authorities to which the Court was referred, the process of comparing one sentence with another is inherently problematic (see Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 at [45] - [46] per Adamson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed).  
60In my view, none of the matters advanced on behalf of the applicant support a conclusion that there has been substantial injustice arising out of the sentence imposed, or that some other sentence is warranted in law.  This is particularly so in circumstances where, in the course of the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the applicant expressly conceded that the overall sentence imposed was one which was within the range of proper sentencing discretion.  
ORDER61For the reasons I have expressed I propose the following order:
(i)The application for extension of time is dismissed.

2762708,R v Tuivaga [2013] NSWSC 1626,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: On 26 June 2013, Kirk Tuivaga (the offender) pleaded not guilty to the charge that he on 12 October 2010 did murder Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez. The offender entered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Ruiz-Sanchez. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.

2The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value the community places upon the preservation of human life is reflected by the need to have the conduct denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case: R v Macdonald (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise, as in all offences of manslaughter, is that the life of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported). 

3During the proceedings on sentence, Mr P Leask appeared for the Crown and Mr G Brady for the offender. 

4Samuel Lockett and Carl Brown have been found guilty by separate juries of the murder of the deceased. Bradley Owen Trawin-Hadfield and Richard Barnes pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased which was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment charging them with murder. With no disrespect to these offenders, I will refer to them furthermore by their surnames during these sentencing remarks. 

5It has been necessary to deliver separate sentencing remarks for each offender because of the individual jury trials for Lockett and Brown and the differences in the agreed facts upon sentence for the other offenders. However, the parity principle is of importance when sentencing each of them and is not confined to sentences imposed upon co-offenders who have committed the same crime. It can also be applied to sentences imposed upon persons who are co-offenders by virtue of having been engaged in the same criminal enterprise, regardless of the charges that have actually been laid against them: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462; (2011) 86 ALJR 36 at [30]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [136]. However, the significant practical difficulties with this approach are well recognised: Jimmy at [203]; Green at [30]. 

6In my view, there is little utility in considering parity with Lockett and Brown who have been found guilty of murder. The roles that they played in the death of the deceased were much greater than the offenders who have pleaded guilty to manslaughter and there is a deal of difference between the maximum penalties for murder and for manslaughter. The question of parity is considered at [25] below. I have firmly borne in mind the principle of proportionality when sentencing all of the offenders: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15]. 

7The pleas to manslaughter were entered by the offender and Barnes on the same day. A document was tendered by the Crown without objection which set out the basis of criminal liability for the offender and Barnes (ex A TB 1):

Manslaughter as to Tuivaga and Barnes

""1. There was in existence a joint criminal enterprise to assault Mr Ruiz-Sanchez,

2. The offenders were party to the agreement, and 

3. The accused (sic) participated in the joint criminal enterprise in that they physically assaulted Mr Ruiz-Sanchez, encouraged other parties to the joint enterprise to do so, and remained present throughout, being ready and willing to assist others if need be, and 

4. at a point in time before Samuel Lockett struck Mr Ruiz-Sanchez on the head with the gun, killing him, the offenders, knowing that other parties to the agreement intended assaulting Mr Ruiz-Sanchez, realised that Mr Ruiz-Sanchez was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 

5. The assault upon Mr Ruiz-Sanchez was unlawful and dangerous. 

6. The offenders did not foresee either death or grievous bodily harm as a possible consequence. 

7. The offenders did not foresee that another party to the agreement would employ the violence applied by Samuel Lockett, or it being achieved by use of a weapon.""

8Accordingly, the offender must be sentenced on the basis that he did not foresee the violence applied by Lockett or that death or grievous bodily harm was a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased. 

9A statement of agreed facts was tendered by consent (ex A TB 1). The agreed facts are: 
""On 12 October 2010, the offender Tuivaga was present at his home at xxxxxxxx Smithfield. He had been working that day and had arrived home from work at about 6pm. At the house were his defacto brother-in-law Carl Brown, Brad Trawin-Hadfield, Samuel Lockett and Richard Barnes. Also at home was the offender's defacto wife, Donna Paraone, and their children.
All 5 offenders left the home in a red BMW motor vehicle belonging to the offender's defacto. The group went to xxxxxxxxxxx Mt Pritchard to the offender's defacto sister-in-law's (Jasmine Psaroudis) house.
After arriving at Ms Psaroudis' house, the offender became aware that Brown intended to confront the deceased, who lived next door xxxxxxxx. The offender was aware that Brown intended to confront the deceased over money and text messages sent to Brown by the deceased.
The five offenders left the house together. The offender was aware that a physical confrontation with the deceased was a real possibility.
The offender became involved in the physical confrontation. While involved he was grabbed by the deceased and he pushed the deceased. The offender had his head down in the fight when he heard a loud bang.
All the offenders then ran to the BMW motor vehicle. At the motor vehicle one of the offenders shouted at Lockett saying ""Why the fuck did you do that?"" One of the offenders then shouted ""He shot him."" The offender noticed that he had been shot.
The offender was arrested at about 8.10pm at Cumberland Highway, Smithfield. He was in the same BMW vehicle. Brown was also in the vehicle. The other 3 offenders were not present. The offender was taken to hospital where he was treated for gunshot wounds.
The offender agrees that he was party to a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and that he participated by becoming involved in the fight.
The offender did not foresee either death or grievous bodily harm as a possible consequence or that another party to the agreement would employ the violence applied by Lockett, or it being achieved by use of a weapon.""

10I make findings of fact in accordance with the agreed facts for the purpose of sentencing the offender. 

11The offender agreed with the four others to assault the deceased, with whom the offender had no disagreement. When he left Ms Psaurodis' house, he was aware that a physical confrontation with the deceased was a real possibility. Although he did not know that a firearm was in the possession of his co-offenders, he realised that the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. He joined in the cowardly attack upon the deceased who was outnumbered. He pushed the deceased and continued his involvement in the fight until the shotgun discharged. His close proximity to the deceased at that time is evidenced by the pellet wounds that he suffered. 

12Matters that mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence are that the agreement to assault the deceased was not entered into until shortly before he was attacked. Furthermore, he did not foresee that any one of his co-offenders would employ the degree of violence used by Lockett, or that the degree of violence would be achieved by the use of any type of weapon, or that death or grievous bodily harm was a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise. 

13The offender was born on 22 August 1981. He was 29 years old at the time of the offence and is now 32 years old. His prior criminal history reveals a conviction at the Parramatta District Court on 27 May 2011 for one count of reckless wounding whilst in company on 4 October 2009. The agreed facts for this offence disclose serious violence by the offender. His record also reveals driving offences of a serious nature that were committed on 27 December 2011. The particular significance of these offences is that the offender was on bail for the deceased's murder when they were committed. 

14In view of the offender's prior offence of violence, I give more weight to personal deterrence and the protection of society than otherwise would have been the case: R v McNaughton. 

15At the time of the manslaughter, the offender was on bail for the offence of reckless wounding whilst in company. It is an aggravating factor that the offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

16On 25 June 2013, Mr Brady informed the court that he thought the matter was going to be resolved and the jury panel was not required. This was the day before the offender's trial for murder was fixed to commence. On 26 June 2013, the offender and Barnes pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. Mr Brady submitted that the plea should attract a utilitarian discount of 15 per cent whereas the Crown contended that such a discount should not be more than 11 per cent. Mr Brady argued that the plea was to manslaughter rather than murder with which the offender had been initially charged, the plea saved significant court time and the deceased's family and friends having to go through the process of giving evidence a third time. I should mention that a utilitarian discount does not reflect considerations arising from the plea, such as saving witnesses from giving evidence, but this is relevant to the offender's remorse: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. Although this was a late plea, the estimated length of the trial was two to three weeks and involved issues arising from the principles of joint criminal enterprise. I assess the utilitarian value of the plea to be 12.5 per cent. 

17The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. His background is principally drawn from the report of Tim Watson-Munro, a psychologist (ex 3). The offender was educated at Toongabbie East Primary School and Macquarie Boys Technical High School where he completed his HSC at the age of 17. He then became involved in labouring and factory work for several years xxxx xxxxx  xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxx in 2000 where he remained for about four years prior to his dismissal. He then returned to labouring work. 

18The offender has been in a de facto relationship for the past nine years and has three daughters aged seven, three and two. Mr Brady told me that the offender's fiancé is seriously ill suffering from cervical cancer and is presently undergoing chemotherapy which, if unsuccessful may mean a very short life expectancy. Mr Brady did not submit that these family circumstances were ""wholly"" exceptional so that the hardship to the offender's family by his incarceration was to be taken into account as a mitigating consideration. I do, however, take into account the offender's difficult personal circumstances. 

19Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 23A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. By his plea of guilty, the offender has accepted responsibility for the part that he played in the death of the deceased and his plea indicates contrition for his offending. Furthermore, the plea saved the Crown witnesses, particularly Ms Knaggs, from giving evidence in a third trial which I take into account as reflecting his remorse. Mr Watson-Munro reports that the offender expressed deep remorse for what occurred. I accept that the offender is remorseful. I take into account his remorse as a mitigating factor. 

20Mr Brady submitted that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation evidenced by his remorse, acceptance of culpability, employment history, removal from Carl Brown and general law-abiding behaviour. The difficulty with this submission is that it overlooks the offender's serious offending whilst subject to bail. The offender's disregard on two occasions for his conditional liberty detracts from an optimistic view being taken: see [13] and [15] above. I am unable to make a positive finding on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. His prospects of rehabilitation remain uncertain. 

21Mr Watson-Munro was asked to provide a report ""regarding the impact of [the offender's] incarceration against a backdrop of his prior employment xxxx xxxxx xxxxx"": ex 3 p 2. The psychologist reports that the offender has been a segregation prisoner for the entirety of his confinement xxxxx xxx xxxx xxxx. He records the offender's claim of being given a difficult time xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx. He recounts that the offender has been locked in his cell for some 23 hours a day. 

22The offender told the psychologist that he has no friends in gaol. Mr Watson-Munro expresses the opinion that this has aggravated the offender's underlying depressive illness and sense of despair. A formal diagnosis of a depressive illness has been made. The offender was placed on 30 milligrams of Avanza, but he told the psychologist that this has been of no real benefit to him. Mr Watson-Munro reports that ""as testing indicates, [the offender] is still suffering Severe Depression with a particular concern referable to active suicidal ideation"" (ex 3 p 4 par 2). Mr Watson-Munro writes that the offender anticipates that the balance of time that he is required to serve will be equally onerous in the context of both segregation and problems with xxxxx xxx xxxx. The psychologist opines that the offender requires treatment in addition to the psychotropic medication he is taking which should involve cognitive behaviour therapy. 

23The offender has been held in segregation and has been the subject of a non-association order. The danger to his personal safety that he faces whilst in custody xxx xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxx xxxxxx is reflected in the memorandum dated 25 June 2013 which refers to the offender being ""at risk from known members of the REBELS OMCJ"" and to ""several Association Alerts"" (ex 1). It appears that these restrictions have led to the offender being locked in his cell for 23 hours a day. As a result of the conditions of his incarceration, the offender has little contact with other inmates and is unable to access programs or courses. His ability to exercise and to make telephone calls is restricted. It is more likely than not that the offender will continue to serve his sentence under these conditions which are more difficult than the custodial conditions of the general prison population. It is well recognised that every year spent in protective custody is equivalent to a longer loss of liberty under the ordinary conditions of imprisonment: AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; (1999) 198 CLR 111 at [105]. 

24Mr Brady did not submit that the offender's mental condition was relevant to the commission of the offence but submitted that it made a custodial sentence more burdensome for the offender. He also contended that it may have some impact upon the court's consideration of general deterrence. It is unsurprising that the hard conditions in which the offender is serving his sentence have aggravated the offender's underlying depressive illness and sense of despair. Although the offender has been treated for his mental condition in custody and Avanza has been prescribed, the offender's segregation makes it more difficult for treatment to succeed. I accept that the offender's sentence will weigh more heavily upon him and the conditions of his custody exacerbate his depression. I take into account the hardship that the offender experiences in custody as a matter in mitigation: Clinton v R [2009] NSWCCA 276. I do not consider that it reduces the weight to be given to general deterrence as his mental condition had no causal relationship with the commission of the offence. 

25Both Mr Crown and Mr Brady submitted that when considering the parity principle, the culpability of the offender and Barnes was the same. Although the offender became physically involved in the attack upon the deceased and Barnes did not, the offender was not aware that a firearm was in the possession of his co-offenders, whereas Barnes with that knowledge did not desist from participating in the agreement to assault the deceased and remained ready and willing to assist. I assess them as being equally culpable for the offence. I turn to their subjective cases. The offender is about two years older than Barnes but Barnes' prior criminal offending is marginally more serious than the offender. Barnes, however, is not required to serve his sentence in protection nor does he have a mental condition. In my opinion, the hard custodial conditions under which the offender is to serve his sentence justify a lesser sentence than that to be imposed on Barnes. When sentencing Barnes, I discussed the question of the offender's parity with Barnes at [21] of the sentencing remarks: R v Barnes NSWSC [2013] 1627.

26Victim impact statements from Ms Knaggs, Maria Vinas, the deceased's mother, and Virginia Ruiz-Sanchez, his sister, were tendered to the court. The contents of these statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's partner and his family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

27Mr Brady drew my attention to sentences imposed in other cases. Whilst I found that material to be helpful, each case depends on its own circumstances. 

28During sentencing submissions, there was some discussion about the commencement date of the sentence. It was initially contended the offender's period of time in custody that was solely referable to the manslaughter was 129 days, but this submission overlooked the offender's sentence for reckless wounding of 2 years imprisonment that commenced on 15 October 2010 and expired on 14 October 2012 with a non-parole period of 12 months expiring on 14 October 2011. The offender was also sentenced on 1 March 2012 in the Parramatta Local Court for ""driving dangerously"" to imprisonment for 14 months 11 days commencing on 27 September 2012 and expiring on 7 December 2013 with a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 27 September 2012 and expiring on 26 June 2013. The earliest date that the offender was to be released on parole was 26 June 2013. The offender was arrested for the deceased's murder on 4 October 2010 and there are 11 days prior to the commencement of the sentence for reckless wounding that are solely referable to the manslaughter. 

29As the offender has served sentences for reckless wounding and driving offences since he went into custody, it is necessary to consider the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. The offences for which the offender was sentenced in the District Court and Local Court and the offence of manslaughter are discrete and independent acts of criminality. This does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. In the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to commence the sentence on 15 June 2013 being the date that the offender would have been released on parole less the 11 days in custody that are solely referable to the present offence. 

30I find special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term of the sentence being his need for appropriate psychological treatment upon release. I have determined that a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality for the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].

31Taking into account all matters that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence is 7 years 6 months. The overall sentence is reduced by 12.5 per cent to 6 years 6 months and 23 days. 

32Kirk Tuivaga for the offence of manslaughter, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 6 years 6 months and 23 days consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 15 June 2013 and expiring on 14 December 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years 23 days commencing on 15 December 2017 and expiring on 6 January 2020. 

33The earliest date that you will be eligible to be released on parole is 14 December 2017. 

34I ask Mr Brady to advise the offender of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and of its application to the offence for which he has been sentenced.

2762714,R v RMC [2013] NSWCCA 285,"Judgment

1LATHAM J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: This is an appeal pursuant to s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) against the acquittal of the respondent by a jury at the direction of a judge of the District Court. 

3On 13 May 2013, the respondent was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to a single count of dangerous driving causing death. A jury was empanelled and a trial proceeded. But on the third day, while the Crown was still presenting its case, his Honour Judge Maiden SC declared, ""it ends now"". After giving a short judgment he directed the jury to deliver a verdict of not guilty. 

4Serious errors attended his Honour's decision to direct the respondent's acquittal. The acquittal must be quashed and the respondent returned to the District Court for further trial.

The Crown case

5At about 8.30pm on 19 August 2011, the respondent was driving a car on Limeburners Creek Road approaching Clarence Town (which is a little inland from the highway between Raymond Terrace and Karuah). Ms Danielle Thomlinson, his girlfriend, was sitting in the front passenger's seat. 

6Just before leaving generally rural terrain and entering Clarence Town, the road bends to the left and then immediately crosses the Williams River Bridge. There is no street lighting in the area. The speed limit is 50 km/h. The Crown case was that the respondent lost control of the car when he came to the bend in the road and in the course of trying to regain control he collided with the bridge. The car went through a wooden railing and ended up in the river. Sadly, Ms Thomlinson died as a result.

7In a subsequent police interview the respondent gave an account that was to the following effect. He was unfamiliar with the road. The road surface was wet from earlier rain. There was thick fog. The car's headlights were on high beam and the light was reflecting back off the fog. He could only see about two car-lengths in front. He was travelling at 60 km/h but slowed down due to the fog to 50-55 km/h. He did not see the bend in the road until he arrived at it. The car was beginning to cross to the wrong side of the road and he panicked. He pulled the steering wheel in the direction of the bend but lost control. The car slid back and forth across the road. It hit one side of the bridge and then went through the railing on the other side and plunged into the river.

8The interviewing officer, Sergeant Peter Stace, asked the respondent how he thought the collision occurred. He replied, ""I think just lack of vision. Like I said earlier on in the interview, lack of vision and the fog. Panicking."" He was asked a similar question a short time later and he replied, ""The fog and the conditions of the road"".

The course of the trial

9The Crown Prosecutor told the jury in his opening address, ""if the fog was as thick as he says, that he could not see more than two car lengths in front of his vehicle, he was going much too fast for the conditions"". The prosecutor told the jury that there was no sign warning a driver of the bend in the road and not much warning of the bridge aside from one that indicated a load limit of 40 tonne and a width of 3 metres. Nevertheless, it was the Crown case that ""the accused was driving too fast for the prevailing conditions and that the accused was sufficiently inadvertent, that is, not looking properly for his driving to be in a real sense dangerous"".

10There were agreed facts that the respondent was the driver when the car was involved in an impact whereby the death of Ms Thomlinson was occasioned. It was also agreed that neither alcohol nor drugs were a factor in the respondent's driving. Accordingly, the sole issue for the jury to determine was whether the respondent's driving was objectively dangerous.

11The Crown called a number of witnesses on the first day of the trial and the following morning. Most of them were civilians and police officers who responded to the incident. None of them were in a position to give any direct evidence as to the manner of the respondent's driving, although one of them, Mr Kevin Smith, said that the respondent told him that it was foggy and that he did not see the bridge for that reason. 

12The Crown called Sergeant Stace just after midday on the second day. He was attached to, indeed in charge of, the Newcastle Crash Investigation Unit. He had been a police officer for some 27 years and involved in crash investigation for about 10 years. There was no dispute about his expertise.

13Sergeant Stace was called out on the night of the incident and arrived at the scene at about 10.40pm. He provided the jury with a description of the roadway in the vicinity of the incident and of the bridge. Photographs were used as an aid to his descriptions. 

14His Honour began to question the officer when he was in the middle of explaining the nature and location of various signs that were visible for a driver proceeding in the respondent's direction of travel. The questioning occupies some three pages of transcript. His Honour asked about signs that were not present: signs that would indicate a bend in the road ahead; the presence of a single lane bridge; and that there should be no passing or overtaking on the bridge. He asked about why the absence of such signs was not mentioned in the officer's ""report"" (a reference to his first statement). 

15The judge sent the jury out for the luncheon adjournment a short time later. He then began to express his concerns to the Crown Prosecutor about the signage issue and whether the officer had been derelict in his compliance with the expert witness code of conduct by not including certain matters in his ""report"". He was critical of the officer for not including ""all material facts relevant to the investigation and to any opinion drawn"". 

16The Crown Prosecutor pointed out that the signage that was present or absent was clearly depicted in the photographs the officer had taken and which had been incorporated within his statement. He reminded the judge that the nature of the signage, present and absent, had been referred to in his opening address to the jury. 

17The judge then suggested that the signage issue was relevant to the decision to prosecute the respondent in the first place. He expected that Sergeant Stace would have included ""comment about the signage or lack of signage there and not just to put matters material to the prosecution case and leave out matters that may not support that case"". 

18The judge required the Crown Prosecutor to obtain instructions as to whether Sergeant Stace was still to be relied upon as an expert witness where, ""on the face of it"" he had not complied with the expert witness code of conduct.

19Upon resumption, and still in the absence of the jury, the Crown Prosecutor sought to call some evidence on the voir dire. He did not indicate the nature of that evidence but it would obviously have been his intention to call Sergeant Stace and invite him to explain the matters that were concerning his Honour. But the judge then changed tack and asked the Crown Prosecutor ""what are the particulars of the manner of driving here?""

20After some further exchange, the judge indicated that ""in respect of the signage I would have thought that's entirely relevant to the question of whether or not he, the accused, noticed or didn't notice the corner"". The Crown Prosecutor inquired whether his Honour was returning to ""the issue about the expert"". The judge said that he would not call him ""the expert""; he would call him ""the sergeant"". The Crown Prosecutor said he wished to be heard about this but was cut off. 

21The judge then moved to expressing concern about what Sergeant Stace had put to the respondent in the interview and to the admissibility of the interview. I interpolate that the judge had not read (and never did read) the transcript of the interview. Moreover, there had been no suggestion of any objection to the interview going into evidence; the Crown case had not yet progressed to that point.

22The discussion then returned to the subject of the signage, present and absent. The judge referred to certain provisions of the Road Rules 2008 (NSW) and to literature, text books and Australian Standards concerning signs. He inquired ""why isn't the Road Authority brought into this case?"" 

23The discussion came to an end with the judge adjourning the matter to the following day. He expected that the Crown would provide to the defence by 8am ""full particulars of those matters relevant to the signage on this road, and also an investigation at least into the appropriateness of the signage. That is, each sign should be checked as to whether it is appropriate, whether it complies with the Road Rules 2008, and/or with the Australian Standard for such signage. And that's a minimum."" His Honour also asked for the Newcastle City Local Area Police Commander to be present the next day. 

24Day 3 of the trial commenced with the Crown Prosecutor not conceding the judge's concern about Sergeant Stace's compliance with the expert witness code of conduct but indicating that he would not lead expert evidence from him in any event. The judge's response was to the effect that it was too late; he had already given expert evidence; he had not complied with the code of conduct; his evidence was therefore inadmissible. 

25Discussion moved to what the Crown case was. His Honour referred to the estimate of speed he had been told the respondent had provided in the police interview and asked what speed the Crown contended he should have been doing. The Crown Prosecutor then advised that Sergeant Stace had calculated the ""critical speed for the corner"" as 67 km/h; thus indicating that he should not have lost control if he proceeded around the corner at his estimated speed of 50-55 km/h.

26The judge then said he had a concern about the officer's competence. In this context his Honour indicated his understanding (more a misunderstanding) of the Crown case was that the respondent had safely negotiated the corner but had lost control when, without warning, he was confronted by a bridge that suddenly narrowed to a single lane. The Crown Prosecutor explained once again the way he was putting the case: in short, travelling too fast when vision was limited; seeing the corner too late to safely negotiate it; losing control; and colliding with the bridge.

27Senior counsel for the respondent, Mr Harben SC, then entered the discussion with reference to some of the evidence and the history of the matter. Then the Crown Prosecutor made a concession that an additional basis for the Crown case he had earlier relied upon (inadvertence) would be abandoned and the case would be confined to the ""too fast for the conditions"" basis. He indicated that the Crown would be relying upon what the respondent had said in the police interview.

28There was then this exchange:

CROWN PROSECUTOR: ... Could I make it perfectly clear that the Crown's complaining in this case that it is a matter, it's driving dangerously to proceed on a road when you can't see what's in front of you caused either by smoke or fog. That's the Crown case.

HIS HONOUR: Well, if that's the Crown case, it ends now.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: May it please your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Because you, the Crown is required to particularise that driving with, causally with the accident, and that's what you haven't done.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well the Crown says if you drive at twice the speed that you can see, when you get to a corner it's inevitable that you will crash and that's what happened here. That's the Crown case.

HIS HONOUR: Well where's the evidence of that?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I just handed it up to your Honour. [Undoubtedly a reference to a transcript of the police interview].

HIS HONOUR: That is, matters said by the accused four months after the event--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: --in circumstances where he's in shock at the time--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour. It's four months after the event when he's there with his mother--

HIS HONOUR: No, when he's in shock at the time of the accident site and--

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour--

HIS HONOUR: --taken away, on a road that he's never been.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And that's your case against him?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: That's the case that I'm directed to proceed with--

HIS HONOUR: Inconsistent with the measurements taken by the officer. Any application?

HARBEN: Yes, we make an application that the Crown case be dismissed on the basis that there is just no evidence of danger in accordance with the indictment, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you.

FOR JUDGMENT SEE SEPARATE TRANSCRIPT

The judge's ex tempore judgment

29As the above transcript extract reveals, the judge delivered judgment immediately without hearing anything from the Crown Prosecutor. The judgment traversed the following matters (but I will exclude reference to a number of matters that were entirely irrelevant):

What is clear to the court is this, that on this night a P-plate driver drove along a road where there was fog from time to time and, as he approached a corner which, in the court's mind, should have been signposted with at least a sign saying or indicating a sharp turn to the left and a sign indicating that the two lanes on the roadway converged into one, that that warning should have been given. There was an earlier warning, perhaps for local truck drivers, which indicated three metres, but it does not appear to be a sign, that one would see in a traffic handbook given to drivers from the RMS.

30His Honour then referred to the ""report"" by Sergeant Stace and its reference to compliance with the expert witness code of conduct. He asserted there were a number of ""failures"" on the officer's part: a failure to take photographs of the scene on the night; and making no comment about the adequacy of the signage. A third ""failure"" was to not make reference in ""the report"" to the following:

[T]his particular corner is without a left-hand turn sign, and one would have thought that where traffic is not warned that two lanes become one lane in a relatively short space and on a corner not lit, not signposted, and in circumstances on this country road where a person who is unfamiliar with the road, their headlights would not be focused to the left that is where the bridge was. This was a dangerous corner and situation for any driver, let alone one who had not travelled along it and perhaps one who was not experienced.

31His Honour referred to a second ""report"" by the officer in which he included his critical speed estimate for the corner of 67 km/h.

32His Honour then indicated his theory of what happened, reiterating his earlier mentioned misunderstanding of the Crown case:

The unfortunate accident occurred as, presumably, as the lights of the vehicle came upon the narrow part of the bridge and, arguably, at that point of time, the road narrowing, it required the person to react quickly. That unfortunately ended in the [back] left-hand part of the vehicle hitting what was the wooden railing and the vehicle then proceeding across to the opposite side of the roadway through the old wooden railing, the vehicle ultimately ending up in the river and the death of the passenger.

33His Honour indicated that if there had been a guard rail on the side of the approach to the bridge there likely would not have been injury to anyone. Having regard to what he considered to be the danger that this bridge provided, his Honour opined:

[I]t could and should have been anticipated by the authority [presumably a reference to the Roads and Maritime Service] and by Sergeant Stace to consider the question of the illumination of the accused's vehicle's headlights with what confronted him.

34After reference to an irrelevant consideration, his Honour turned to the respondent's police interview (which was the basis of the Crown case):

The Crown relied upon what was seen to be admissions made by the accused in an interview with Sergeant Stace four months after the accident. I am unaware as to why, in the circumstances of this matter, the accused was interviewed four months after the event. Obviously questions of memory, reconstruction and other matters come into play when looking at this sort of interview, but I do not understand any direct question in respect of the manner of driving on the corner or in relation to the bridge being asked in the record of interview. Clearly, if I am wrong on that I stand corrected, I have just been given the record of interview, which I have not read, however, what I do say is that this matter should not have proceeded from the outset on the particulars provided or as I understand them given by the Crown. This accident occurred either in or at the end of the corner, and, for those reasons, I propose to indicate to the jury direct a verdict [sic].

35Having announced his ruling and the reasons for it there was no need to say more. But the judge did say more by continuing to make criticisms of Sergeant Stace. He referred to having been told that the officer had calculated a coefficient of friction in order to calculate the critical speed of the corner. He said:

There are many cases, and there is a great amount of literature, to do with coefficients of friction and usually, in respect of expertise, the standard requires the person, if they have not tested the surface themselves to gain that coefficient, for that to be expressed expressly in the report with qualification. I do not understand such qualification being made. Again it is another serious matter that led to the events of the officer initially charging this matter. These are matters that should, in respect, that should be known to crash investigators and ordinarily are and can be checked in the literature available to all, let alone to crash investigators.

I see that the sergeant is also a mentor to other crash investigators. I draw that to his superiors' attention.

36In relation to this final disparagement of Sergeant Stace's competence, I note that he referred in both his first statement (which the judge had) (at [108]-[110]) and his second statement (which the judge did not have) (at [13]) to the precise manner in which he derived the coefficient of friction of a ""travelled wet bitumen surface"".

37Another matter to note about that last criticism of Sergeant Stace is that the judge had been told that the calculation of the critical speed of the corner was carried out at the request of the respondent's counsel prior to the trial; that is, it had no relevance to the respondent being charged.

The appeal

38It has been mentioned that this appeal was brought pursuant to s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. It provides that the Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to this Court against an acquittal by a jury at the direction of the trial judge (or an acquittal in a judge-alone trial, or in a summary trial in the Supreme or Land and Environment Courts). The appeal must be ""on any ground that involves a question of law alone"": s 107(2).

39A question was raised at the hearing as to the identification of the ""question of law alone"". With leave, the Crown filed after the hearing an amended notice of appeal with the ground identified as follows:

In determining whether there was a case to answer, his Honour erred by failing to deploy the correct legal test in:
(i) Making the determination to direct an acquittal prior to the completion of the Crown case
(ii) Failing to take the evidence in the Crown case at its highest
(iii) Making a determination that the evidence was incapable of supporting a verdict of guilty

40With his customary frankness and candour, Mr Gartelmann, counsel for the respondent, accepted that an assertion that the trial judge had failed to apply correct principles in directing a verdict of acquittal constituted a question of law alone. That concession should be accepted. It was also conceded, as it had to be, that the trial judge had erred in this respect.

41A convenient and concise summary of the principles that apply to the determination of a question as to whether there is a case to answer (or that there is no prima facie case) was provided in Mr Gartelmann's written submissions:

(a) A judge may direct a verdict of acquittal only if there is a defect in the evidence in the Crown case such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty; if there is evidence, though tenuous or inherently weak or vague, that is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, it must be left to the jury: Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207.

(b) In a case based on circumstantial evidence, a judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.

(c) There is no power to direct an acquittal on the basis that any resultant conviction would be unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74; Doney v The Queen.

Errors by the trial judge

42The judge made no reference to any of these well known and long-established principles. And he certainly did not apply them. For that reason, the appeal should be allowed unless there are discretionary factors militating against that course. 

43Whilst the Court's jurisdiction to intervene is constrained by the requirement for there to have been an error of law, not an error of fact, or mixed errors of law and fact, it is worth noting some of the factual errors as well. 

44The first misapplication of principles was to direct a verdict of guilty before the end of the Crown case. As counsel for the respondent observed, statements of principle regarding the power of a trial judge to determine whether there is a case to answer are universally expressed in terms that it arises only at the close of the Crown case: see, for example, May v O'Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658; R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 76-77. It is impossible to take the Crown case at its highest when the case is still being presented and the trial judge is not properly acquainted with the detail of the evidence yet to come. 

45Even with the partially presented prosecution case, the judge did not assess it in its most favourable light for the Crown. Indeed, he continually failed to come to grips with what the case was, despite repeated explanations by the Crown Prosecutor. 

46The Crown relied heavily upon the respondent's interview with the police. The judge had been provided with a transcript but he did not pause to read it. Moreover, what he had been told were some of the admissions made by the respondent he sought to downplay in their significance by reference to the four month delay until the interview took place. His Honour's reference to ""questions of memory, reconstruction and other matters come into play when looking at this sort of interview"" is the antithesis of taking the Crown case at its highest; and the observations were not based upon evidence in any event.

47The judge appears to have assessed the case in a light most favourable to the respondent. In fact, he developed his own theory of the case that virtually exonerated the respondent; a theory that was hypothetical and not based upon the evidence (presented and yet to be presented).

48The judge appears to have become distracted by the signage issue and this fed into his unwarranted and unfair criticism of Sergeant Stace. It was unwarranted and unfair because (a) his Honour had not read all of the statements made by the officer; (b) his Honour misunderstood parts of what he had read; and (c) there was a denial of fairness in not giving the officer an opportunity to explain. The proposal of the Crown Prosecutor to call evidence on the voir dire for that purpose was seemingly ignored.

Discretion

49Notwithstanding that the Crown has made good its contention that there was an error of law alone there remains a question as to whether the Court should intervene. Section 107 includes: 

(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal may affirm or quash the acquittal appealed against.

(6) If the acquittal is quashed, the Court of Criminal Appeal may order a new trial in such manner as the Court thinks fit. ...

50In R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; (2009) 199 A Crim R 199, Spigelman CJ discussed the discretion thereby reposed in the Court. He concluded (at [90]) that the Court should not order a new trial if satisfied that a conviction would be overturned as unreasonable, or on any other basis which would not warrant a retrial being ordered on a successful conviction appeal.

51In the present case, Mr Gartelmann focused his submissions on this question. It was his contention that ""the whole of the evidence available to the prosecution cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person immediately before he lost control"". In support of this contention he identified the following matters:

The speed at which the respondent was driving was not inherently dangerous and he said he had reduced his speed because of the conditions.

The respondent's estimate of how far he could see ahead (two car lengths) could not be reliable. It was provided four months after the event and his response was preceded with some uncertainty. 

The fact that the respondent did not see the upcoming left-hand curve earlier did not of itself demonstrate that his driving was dangerous.

There was no viable circumstantial case arising from the objective circumstances of the incident independent of the respondent's account to the police. 

52It was submitted that the central issue in the case did not depend upon the credibility of witnesses. Accordingly, it was submitted that the Court could, and should, conclude that the evidence at any new trial would leave a reasonable doubt as to the respondent's guilt.

Determination

53I am satisfied that the evidence available to the prosecution, together with the inferences that could be drawn, amount to a viable case. 

54I accept that the speed at which the respondent was driving would not in normal conditions be regarded as dangerous but there is a very real question of it being so in circumstances where, on any view, his forward vision was substantially impaired. 

55No doubt some advantage will be sought before the jury about the absence of a sign warning of a forthcoming bend in the road. But against that, the respondent's unfamiliarity with the road and his restricted forward vision might well be regarded as making all the more important that he slowed the car sufficiently to enable a safe response to anything unexpected.

56There was an issue between the parties in their submissions about the availability to the Crown of a circumstantial case independent of the respondent's account in his police interview. That is not an issue that needs to be determined; my conclusion concerning the viability of the prosecution case does not depend upon it. 

57The Crown read two affidavits by Sergeant Stace that were accompanied by extensive annexures. It is unnecessary to explore the detail; I simply note that there is some material within those annexures that might serve to allay the types of concerns about the signage issue that seemed to weigh so heavily with Maiden DCJ. 

58A final matter is that there was discussion at the hearing of the appeal about the appropriateness of Maiden DCJ presiding at any retrial. The Crown sought an order that the matter be remitted to another judge. Mr Gartelmann did not oppose that course. I have earlier referred to some very strong views expressed by his Honour, including criticism of the police officer in charge of the case that I have characterised as unwarranted and unfair. In my view, for the sake of the appearance of justice being done, this Court should accede to the Crown's request.

Orders

59I propose the following orders:

1. Quash the acquittal of the respondent.

2. Order that the respondent be retried in the District Court before a different judge.

60BARR AJ: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2762717,R v Steven John Smith [2013] NSWSC 1723,"Judgment
1The offender Steven John Smith has pleaded guilty of three offences, namely that: 
On 26 November 2010 at Kempsey he murdered Stanley Bruce Davies;
On or about 18 November 2010 at Dondingalong while in the company of two others and armed with offensive weapons he robbed John and Miriam Cowles of car keys and credit cards; and
At the same time and place while in the same company and similarly armed he robbed Miriam Cowles of a sum of money.  
THE FACTS
2An agreed statement of facts was received into evidence.  The following account is adapted from the statement.  At 11.30pm on 18 November 2010 the offender, his cousin Richard Keith Smith and a colleague broke and entered a house in a suburb of Kempsey.  The occupants, Mr and Mrs Cowles, were at home.  The three attackers took up a knife and an axe handle that they found in the house.  One of them laid into Mr Cowles with the axe handle.  They asked Mr and Mrs Cowles where their safe was and they said that they did not have a safe.  They stole car keys and bank cards.  The offender took Mrs Cowles in her car to an automatic teller machine and made her withdraw $800.  He stole the money from her.  On the way home he warned her that if she told the police they would come back for her.  He told her that he was sorry for robbing her and that he intended to use the money to buy drugs.  In the meantime the others bound Mr Cowles with rope.  The three drove off in Mrs Cowles' car taking with them the money and the other things they had stolen.
3Mr Cowles was 64 years old.  As a result of the beating he received he was badly bruised and shaken and put in fear.  Mrs Cowles, who was 66 years old, sustained no physical injuries but she, too, was put in fear.  Fortunately her car was recovered.  A victim impact statement signed by Mrs Cowles shows that after the attack she and Mr Cowles became nervous, fearful and vigilant.  Not surprisingly, their enjoyment of life was affected.
4Mr Stanley Bruce Davies lived alone at his house in Kempsey.  He was 75 years old.  He had safes and other secure storage containers in the house.  He kept a coin collection there.  At about midnight on the same night the offender, Richard Smith and a third man, Raymond Kennedy, broke into Mr Davies' house intending to steal.  Richard Smith cut himself on entry and bled there.  They attacked Mr Davies with fists and makeshift weapons they picked up inside the house.  They demanded that Mr Davies open his safe or tell them the combination.  He did neither.  The attackers moved to various parts of the house assaulting Mr Davies and forcing open or attempting to force open safes and other secure containers.
5They left Mr Davies helpless and grievously injured in the house.  He lay there unconscious until discovered on the following evening.  He was covered in blood and his head was severely swollen.  There were traces of his blood throughout the house.  Ambulance officers took him to hospital in Newcastle and attempts were made to resuscitate him.  Sadly, he failed to respond.  On 26 November 2010 staff turned off his life support equipment and he died.
6Doctor Cala examined the deceased's body post mortem on 30 November 2010.  He determined the cause of death as craniofacial trauma with bleeding of the face and the brain.  Each zygoma was fractured.  The hyoid bone was fractured.  There were lacerations behind the right ear.   The injuries to the face and head including the brain were consistent with a severe violent and sustained attack on the face, head and neck.  There was a compression injury to the neck.  The torso and upper limbs bore injuries consistent with assault.  On the back were patterned injuries that might have been inflicted with a tyre lever, a shaft or a golf club.  The upper arms were bruised.  The fingers were bruised and abraded.
7Relying on the results of DNA tests of blood found at the house, police suspected that Richard Smith was responsible.  They went to his house and arrested him.  Others were present, including the offender and Kennedy.
8In mid December 2010 the offender was heard to say that:  
We just wanted money,
The other boys hit him,  
Someone had jumped on his head.
9In the same conversation the offender said that he had tried to clear the man's airway because he was frothing at the mouth.
10Ms Anita Duffy, psychologist, interviewed the offender.  Her report came into evidence.  Some of what the offender told Ms Duffy about himself was uncontroversial. The offender was born in 1987.  He is now 26 years old.  His parents were both Aboriginal people from the Dunghutti group.  Both were heavy drinkers and early on the offender witnessed arguments they had when they were drinking.  Sometimes he witnessed violent acts.  He was removed into the custody of his grandmother when he was about three years old.  Also in his grandmother's household were members of the wider family, including an aunt and her son Richard Smith.  He was five years older than the offender.  From then on the offender and Richard Smith saw a lot of each other.  The offender was part of his grandmother's household until well into his teenage years.  He entered into a life of dependence on alcohol and other drugs with the commission of the offences that such a life demands.
11He left high school during Year 9.  He has had no trade training.  He has not worked.
12The offender began to drink heavily and to take cannabis in his mid-teens.  That led him inevitably into other trouble.  In 2002 he was dealt with in the Children's Court for breaking entering and stealing.  There was a control order and a bond.  That experience was repeated a number of times during 2003 and 2004.  In 2005 the offender was committed to custody for the first time in an adult prison.  There was a non-parole period of four months. There followed a short sentence with a non-parole period of one month.
13The offender graduated to other illegal drugs and his principal drug of choice became heroin.  All his offences were property offences of the kind normally associated with the abuse of alcohol and other drugs.  They were or were mostly committed in company.  
14They became more serious.  In 2007 the offender was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for three years and nine months for aggravated breaking entering and committing a serious indictable offence.  The non-parole period was two years.
15The present offences were committing during the ensuing period of parole.  In May 2012 the offender was sentenced in the District Court for aggravated breaking and entering in company to a sentence of about three years and four months.  The non-parole expired on 7 August 2013 but the head sentence is not due to expire until September next year.
16The summary of all this that during the period of about eight years beginning late in 2005 the offender has spent non-parole periods in custody totalling four years and eight months.  In addition he has been held in custody on remand, bail refused, for more than a year.  
17Ms Duffy tested the offender.  She noticed as she spoke to him that he found it very difficult to understand what she was saying.  She had to resort to very simple language.  The offender displayed a limited vocabulary.  His test results bore out Ms Duffy's impression.  His verbal intelligence was in the lowest percentile.  Ninety-nine percent of the population would perform better on the test than he.  Remarkably however on the non-verbal intelligence test the offender scored better than 79% of the population.  In Ms Duffy's view that meant that he could undertake technical courses to certificate and even diploma level.  She thought that he should be encouraged to undertake information technology and general education courses in technology.  She noted the offender's strong intent to do so and thought that would assist him in finding regular employment.
18The offender gave Ms Duffy a detailed account of his life in his grandmother's house.  He said something of the movement in and out of the household of his cousin Richard Smith.  He said that he recalled always looking up to his cousin and copying him like a role model.  Of course he and Richard Smith were separated from time to time for significant periods when either was or both were in custody.  The offender attributed a return to the use of heroin following a period of abstinence to the return of Richard Smith to the family after service of a sentence.  He told Ms Duffy, I think referring to his early life in the household, that he would follow Richard round and do whatever he asked him.  Even in adulthood he said he continued to have this subservient approach.  Even though Richard had hit him when young he always looked up to him and described him as a role model.
19Statements like these were relied on as mitigating the offender's criminality.  The submission was that he was a man of low intelligence led on by a strong-minded relative.  
20The only evidence to this effect came from Ms Duffy, who repeated what the offender had told her.  The offender did not give evidence.  
21The crown submitted that notwithstanding his low verbal standard of intelligence as revealed by the test results, the offender was able to make his own choices.
22The only other recorded utterance of the offender about Richard Smith was in an electronic record of a conversation he had with friends.  He said this. The record shows that three people were speaking, one with the initials DH, one with the initials CJ and the offender:
DH:  Mate I'm telling you. Cunts look at Poochie cause he's quiet like, he stands there quiet, does his own thing.
CJ:  That's the cunts you always - that's what my mum says.
DH:  Yeah I'm telling you.
CJ:  Watch the quiet cunts cause they're always fucking loopy in the head.  That's what they're standing there thinking, what they're doing, what they're going to do next.
DH:  See what he told me mate.  What he told me is full on.  He don't give a fuck man.  If he had a gun he'd dead set shoot you... fuckin.
CJ:  (Inaudible.)
This offender:  Yeah he's off his cunt that Pooch.  I'd hate to get on the wrong side of the cunt.
23I am prepared to accept that the offender knew Richard Smith well and even admired him, but I am not prepared to accept that Richard Smith led the offender into doing anything he was not ready to do.  By the time of these attacks the offender was using heroin again and needed money to buy his next dose.  
24Ms Duffy relayed the offender's account of the attack in these words:
In relation to the murder charge Mr Smith stated that he participated in it because his cousin Richard needed money for drugs.  Mr Smith was 'off my face' on heroin at the time and agreed with Richard's idea to break into the place.  Mr Smith said when they found that the man was at home he thought they would leave but unfortunately the other two co-offenders attacked the man demanding he open the safe.  Mr Smith kept watch ducking in and out of the house.  When he found the man unconscious and gasping for air he tried to clear his airways and resuscitate him.  He had no role in the assault and eventual death of the man but acknowledged that he did nothing to stop his co-offenders from hitting him.  He was alarmed by the extent of the man's injuries and wanted to call an ambulance but his cousin Richard threatened him saying ""the only person to get in the ambulance will be you"".
25On the other hand, things the offender said to colleagues on an earlier occasion are, I think, more likely to be true.  In a conversation recorded by listening device he said this. SS refers to the offender:
CJ:  So what happened, did youse end up getting anything that night?
SS:  Nothing bro.
CJ:  What, he didn't give up nothing?
SS:  No fucking.
DH:  400, hey you said, hey?
SS(as said):  Nothing.
SS(as said):  Oh that dead guy, yeah.
SS(as said):  Oh yeah - I - the dead guy.
CJ:  So that's it?  You're looking at a big whack for nothing, dead.  Don't look like fuck.  You too you little cunt.
SS:  He wouldn't give nothing up like he just kicked up.  I don't know.  We said kick you in the head or something.  Now you listen to me, he just wouldn't buckle though.
CJ:  Why, what happened?  What did you go there for?  What was there?  Did you know what was there?
SS:  The safe.  We were going to do the safe.
CJ:  And what, there was money in it?
SS:  Yeah there was money in the safe.
CJ:  How much - like he went before didn't he I heard?
SS:  Yeah like the boys had done it before but they just couldn't get it like, the safe was Fort Knox it just wouldn't move.  We had fuckin anything, tried to bust it open, just wouldn't bust open you know.
CJ:  And then what fuckin?
SS:  Don't know.  I just tried everything but I just couldn't open the cunt.
SS(as said):  It was like all little safety deposit boxes and everything.
DH:  You know like you go to the post office?
CJ:  Yeah.
DH:  And you've got your little deposit boxes all little squares.
CJ:  Yeah.
DH:  Like that.
CJ:  How big was the cunt?
SS:  It was probably from about edge to edge about 5 or 6 across there, 6 there.
SS(as said):  Yeah but like it was like a bundle like that there.  It was like all twenties.  Brand new straight out of the bank, you know all twenties.
DH:  He would have been loaded that cunt.
SS:  Five cent pieces like a tin of notes, 10 cents, 20 cents.  
CJ:  What did he do?
SS:  Don't know - don't know what he does.
CJ:  I don't know.
SS:  Yeah Poochie was just going on with him.
DH:  Fuckin Poochie was going on with him.
SS:  The boys were off their cunts.  I was only smoking that day.
CJ:  What happened?
SS:  Fuckin I went to the back door.  Old fellow was sitting down.  Old bloke's just like fuckin like the door was locked first and we made a bit of a noise and the old bloke came out and we go up and we go 'open the door up' hassling, bang just ripping into it, smashing it, 'just open up'.  Plus I think he cut himself I think old mate, stabbed him or something you know.
Someone said:  Poochie?
SS:  Yeah just picked him up then come up here.  So we took him up to the room 'open up, open it up, open up we need money mate'.  He wouldn't do anything.  He goes whack - whack him on the thing, you know.
DH:  I'm telling you, you listen that's nothing but.
SS:  Whack Poochie goes, listen bro.
DH:  You should see how made this cunt is bro.
SS:  That wouldn't work so he held a knife under there.
CJ:  Butcher knife?
SS:  No like - like one of them.
DH:  Yeah one of them fuckin meat cleavers.
CJ:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
SS:  Yeah they were slapping him you know, slapping him.
CJ:  Oh cutting him or just slapping him?
SS:  Yeah slapping him first and he wouldn't listen, said 'open that here', wouldn't listen.
CJ:  Who?
SS:  Ray, Ray, Ray - then fuckin Pooch yeah, fuckin I don't know, cunt wouldn't listen, kept going and going and going and going.
CJ:  What how bad was the cut?
SS:  Oh.
DH:  Decent hey?
SS:  Oh probably about that far in or something you know.
SS:  The old cunt, he was a stubborn cunt, he just wouldn't... 
CJ:  What did he do after that?
SS:  What?
CJ:  What did he do when you whacked him?
SS:  Went 'ah, ah, ah, fuck you know then they're fuckin....lower....their....voice, fuck this, done it all for nothing.  I kept trying, kept going outside to have a look, make sure no cunts was there.  The other boys are in there, they've got him, one's there, one's there, whack, whack him again.
CJ:  Whack him on the head?
SS:  Yeah whacking him on the head.
CJ:  What he's not going to tell you then?
SS:  That's what I was trying to tell him but they were off their cunts drunk, smashed, blind drunk.
CJ:  And what they wouldn't fuckin.
M:  That's what I mean, silly cunt whacking people around the head.
CJ:  You just whack them in the body mate so you don't hurt them.
DH:  Poochie jumped off a bench hey.
SS:  Oh yeah like, like anyway.
SS:  Like chair there, then like a cabinet and another cabinet up there.
DH:  About as high as the fridge.
SS:  About as high as the fridge, Pooch ended up off the ground rah, rah, rah, rah, whack.  A few more strokes to the head.  After that breathing air, just here and there you know.
CJ:  What, having a fit?
SS:  No just like choking on.
DH:  Choking on blood and froth.
SS:  Blood and froth and spew and that.
CJ:  What youse do?
SS:  I got him down and I tried to clear his airways and that you know. Yeah, I tried to clear his airways, just I don't know.
CJ:  How long were you there for?
SS:  About half an hour, 45 minutes.  I was even bored when we came out.
26Nowhere in any of these statements did the offender say that he had assaulted Mr Davies.  I accept that there is no evidence that he did.  What the offender told his friends, however, shows that he played a much larger role than he described to Ms Duffy.  I do not accept that he thought that when they found Mr Davies at home the others would leave.  The statements:
""We said kick you in the head or something.""
""We were going to do the safe.""
""Just tried everything but I just couldn't open.
""We go open the door up hassling bang, just ripping into it, smashing it just open up"", and
""So we took him up to the room, open it up, open up we need money mate"",
show that the offender was very much engaged with the other two in threatening Mr Davies that he would be assaulted and trying to rob him.  The extract shows also that the offender was keeping a lookout, but the statement ""I kept trying, kept going outside to have a look"" shows that he was doing far more than keeping a lookout, contrary to the thrust of what he told Ms Duffy.
27As the very description of his activities at the Cowles house shows, his role was central to the activities of the attackers on that occasion.  
28Mr Lange submitted that the deprivation suffered by the offender in his formative years, particularly having regard to his Aboriginality, mitigated his criminality.  Mr Lange pointed to the circumstances obtaining up to the time when the offender's mother gave him and his sister into the care of his grandmother.  He pointed to the conditions existing in the offender's grandmother's household and the violence done there to the offender.
29I accept that until he was three years old, the offender was exposed to the argumentative fights of his drunken parents and that occasionally he witnessed violence.  The evidence of conditions in his grandmother's house however is less clear.  
30The offender's mother, Mrs Rosemary Smith, gave evidence.  She said that she had thought it better for the offender and his sister to live in her mother's house.  She was reluctant, however, to accept that as things turned out the offender had been better off there.  I received the impression that she was not well acquainted with his life there.  She did not say that she had herself witnessed circumstances in the house.  She seemed to know nothing of his progress through school.  She reported his statement that one of his uncles had hit him but she did not know the detail of it.
31No evidence was adduced from anyone with direct knowledge of conditions in the offender's grandmother's household while the offender was living there.  I accept that Richard Smith lived there.  He used heroin, was violent and had a poor criminal record.  It may also be accepted, as Mrs Smith told the Court, that two other of her sons have a criminal record, but it does not appear that they resided in or were connected with the household where the offender was living.
32Ms Duffy is of the opinion that the offender's exposure to violence in his early years has had a profound effect on his emotional development.  In her opinion, his social learning was shaped by his cousins and the result was that he became involved in criminal activity from his early years and always in their company.
33I think that the account given to Ms Duffy by the offender overstated the position.  While I accept that his exposure to violence in his early years might have affected his emotional development, I do not accept that it was profound or long-lasting.
34While I accept that his cousins contributed to his social learning, I do not accept the implication in Ms Duffy's opinion that it was only they who shaped his social learning.  The offender attended primary school and high school until late in year 9.  Presumably, he was there exposed to other influences.  There is no evidence about them.  The Court has been asked to determine these important matters on an opinion based only on the offender's untestable assertions of fact.  It is possible that the offender was telling Ms Duffy the truth, but I am not confident that he was.  
35I accept the offender's assertion to Ms Duffy that he tried to clear Mr Davies' airways.  The evidence of the recorded conversation shows that he told his colleagues something of the kind and I think that he was there trying to tell the truth.
36I do not however accept that the offender would have called but did not call an ambulance for Mr Davies because he was dissuaded by Richard Smith from doing so.  There is no acceptable evidence to support that assertion.  The fact that he did not alert the authorities during the long time before Mr Davies' family discovered him speaks against a desire to do so.
37Objectively the attack on Mr Davies was vicious.  It was carried out in company.  Mr Davies was alone and helpless in his own home.  He was easily overpowered.  There was nothing complicated about the plan but the participants well knew what the object was.  They would join in breaking, entering and stealing what they could find.  
38They threatened to assault Mr Davies in an attempt to achieve their object.  They realised that he might resist.  When he did they persisted and gave effect to their threats.  They did not go armed to the house but used objects they found there to use for weapons.  The injuries inflicted on Mr Davies were cruel.  He was callously abandoned.  The whole procedure took some considerable time, perhaps up to forty-five minutes.
39I am satisfied that the offender willingly joined in the enterprise.  He needed to do so to raise money to buy the drugs he desired.  He knew the object of the arrangement was to induce Mr Davies to hand over his money.  His role included but was not confined to being a lookout.  He joined in threatening Mr Davies with assault.  He was present attempting robbery while the others laid into Mr Davies.  
40The attack carried out on Mr and Mrs Cowles was a vicious one, done in company.  The victims were helpless in the face of the strong young men they faced in their own home.  They were easily overcome.  Mr Cowles was beaten.  Fortunately, his injuries were not of a permanent kind.
41Mr and Mrs Cowles were affected in the way I have described.  On that occasion, the offender's role was more central than in the attack on Mr Davies.  He was present when Mr Cowles was beaten.  He alone was responsible for forcing Mrs Cowles to withdraw her money and hand it over, and consequently his telling Mrs Cowles that he was sorry carries no weight.  If he had been genuinely sorry he would not have treated her in such a discourteous way and would not have run away with her money.
42The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life.  The standard non parole period is twenty years.  I bear those matters in mind.  Richard Smith was convicted and sentenced for the murder of Mr Davies.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-two years and eleven months, a period incorporating a non-parole period of seventeen years and two months.  He had pleaded guilty at a rather earlier stage of his prosecution than the offender.  Schmidt J reduced his sentence on that account by eighteen per cent.  Like the offender, Richard Smith was a mature or maturing man with a substantial criminal record.
43The aggravating features in Richard Smith's case were that the offence was carried out by the use of a weapon in company in the victim's home against an old and therefore vulnerable man and that the offender was at the time on parole.
44Those aggravating features are present here.  The offender pleaded guilty as his trial was due to begin and he is consequently entitled to consideration for the utilitarian value of his plea.  There will be a discount at the bottom of the customary range.
45The part played by Richard Smith in the murder was greater than that played by the offender.  I am satisfied that Richard Smith and Kennedy assaulted Mr Davies and that the offender did not.  So Richard Smith played a somewhat greater role than the offender, though I have in mind that the offender participated willingly and for his own advantage.
46An argument arose on sentence whether the proper basis for sentencing was that the offender was a member of a joint criminal enterprise and that in the execution of the enterprise Mr Davies was killed with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, or whether Mr Davies died by the act of one of the participants in the course of the execution of an enterprise to commit an offence of appropriate seriousness, generally called constructive murder.
47I note that para 2 of the offender's written submissions included this:
The plea of guilty to murder was entered on the basis that Mr Smith was a participant to a joint criminal enterprise to rob and remained a participant when the actions of his co-accused [were] such that the possibility of grievous bodily harm was apparent.
48I would have thought that that was the appropriate way to regard the matter.  In any case, the distinction is irrelevant for sentencing purposes.  Either formulation would lead to a conviction for murder.  The offender is to be sentenced as responsible for the resulting murder with particular regard to the part he played.
49Having in mind her interview with the offender and the test results, Ms Duffy considered that there was a moderate to high risk of recidivism, that there was a need for his participation in programs to manage his abuse of alcohol and other drugs and that there was a pressing need to come to grips with his submission to peer pressure.  She observed that there were more general needs to deal in a structured way with the offender's misconduct and involvement in crime.  
50I accept that there is a need to manage the offender's devotion to the abuse of alcohol and other drugs and to moderate his attitude to the commission of offences.
51I accept that the offender is remorseful.  Evidence of what he said to his mother and to Ms Duffy, supported by his account to his friends in the recorded conversation, shows that notwithstanding the part he played in the attack on Mr Davies, he attempted to relieve his suffering.
52It was not submitted that the offender's low verbal intelligence score should lead to the conclusion that he was not a suitable subject for the imposition of a generally deterrent sentence, or that his verbal difficulties would make service of his sentence more onerous.
53I cannot conclude that there are reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.  I note Ms Duffy's opinion about the capacity of the offender for training, but against that has to be considered the risk of recidivism.  I cannot here and now predict how the offender will respond to the counselling and training and other assistance he will be offered while in custody.
54Although his record does not assist him, I do not think that it should be regarded as an aggravating feature of itself.  It does bear however upon his prospects of turning around.  
55I propose to impose sentences accumulated on the non-parole period of the offender's latest sentence in the District Court.  It expired on 7 August 2013.  The sentences I shall impose for the present offences will be partly accumulated on each other.  I shall for that reason disturb the prima facie statutory relationship between the non parole period and the parole period of the last occurring sentence.
56It was not submitted that any circumstance other than this inevitable accumulation of sentences justified any adjustment of the ordinary ratio between the non-parole and the parole components of the total effective sentence.  I do not think that there is any other such circumstance.
57A victim impact statement was read by Ms Tarr on behalf of herself and the brothers of Mr Davies.  They are aware, I think, that the Court cannot take their suffering into account in sentencing the offender, but it does extend its sympathy to them in their loss and grief.
58Steven John Smith for the robbery of Mr and Mrs Cowles and for the robbery of Mrs Cowles, I sentence you to imprisonment for eight years.  The sentences will be concurrent, commencing on 8 August 2013.  On each sentence I set a non-parole period of six years, expiring on 7 August 2019.
59For the murder of Mr Davies, I sentence you to imprisonment for twenty years, commencing on 8 August 2016 and expiring on 7 August 2036.  I set a non-parole period of fourteen years, expiring on 7 August 2030.  The earliest day upon which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 7 August 2030.

2762721,Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: Ade Sutiawan Bin Sulaeman (""the appellant"") was found guilty by a jury on 25 July 2012 of an offence of aggravated people smuggling. 

3Section 233C of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. The appellant was sentenced on 26 July 2012 to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. These were the minimum periods the judge was permitted to impose: s 236B. 

4The appellant now appeals against his conviction upon grounds contending errors by the trial judge, her Honour Judge Hock, in admitting evidence of a confession and in directing the jury about the essential elements of the offence.

5There is also an application for leave to appeal against sentence. However, the Court was informed at the commencement of the hearing that this was not being pursued and was filed in order to preserve the appellant's rights in the event that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions were overturned in a case then pending in the High Court of Australia. Judgment was given in that matter on 11 October 2013. The appeal failed: Magaming v The Queen [2013] HCA 40.

Facts

6Late in the evening on 12 October 2010, the Royal Australian Navy (""the Navy"") detected a vessel almost five nautical miles from Christmas Island. It was about seven nautical miles within Australian territorial waters. Naval officers delayed boarding the vessel for about an hour and a half because of the prevailing seas. 

7There were 57 passengers on board who derived from Middle Eastern countries and had no lawful right to enter Australia, as well as two Indonesian nationals who comprised the crew. The vessel had been travelling for about three days. It was overloaded and leaking. 

8The appellant was in charge of the vessel. There was no dispute that he was steering it and, when necessary, fixed or maintained the engines. 

9There was no dispute in the trial about most of the essential elements of the offence: that the appellant facilitated the bringing to Australia of five or more persons who had no lawful right to enter Australia and that he was reckless as to whether they had a lawful right to come to Australia. In written submissions to this Court, the Crown helpfully summarised the essence of the evidence that has no direct bearing upon either of the grounds of appeal:

(1) The passengers embarked at night in two small vessels from a beach in Indonesia, each having travelled from elsewhere.

(2) After travelling some distance, the passengers transferred from those boats onto the larger vessel that was to take them to Australia.

(3) The two crew were already on the vessel (an older and younger person).

(4) The vessel was a wooden fishing vessel (with no fishing equipment on board) and was about 15 metres long and 2.5 metres wide. There was no real seating, no beds, not enough life jackets, nowhere to cook, no toilet, and limited shelter.

(5) The appellant did most of the steering and repaired the engines.

(6) The younger crewman provided the passengers with food and relieved the appellant in steering the vessel.

(7) There was a compass on the vessel which the appellant used. (There was controversy about whether there was also a GPS device).

(8) A passenger fell overboard during the voyage and the vessel went back to collect him.

(9) The voyage was about three to four days before they were intercepted by the Navy.

(10) When they saw the Navy they turned the light on so the Navy could see them to come and get them. The applicant was turning the light on and off, flashing it.

(11) The passengers were happy when the Navy arrived as they had reached the place they wanted to be taken to, Australia.

(12) The passengers gave the crew money.

10The critical issue in the trial was whether the appellant meant to facilitate the bringing to Australia of the passengers. In other words, there was an issue about his knowledge or belief about the intended destination of the passengers.

11Four of the passengers gave evidence for the Crown. None of them spoke the appellant's language and he did not speak theirs. A lot of the communication between him and themselves that they gave evidence of involved gestures.

12One of the passengers, Mahrab Abadi, gave evidence that on the third day of the journey he asked when they were to arrive in Australia. Mr Abadi was speaking in Persian and using his hands. But he pronounced the word ""Australia"" in its English form. He said the ""older driver"" (the appellant) responded with his head in a nodding gesture.

13Mr Abadi said that on the last day of the journey some of the passengers were arguing with the older one and asking why they had not arrived at their destination yet.

Q. During that exchange did you hear the word ""Australia""?
A. INTERPRETER: Yes, I did, actually they were talking and asking that, why we didn't arrive to Australia? Would you please explain in that when we were boarded on the boat in the first state we were thinking that Christmas Island is very close to Australia and usually we were - we were using the ""Australia"", not ""Christmas Island"". 

14In cross-examination, Mr Abadi said that when land came within sight, the older crew member pointed to it and said ""Christmas Island"" or perhaps only ""Christmas"". 

15Ayub Allahdari said that on the first day of the journey he said to the older crew member, ""'Australia', 'finish' or something"". He was trying to find out when they would arrive at their destination. Although he was speaking in Kurdish, he used the English word ""Australia"". The appellant responded with a hand gesture. At some point (the evidence is unclear), the appellant spoke the words ""Christmas"" and ""Christmas Island"". 

16Mr Allahdari's evidence included: ""Actually we didn't know where we were doing [sic] at that time, just he answered 'Australia', mentioned to us 'Christmas Island' but we didn't know what mean 'Christmas Island' for us"". 

17In the context of some rather confusing evidence about a mobile phone and a GPS device, Mr Allahdari gave this evidence:

Q. When you say they check the two numbers, on what devices were the two numbers?
A. WITNESS: The mobile with the GPS one. And he said, we arriving, like, we are in Christmas Island. After this he see the - the numbers.

Q. When you say he said, we are arriving at Christmas Island, did you understand that from his hand gestures?
A. WITNESS: Yes, Christmas, Christmas. Just we listen, like, this word, ""Christmas, Christmas"" and after we know what is that. 

Q. what was he doing with his hands when -
A. WITNESS: He hands like showing the one way and saying ""Christmas"" and three, four hours we saw like a red light and, yeah, he said, we use the light or something like that.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: When the witness was saying ""Christmas"" he was pointing.

HER HONOUR: Yes, with extended arm. 

18In cross-examination the following evidence was given concerning the destination:

Q. You gave us some evidence that on the first day when during this discussion - during this questioning that the older crew member said something like Christmas Island or Christmas?
A. INTERPRETER: Correct

Q. Could you recall the exact words that he used?
A. INTERPRETER: At that time I remember when we asked about out how is the time, low time or I saw two lands. I remember two lands from that side to that side. He show me as by hand this is Christmas, this is I show you by hand.
A. WITNESS: Australia
A. INTERPRETER: Australia, Christmas.

Q. What were the exact words he used, can you remember?
A. WITNESS: ""Christmas"".
A. INTERPRETER: ""Christmas"".

Q. Do he didn't use the word Australia?
A. INTERPRETER: We ask, ""Where is Australia?"" He said ""Christmas, Christmas"". We ask, ""Australia"". He said, ""Christmas"".

Q. Can I suggest to you that it was the passengers rather than the older crew member that used the words ""Christmas"" and ""Australia""?
A. INTERPRETER: May be you are right.

Q. It's possible, is it, that he didn't use the words ""Christmas"" or ""Australia""?
A. INTERPRETER: Of course they say to us ""Christmas"" and ""Australia"". I remember that. I remember him.

Q. When you say ""they"" who?
A. WITNESS: The big driver. The older one and the small one, both of them said ""the Christmas"" and ""Australia"".

Q. Is your evidence that you have a memory of him saying the words ""Christmas"" and ""Australia""?
A. WITNESS: I didn't remember that. But I remembered he show us exactly the Christmas and say that ""Christmas"" because it was like the first day, like the afternoon time, the light is going from the two islands and he showed with the hand the Christmas and said ""Christmas, Christmas"". 

19Rahim Khoramian's evidence included that he heard the older crew member say the word ""Australia"" as well as ""Christmas Island"". This was when they were nearing Christmas Island. However, in cross-examination he agreed that he could not remember ""the older crew member kept saying the word Australia or Christmas Island"". He also agreed that in a conference with the Crown Prosecutor he had said that everyone was saying ""Australia"" but he could not recall if the older crew member was saying it.

20The fourth passenger witness did not give any evidence about the appellant saying anything concerning the destination of the passengers.

21The Crown also relied upon the evidence of Lieutenant Simon Griffith. He was in charge of the boarding party after the Navy detected the vessel near Christmas Island. He had a conversation with the appellant in which, on the Crown case, admissions were made that supported proof of the critical element. In short, it was alleged that the appellant admitted that the destination was Australia. It will be necessary to review Lt Griffith's evidence in some detail in the context of the first ground of appeal.

Ground 1: The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of alleged admissions by the appellant to Lieutenant Griffith and as a consequence the trial miscarried.

22The appellant's trial was assigned to her Honour Judge Hock on Wednesday 11 July 2012. The Crown Prosecutor informed her Honour that there were a number of preliminary legal issues to be determined, one of which concerned the admissibility of alleged admissions to Lt Griffith.

23Counsel for the appellant informed her Honour that the bases of the objection were ss 85, 90 and 139 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The Crown Prosecutor informed her Honour that s 245F of the Migration Act was relevant. Lt Griffith was then called to give evidence on the voir dire. 

Evidence of Lieutenant Griffith on the voir dire

24Lt Griffith was on a ship, HMAS Maitland, which was tasked to patrol Australian waters between Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef. His primary role was to be the boarding officer if a suspected illegal entry vessel (""SIEV"") was detected.

25On 12 October 2010 at 10.43pm, an alert was sounded on the HMAS Maitland and Lt Griffith prepared his boarding team, which comprised four personnel. They proceeded to the SIEV in a rigid hulled inflatable boat and, after some delay because of adverse sea conditions, boarded at 12.13am. They attended to some standard operational procedures, mostly concerned with safety and security of the boarding party and of the passengers and crew of the SIEV. 

26The engine of the SIEV stopped and was unable to be restarted. The inflatable boat then towed it to the shelter of Christmas Island. At about 1.24am they were moored at a mooring buoy and Lt Griffith commenced to interview the two crew members. Because of the language barrier he used Australian Fisheries Management Authority translation cards (""AFMA cards""). He did not use every card in the set; only those he felt were relevant. Seaman Murphy and Able Seaman Dempster took notes during this process.

27Lt Griffith was asked the purpose of the questioning:

A. The purpose was to gather information for standard reporting and signal purposes for us to provide information on the incident to headquarters northern command in Darwin and to water protection command in Canberra.

28The AFMA cards were numbered and contained questions in English with Indonesian translations. Cards 2 and 4 yielded responses from the appellant to the effect that he could not speak English but could read Indonesian. Card 3 asked who the master of the vessel was and the appellant made a gesture understood to mean that he was not.

29Card 6 asked for the appellant's full name and for him to write it down. He wrote ""ADE"" (his first name). Card 7 asked for his home address and the appellant wrote ""Marinjunqhilir"" (the name of the village in which he lived). At this point Lt Griffith made an assessment that the appellant understood the questions that he was being asked and that he was giving responsive answers. He then showed to the appellant card 8:

You are not obliged to say or do anything unless you wish to do so. Whatever you say or do will be recorded and may be given in evidence. This means you do not have to answer all my questions. Do you understand this warning? (Ensure this is acknowledged and understood and the response recorded). [Emphasis in original]

[Indonesian translation with apparently similar emphasis]

30The appellant responded by nodding his head in the affirmative, up and down. 

31Subsequent questions involved the appellant nodding in the affirmative to a question asking whether he was Indonesian (card 10); not giving an answer as to the name of the vessel (card 13); answering verbally that the vessel was registered or flagged to Indonesia (card 14); answering verbally and by gestures indicating the owner of the vessel was not present (card 15); not knowing the name of the owner or where the owner lived (cards 16-17); and indicating that there were two crew by holding up two fingers and writing ""Ade 34"" and ""Yogi 15"" (card 18) (the appellant was born in 1977 and he said in his evidence later in the trial that he estimated the other crew member, Yogi Bin Cutis, to be aged 15 to 20).

32The appellant and the younger crew member nodded affirmatively to a question about whether they were healthy (card 19). The appellant responded to a question asking him to produce ""official documents, passports, port clearances, licences, navigation charts etc"" in a way that indicated he had nothing to produce (card 25). 

33Questions about the home port of the vessel and where the journey had commenced brought the same verbal responses, ""Lombok"" (cards 26-27). The appellant held up four fingers in response to a question about how many days had elapsed since they had left port (card 28). He pointed to a compass when asked what navigational equipment he had (card 29). He shook his head in a negative fashion when asked whether the crew had a GPS device (card 30). 

34Card 34 asked:

Which country's waters are you in?

[Indonesian translation]

35Lt Griffith said that by way of response, ""the accused smiled and had a blank look on his face"".

36Lt Griffith gave this evidence on the voir dire about the final card shown to the appellant:

Q. And the final card you showed him was card 38: ""Why are you in this area?""
A. Yes

Q. Was there a response?
A. Yes, there was. He verbally said ""Australia"" and he smiled in a sheepish way.

Q. Did you do anything at that point?
A. Yes. To clarify his response, I also said ""Australia"", and, at the same time, I pointed - or gestured towards the passengers on board the vessel.

Q. And did the accused do anything then?
A. The accused looked down, continued to have a sheepish look on his face, and didn't appear to have any other explanation. 

37In her subsequent judgment, the trial judge indicated that the transcript was incorrect and that the appellant's verbal response to this question was ""Australie"". (The transcript varies in spelling from ""Australi"" to ""Australie"" but I will adopt the latter.)

38At the conclusion of the questioning Lt Griffith issued a detention notice pursuant to s 245F of the Migration Act. This was to formally advise that the vessel was being detained on the basis that it was reasonably suspected to be a foreign vessel in Australian territorial waters involved in a contravention of the Migration Act. 

39Lt Griffith also gave evidence on the voir dire that no-one in the boarding party spoke Indonesian and nor, to his knowledge, did anyone on board HMAS Maitland. He also said that he did not have access to an interpreter at the time he was questioning the appellant. The questioning had commenced at 1.39am and concluded at 2.45am. 

Issues canvassed in cross-examination on the voir dire

40Given the nature and extent of the submissions made in this Court about the admissibility of the appellant's responses to Lt Griffith's questioning, it is necessary to identify the issues that were raised in cross-examination of the officer on the voir dire. 

41HMAS Maitland's role was to detect illegal fishing and any other border protection incidents. 

42Lt Griffith was well-versed in his powers under s 245F of the Migration Act to board vessels, question people on vessels and, within reason, to compel them to answer. 

43There was specific clothing and equipment worn during boarding incidents such as this: a life jacket; a stab vest (combat body armour); a 9mm pistol with two magazines and a holster; a telescopic baton reduced to its smallest size of about 8cm in a pouch attached to the belt; a radio; a helmet; and a head lamp. All naval crew wore DPNU (""disruptive pattern naval uniform""). The stab vest was worn under the life jacket so that at that time of night it probably would not have been visible. 

44Lt Griffith was ""of a strong opinion that this was more than likely to be an illegal smuggling boat"". That was why the boat was boarded. 

45Firearms were not drawn when boarding the vessel. Lt Griffith's usual practice was to announce that he was an officer of the Royal Australian Navy and seek permission to come on board. Illumination of the boarding vessel was used to further identify that they were Australian officials. There was not a lot of yelling. It was a peaceful boarding; he was sure about that. 

46The suggestion by the cross-examiner that it was not a peaceful boarding appears to have emanated from some entries in contemporaneous notes - ""showtime"" and ""frenzy"" at the time of boarding and immediately after. Lt Griffith explained that these were in fact code words relating to the commanding officer's approval to commence boarding and to relay back that the boarding had been safely achieved. 

47The environment on the vessel was ""very benign"" and ""the mood was generally positive on board"". 

48Lt Griffith called out that he was from the Royal Australian Navy when he was boarding the vessel. He denied that other members of the party were calling that out as well. He denied calling out ""master, master"" and also denied that establishing who was the master was his primary function when he first got on to the boat. 

49Once he had observed who and what was on board first-hand he felt it was ""highly likely that this was a suspected illegal entry vessel"". That was his opinion but at this point the vessel was identified as a ""critical contact of interest and had not been ascertained as a SIEV yet"". 

50It was put to Lt Griffith that ""people weren't free to leave the boat at that point"". He pointed out that they were in the middle of the ocean and had nowhere to go; and the engine had stopped as well. 

51Several of the English speaking passengers pointed out the two members of the vessel's crew. He denied that this was as a result of him calling out ""master, master""; he again denied saying those words. 

52Lt Griffith denied that he immediately ""spotted the Indonesian crew"" when he got on to the boat. In effect, there were other more pressing matters at that point. He maintained, despite a suggestion to the contrary, that he had no direct dealing with the Indonesian crew until they were in the shelter of the island. He denied shining his light at the crew. He also denied that in response, the crew went to their knees and put their hands up. 

53The vessel was not detained at the time it was towed to the island; the s 245F notice was not issued until later. The boat was towed because it was without power; the seas were high; it was the middle of the night; and there was very little emergency equipment on board. Towing was necessary to ensure the safety of the vessel and those on board. He did not ask for permission to do this; but no-one tried to stop him either. 

54At 1.24am, the vessel was connected to a mooring buoy a short distance off Smith Point on Christmas Island. The buoy was about 40 to 50 yards offshore. It was suggested that it would have taken a very short period of time to get to shore, but Lt Griffith pointed out that while the distance was short, the land at that point comprised cliffs. 

55The use of the AFMA cards was standard operating procedure. Lt Griffith had received some limited training in their use as part of the boarding officer training course. He was aware that there were 87 cards and he selected the ones he felt were relevant to use. 

56Once the boat had been taken back to Christmas Island the element of risk had ""lulled"". ""That was when we could then begin inquiries, making investigations through asking the crew questions in order to gather information for reporting purposes"". He denied that there was ""no immediate urgency"" in speaking to the appellant at that time and he denied questioning him then ""because that was the next thing that you had to do"". He reiterated that his purpose was to gather information for military border protection command; it was ""the initial investigative part of the procedure in order to provide information for command, so they could make those decisions"". 

57Lt Griffith believed that the appellant was in charge; past experience with Indonesian fishing vessels and SIEVs told him that the older crew member would more than likely be the one in charge. 

58He was aware that it was possible that there were facilities on Christmas Island that could have been utilised when speaking with the appellant. But this was improbable, given the time of night. 

59Lt Griffith was satisfied that the appellant understood the caution card (card 8). He did not show card 9 which asks, ""Do you understand that you do not have to answer any questions if you do not want to?"" He did not feel it was necessary because the same question had already been asked with card 8. He was ""already quite happy that [the appellant] had answered [card 8] firmly and positively"". 

60Card 87 was not shown. It asks, ""have you understood all that you have read?"" Lt Griffith explained that the appellant seemed to answer everything as though he understood and he had already confirmed that he could read Indonesian.

61Lt Griffith did not seek clarification when the appellant only wrote ""Ade"" in response to card 6 which asked him to write his full name. As to the place name the appellant wrote in response to a question about his home address (card 7), Lt Griffith did not recognise the place and did not know if it was responsive to the question. 

62Although the two crew were together during the questioning, the older man answered every question and the younger man sometimes answered as well. Lt Griffith was asked if he was sure of this and he said he was. He denied a suggestion that at some stage only the younger person answered. 

63Lt Griffith agreed that when he showed the caution card (card 8) he was aware that it indicated that whatever the appellant said would be recorded and may be given in evidence. He agreed that the information the appellant was providing was not only for naval reporting purposes but ""was also for future use, if necessary"". 

64At no time was the appellant shown the contemporaneously written notes of the questioning. He had no ability to have them translated into his language. So, the appellant did not adopt them, or agree that they were correct. 

65Lt Griffith was aware that handheld recording devices were available on the HMAS Maitland; they were available for use by the boarding party; but he did not take one on this particular boarding. (The efficacy of audio recording, given the nature of the questioning by the use of cards, and the nature of the responses being often non-verbal, was not explored.)

Submissions following the voir dire

66In written submissions provided to the trial judge, the appellant's counsel summarised that the objection to the entirety of the conversation was based upon s 85 of the Evidence Act (the admissions were unreliable having regard to the circumstances of their making); s 90 (it would be unfair in all the circumstances to use the evidence); and s 139 (the caution given by Lt Griffith was insufficient and so the admission was obtained improperly).

67The use of powers under s 245F of the Migration Act was identified as ""a preliminary issue"" and one that should be taken into account in respect of each of the bases for exclusion of the evidence. The use of such power deprived the appellant of the protections in Div 3 of Part 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and deprived him of the right to silence. Failure to answer questions left him liable to penalty. Given that the officer in fact cautioned the appellant and did not direct him to answer any questions, it is notable that this submission was not explained or further developed.

Submissions on appeal generally

68It was submitted by counsel for the appellant (who was not counsel at the trial) that the evidence should have been excluded pursuant to ss 85, 90, 138 and 137 of the Evidence Act.

69The following then appears in the written submissions:

Additional issues raised in the appeal are: the lawfulness of the boarding of SIEV; what power was the investigating official (Lt Griffiths) exercising when he questioned the appellant, that is, under the Migration Act (Cth) or the Crimes Act (Cth); the extent to which s 245F(3) of the Migration Act abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination; the application of Part 1C of the Crimes Act (Cth) and the failure to comply with requirements regarding interviewing protected suspects or those under arrest; and the administration of the caution to a person who does not speak English. 

70The last of those ""issues"" is relevant to the way the matter was dealt with at trial. None of the others were issues that were raised at all. I will say something more about that later. In what follows I will deal with each of s 85, s 90 and s 139 separately.

Section 85 of the Evidence Act

71Section 85 is in the following terms:

Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants

(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:

(a) to, or in the presence of, an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence, or

(b) as a result of an act of another person who was, and who the defendant knew or reasonably believed to be, capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.

Note. [Omitted]

(2) Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account:

(a) any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and

(b) if the admission was made in response to questioning:

(i) the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and

(ii) the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.

Appellant's submissions at trial concerning s 85

72It was submitted that Lt Griffith was acting in the role of ""an investigating official"". The circumstances were said to be such that they would be ""extremely frightening for persons on the boat"" and, for a person in the position of the appellant who was not able to speak or understand English, the situation was ""even more frightening"". (Some of the ""circumstances"" referred to were either not established by the evidence on the voir dire, or the contrary was established.)

73There was no immediate need for the appellant to have been questioned and he required the services of an interpreter. The failure to provide an interpreter created a ""significant risk that the truth of the admissions was compromised"". 

74Further, there was no evidence that the appellant understood the meaning and effect of the caution. There was no clarification with him as to whether he understood. Card 9 had not been used for that purpose. The response to card 38 (""why are you in this area"") of ""Australie"" was said to be unresponsive and ambiguous. It may have been an admission but also may have been a request for ""clarification as to which area he was in"". 

Ruling of trial judge concerning s 85

75Her Honour accepted a Crown concession for the purpose of the argument that Lt Griffith was ""an investigating official"". But she said ""there is nothing in the evidence which would invoke s 85 of the Act"". The appellant was an adult and he could read Indonesian. The use of the AFMA cards was appropriate in the circumstances. The answers given to questions before and after card 8 (the caution card) were responsive. There was nothing about the nature of the questions, nor was there any evidence of any threat, promise or inducement that would enliven exclusion. There was no evidence from the appellant to the contrary of Lt Griffith's that he had responded positively to card 4 (that he could read Indonesian) and to card 8. 

76Her Honour concluded that the circumstances in which the admission was made were such that it was unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.

Submissions on the appeal concerning s 85

77It was submitted (AWS [23]) that exclusion under this provision was warranted because the circumstances affected the truth of the admission having regard to:

(a) the lack of an interpreter;

(b) the characteristics of the appellant;

(c) the manner of questioning - by an armed Navy officer who has boarded the SIEV; and

(d) contrary to the finding of the trial judge, the answers were not responsive and were not indicative of understanding.

78In relation to the last of those points, it was contended that care was required ""in a cross-language and cross-cultural exchange"" to avoid assuming that any ""response is conclusive of understanding"". The appellant's responses may have been ""little more than an act of gratuitous concurrence, possibly emphasised given the deferential nature of Indonesian people to persons in authority or elders and that the interrogator arrived armed and [in] a large Navy vessel"".

79The appellant was critical of her Honour's statement that ""as the accused has given no evidence there is nothing about the nature of the questions, nor is there evidence of any threat, promise or inducement, which would enliven s 85(2)"". This was a reference to the matters in s 85(3)(b) that her Honour was required to take into account. It was submitted that her Honour was wrong to confine to those matters her consideration of whether the evidence should be excluded. And it was submitted that ""her Honour was also in error in suggesting there was some onus on the accused to give evidence to raise issues which activate s 85(2)"". 

Determination

80Section 85 is not expressed in discretionary language. Admissibility of the evidence is determined by a finding of fact on the criteria in s 85(2) and the matters in s 85(3). Findings of fact by the trial judge are binding on this Court unless they were not open to her Honour to have made: Sepulveda v R [2006] NSWCCA 379; (2006) 167 A Crim R 108 at [131], per Johnson J, McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing.

81It was for the Crown at trial to establish on the balance of probabilities that the circumstances in which the admissions were made were such as to make it unlikely that their truth was adversely affected: R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; (2000) 112 A Crim R 201 at [46], per Wood CJ at CL, Foster AJA and Adams J agreeing; FMJ v The Queen [2011] VSCA 308 at [39], per Weinberg JA, Hansen JA and Beach AJA agreeing.

82The trial judge was well aware that there was no interpreter; that is why the AFMA cards with their Indonesian language translations were used. 

83The appellant was able to read the Indonesian language on the cards. His answers gave the appearance of being responsive. It is not determinative but it should be observed that, when he later gave evidence in the trial, the appellant did not suggest that any response he gave was unintended or mistaken because he misunderstood the question. There was no such evidence placed before her Honour on the voir dire; she only had the evidence of Lt Griffith in order to consider this issue.

84Arguments were advanced on the appeal that some of the appellant's answers, whilst not a complete misunderstanding of the question, were nonetheless indicative of only showing a partial understanding. One example was the appellant writing only his first name in response to a question asking him ""can you please write your full name"" (card 6). Another example was only writing the name of his village when asked ""can you please write your home address"" (card 7). The trial judge was aware of such responses. They did not compel a finding that the appellant was unresponsive, indicating that he did not understand the questions. In relation to the latter, counsel in this Court was unable to say what more could have been provided by the appellant aside from the name of his village. The appellant did not provide anything further in the course of his evidence before the jury.

85There is merit in the appellant's submission that care is required in considering responses given in the course of an exchange between persons who do not speak the same language and who emanate from different cultural backgrounds. But as to the argument that was based on that proposition, the obvious response is that there was nothing of that nature put to the trial judge either by way of evidence or submission. 

86The appellant's submissions concerning her Honour's reference to the matters in s 85(3)(b) are misconceived. Her Honour was required to consider those matters. She simply observed that they did not apply; there was no evidence about such matters that would support a finding in the accused's favour that the admissions should be excluded pursuant to s 85(2). It was a statement of the obvious, demonstrating compliance with the requirements of s 85(3), rather than a suggestion of reversal of onus.

87Whilst ""the manner of questioning - by an armed Navy officer who has boarded the SIEV"" was included in the summary of the appellant's argument in relation to s 85 (AWS [23]), it was not a point that was developed. It is correct that Lt Griffith was armed; he had a pistol in a holster which, presumably, was attached to his webbing. There was no evidence that the pistol was ever produced and no evidence one way or the other as to whether the appellant noticed it. And the only evidence as to the general atmosphere on board the vessel up to and at the time of the questioning was that of Lt Griffith which was to the effect that it was benign. There was no evidence on the voir dire that supported the submission to the trial judge that the appellant found the experience ""extremely frightening.""

88In my view the appellant has not demonstrated that the finding of fact by the trial judge that the criteria required by s 85(2) was satisfied was not a finding that was reasonably open.

Section 90 of the Evidence Act

89This section provides:

90 Discretion to exclude admissions

In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if:
(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and
(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.

Appellant's submissions at trial concerning s 90

90Counsel for the appellant submitted to the trial judge that the unfairness in this case concerned the failure of Lt Griffith to provide an adequate caution. This was said to have operated on the ability of the appellant to exercise his right to silence and came at a price that was unacceptable by community standards. Further, the failure to provide an interpreter impacted upon the reliability of the appellant's responses to such an extent as to make it unfair to admit them.

91Counsel pointed out that there was no urgency; an interpreter could have been found on Christmas Island; or at the very least a telephone interpreter should have been utilised. No steps were taken to ensure that the appellant understood the questions. The younger crew member apparently answered some of the questions (a point that lost its force after Lt Griffith gave evidence on the voir dire). It was also submitted that the appellant's responses were ""arguably non responsive and/or ambiguous"". 

92In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant added that another relevant factor was the failure of Lt Griffith to obtain an adoption by the appellant of the handwritten recording of the admissions and he relied upon R v Robinson [2003] NSWCCA 188 at [137].

Ruling of trial judge concerning s 90

93Her Honour noted that the onus of demonstrating that the use of the evidence was unfair was upon the appellant. She said she was not persuaded that the circumstances of the making of the admissions were such that it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence.

Submissions on appeal concerning s 90

94It was submitted (AWS [24]) that exclusion was warranted under this provision as it was unfair to use the evidence having regard to:

1. the understanding by the appellant of Lt Griffith's questions and the meaning of his answers; and

2. the lack of an effective caution.

95I have omitted reference to parts of the written submissions that are not reasons why it was unfair to use the evidence or were not issues raised at trial. The latter will be discussed below.

Determination

96In relation to each of the rulings of the trial judge concerning s 90 and s 139, the onus is upon the appellant to establish error in the House v The King sense (House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505): MIH v R [2007] NSWCCA 199 at [54], per Campbell JA, Hidden J and Smart AJ agreeing. 

97The provision in s 90 is concerned with the right of an accused to a fair trial and whether there is a risk of improper conviction: The Queen v Swaffield [1998] HCA 1; (1998) 192 CLR 159. It has been described as a ""final or safety net provision"" available after the more specific exclusionary provisions of the Evidence Act have been considered and applied: Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; (2007) 232 CLR 67 at [109], per Gummow and Hayne JJ.

98The trial judge's ruling in relation to s 90 was confined to a correct observation as to the appellant bearing the onus of establishing unfairness and a statement to the effect that she was not persuaded that admitting the evidence would be unfair.

99Earlier in her judgment she had indicated her conclusions about the ability of the appellant to understand the questions and the responsiveness of his answers. She was satisfied that the admissions were obtained in circumstances unlikely to adversely affect their truthfulness. Later, when dealing with s 139, she indicated her satisfaction that there had been an appropriate caution.

100A substantial argument was raised in this Court about the ability of the appellant to have understood the caution. But the trial judge was satisfied by the evidence of Lt Griffith that the appellant could read Indonesian, that he read the caution (on card 8) and that he nodded in the affirmative indicating he understood it. It is not to the point that there might have been other and better ways for Lt Griffith to have approached this issue. The simple point is that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that he was given a caution. Given it was Lt Griffith's evidence that the appellant responded affirmatively to the question posed at the end of the caution, ""Do you understand this warning?"", and there was no evidence to the contrary, it was also open to her Honour to accept that the appellant understood his right to silence.

101No error is demonstrated in the determination of the judge not to reject the evidence pursuant to s 90.

Section 139 of the Evidence Act

102This section provides:

139 Cautioning of persons

(1) For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if:

(a) the person was under arrest for an offence at the time, and

(b) the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who was at the time empowered, because of the office that he or she held, to arrest the person, and

(c) before starting the questioning the investigating official did not caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.

(2) For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if:

(a) the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who did not have the power to arrest the person, and

(b) the statement was made, or the act was done, after the investigating official formed a belief that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence, and

(c) the investigating official did not, before the statement was made or the act was done, caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.

(3) The caution must be given in, or translated into, a language in which the person is able to communicate with reasonable fluency, but need not be given in writing unless the person cannot hear adequately.

(4) Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply so far as any Australian law requires the person to answer questions put by, or do things required by, the investigating official.

(5) A reference in subsection (1) to a person who is under arrest includes a reference to a person who is in the company of an investigating official for the purpose of being questioned, if:

(a) the official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence that is to be the subject of the questioning, or

(b) the official would not allow the person to leave if the person wished to do so, or

(c) the official has given the person reasonable grounds for believing that the person would not be allowed to leave if he or she wished to do so.

(6) A person is not treated as being under arrest only because of subsection (5) if:
(a) the official is performing functions in relation to persons or goods entering or leaving Australia and the official does not believe the person has committed an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or

(b) the official is exercising a power under an Australian law to detain and search the person or to require the person to provide information or to answer questions.

Appellant's submissions at trial concerning s 139

103Counsel for the appellant submitted to the trial judge that Lt Griffith was an investigating official who had a power of arrest under s 245F of the Migration Act and, ""in all of the circumstances"", he ""had given the Accused reasonable grounds for believing he would not be able to leave"". For those reasons, it was submitted, the appellant was ""under arrest"" for the purposes of s 139.

104Counsel referred to R v Deng [2001] NSWCCA 153 in support of the proposition that the investigating official must give the caution in such a way that it is understood and that the official should ensure that it has been understood.

105Submissions were repeated about Lt Griffith not seeking clarification as to whether the appellant understood the caution, for example by the use of card 9. It was submitted that it was incumbent upon him to do so given the appellant's lack of English language skills and the absence of an interpreter. For these reasons, there was ""a failure to adequately caution"". 

106That conclusion then required consideration of exclusion of the evidence pursuant to s 138 (exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence). In that regard, it was submitted that the probative value of the evidence was not high (s 138(3)(a)). The appellant's answers were ambiguous and so its importance was not high (s 138(3)(b)). It was not contended that the breach by Lt Griffith was deliberate (s 138(3)(e)). But it was a significant breach and could easily have been avoided by delaying the questioning or by using card 9 (s 138(3)(h)). For those reasons it was submitted the desirability of admitting the evidence did not outweigh the undesirability of admitting evidence that was obtained in the way that it was.

Ruling of trial judge concerning s 139

107Her Honour was of the view that the section had no application as the appellant was not under arrest. But if he was under arrest, he was cautioned in accordance with ss 139(2)(c) and (3), that is, he was cautioned that he did not have to say anything but that anything he said may be used in evidence, and the caution was translated into a language in which the appellant was able to communicate with reasonable fluency. 

Submissions on appeal concerning s 139

108The appellant's submissions relevant to the issues raised at trial in respect of s 139 were:

1. there was error in the judge concluding that the appellant was not under arrest; her Honour failed to decide if he was a protected suspect; 

2. there was error in the judge concluding that the accused was cautioned in accordance with s 139(2)(c) and s 139(3); and 

3. the inadequacy of the caution amounted to illegality or impropriety. 

Determination

109The trial judge ruled that the evidence was admissible whether or not the appellant was under arrest. Accordingly, there is no practical utility in engaging in that debate. I do, however, express some bemusement as to how a person on a boat with a broken engine moored off cliffs in the middle of the night could have felt ""free to go"" anywhere, arrested or not. It does not seem a relevant consideration in these circumstances.

110The assertion of a ""failure to adequately caution"" the appellant was made in this Court by reference to s 23F of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). It provides that an investigating official must, before starting to question a person, caution that the person does not have to say or do anything, but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence. The same requirement appears in s 139(2)(c) of the Evidence Act.

111I have earlier set out the text of card 8. It precisely conformed to the requirements of s 23F and s 139(2)(c).

112There was no evidence contradictory of Lt Griffith's evidence that the appellant read the caution card and indicated that he understood it. The trial judge observed that he was ""extensively cross-examined but was not shaken in his account"". In these circumstances it cannot be accepted that it was not open to her Honour to find that there was no failure to comply with the provisions of s 139 and so there was no occasion to consider exclusion of the evidence pursuant to s 138.

113The arguments for the appellant in this Court in relation to this issue were very largely concerned with matters not raised in the court below. I will turn to them shortly.

Ruling of trial judge concerning s 137

114 Her Honour also considered s 137 (mandatory exclusion of prosecution evidence if the probative value is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice). She said that she did so ""for completeness"". No submission was made that this provision remained for consideration if her Honour was not persuaded to exclude the evidence on the other bases.

115Her Honour regarded the response of the appellant to card 38 (""Australie"") as ""clearly probative of a fact in issue"". Whether the appellant in fact gave that response, and what he meant to convey by it, were matters for the jury. Directions were to be given about this (and they were). There was no danger of unfair prejudice.

116I will not refer to the written submissions for the appellant about asserted error by the judge as to this provision. Her Honour only considered it as a matter ""of completeness"". It was not something that the appellant relied upon at trial. In effect, her Honour decided something that was not in issue. And, given her conclusions about the ss 85, 90 and 139 issues, it is difficult to see how the evidence could be excluded nevertheless under s 137.

Issues raised in this Court that were not raised in the trial court

117The Crown noted that this Court is a court of error and characterised the appellant's submissions as, in large part, seeking to reargue the matter afresh with argument that bore little correlation to the conduct of the matter below.

118I set out the above summary of ""additional issues"" provided at an early stage of the appellant's written submissions (AWS [9]). Within the lengthy submissions that followed were arguments raising the following propositions and issues:

(1) The boarding of the vessel was unlawful. There was no evidence of there having been a ""request to board"" which was required to be made by the commander of the HMAS Maitland and was a condition precedent to lawfully boarding a foreign vessel in Australian waters: ss 245F(1) and 245B of the Migration Act. 

(2) The trial judge did not determine what powers Lt Griffith was exercising when he commenced to question the appellant. Was it pursuant to s 245F of the Migration Act or s 23 of the Crimes Act (Cth)? If it was the former, there was a power to compel the appellant to answer questions. The judge did not determine whether the officer was exercising this power of compulsion. If the officer was purporting to exercise that power, there were a number of preconditions to its exercise which were not established; for example, effective communication of the consequence of a failure to answer the questions: s 245F(15).

(3) There was also an issue as to the derivative use of answers given under compulsion: s 245F(16).

(4) If the appellant was under arrest, or was a ""protected suspect"", then the provisions of Part 1C of the Crimes Act (Cth) applied. The judge held that the appellant was not under arrest; but failed to determine whether he was a ""protected suspect"" to whom the Part applied in any event.

(5) The provisions of Part 1C had not been complied with. The officer was required to caution (s 23F); the appellant was to be permitted to communicate with a friend or relative and a lawyer (s 23G); he was entitled to an interpreter (s 23N); he was entitled to access to consular assistance (s 23P); the provision of such information, including the caution, must be tape recorded (s 23U); and provisions relating to the recording of confessions and admissions had to be complied with if the evidence was to be admissible, subject to the court's discretion (s 23V).

(6) The appellant should have been asked questions like those suggested by Forster J in R v Anunga (1976) 11 ALR 412 at 414 to determine if he understood the caution. The Anunga guidelines should not be limited to interviewing Aboriginal Australians. 

119The submissions about these issues were pressed at the hearing of the appeal. The following provides the flavour. After referring to the alleged unlawfulness of the boarding, whether or not the questioning was under the compulsory powers in s 245F, and whether Part 1C of the Crimes Act (Cth) applied, counsel for the appellant submitted:

They in my submission are all factors that ought to have been taken into account when her Honour decided whether or not the answers of the appellant to Lieutenant Griffith should have been admitted in the exercise of the court's discretion, and it's my submission her Honour either erred in principle in the way in which she approached the various questions that required her Honour to answer, or that the findings of her Honour were not open on the evidence. 

120As an indication of a disconnect between the argument advanced in this Court and the actual evidence in the trial, senior counsel for the Crown referred to the contention that there was no ""request to board"" and contrasted it with the appellant's evidence that he signalled by flashing a light, hoping that assistance would come because one engine had stopped, the second engine was failing and the boat was taking on water. He was asked about how he felt when he saw HMAS Maitland and he replied, ""I felt happy and I asked for assistance"".

Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules

121Rule 4 provides:

No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.

122The rule operates as a substantial obstacle to ""armchair appeals"", as noted by a plethora of cases, including R v Ita [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340, R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321; (2003) 151 A Crim R 166 at [38], R v Button and Griffin [2002] NSWCCA 159; (2002) 54 NSWLR 455 per Heydon JA at [30]-[37], R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310 at [40] and R v King [2000] NSWCCA 507. Those cases relate to appeals where no objection at all was taken to the impugned decision, failure to direct or other matter. It is a reflection of a venerable practice. For an early example in this State, albeit in a civil context, see Newcomen v Corrigan [1880] NSWLawRp 80; (1880) 1 LR (NSW) 358 per Martin CJ at 360:

The principal point relied upon is that the Judge misdirected the jury in telling them that the defendant would not be liable unless she authorised the terms of the letter. The point is a novel one, and of great difficulty. But the proper course would have been to take objection to the evidence of the Defendant's instructions to her niece, when tendered at the trial. This was not done, and the Plaintiff cannot have the benefit of the point now.

123Leave to appeal a matter excluded by r 4 will only be given where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice: R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at [20], R v Abusafiah (1991) 25 NSWLR 531 at 536, R v Malas (1978) 21 ALR 225 at 232, R v Branscombe (1921) 21 SR (NSW) 363 at 367 and 378, and R v O'Brien (1920) 20 SR (NSW) 486 at 490.

124Reading the rule literally, leave would not be required to appeal an evidentiary ruling where objection was taken on any ground. That is, no matter how unmeritorious the objection that was taken at trial, an appellant is thereby free to raise any new ground for the objection on appeal. That cannot be the correct reading of the rule because it flies in the face of established principles of appellate procedure (as will be seen below). 

125Simpson J has grappled with exactly this issue in Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; (2006) 160 A Crim R 195. In that case, the appellant sought to raise an issue concerning s 165(2) Evidence Act in relation to evidence he had objected to at trial, but on other bases that those maintained below. The appellant's submissions referred to by her Honour in the following extract mirrored those of the appellant in the present case. She remarked, at 68-69:

On behalf of the Crown it was contended that no relevant objection had been taken at the trial, and that the appellant therefore required leave to raise the ground, and that leave ought to be refused. Counsel for the appellant agreed [sic - argued] that, objection to the whole of the statement having been taken, the conditions of Rule 4 had been met, and that leave was not required.

That raises an important issue as to the scope of rule 4.

126Then, at 73-74:

...counsel for the appellant argued in this Court that, once objection is taken, rule 4 has no further application. That is, that once objection - that is, objection of any kind, and on any basis - is taken on any ground to a particular piece of evidence, then rule 4 will not operate to prevent the raising of an entirely different objection to the same piece of evidence.

To accept the appellant's contention would be to cast an extraordinary burden upon trial judges...The proposition only needs to be stated to be seen as untenable.

127Simpson J went on to find that r 4 applied. Her reasoning was as follows:

(1) Admission of evidence involves a question of law.

(2) An appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the admission of evidence is based on a wrong decision on a question of law.

(3) Judges decide questions put before them by the parties.

(4) A judge cannot make an error of law unless a party asks him or her to make a relevant ruling (applying Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 per McHugh by analogy).

128Her Honour thus held that leave was required (at [78]). As an important caveat, the other judges did not endorse Simpson J's decision on r 4. James J at [17] and Hall J at [120] each expressed a desire to avoid a concluded view on the applicability of r 4 as it had not been fully argued.

129Shepherd v R [2011] NSWCCA 245 concerned the granting by a trial judge of an application by the Crown to cross-examine an unfavourable witness under s 38 Evidence Act. Defence counsel at trial opposed that course. The decision of the Court included (at [15]) that, ""Short submissions were made by the Crown and by trial counsel for the appellant which referred to ss.38 and 192 of the Act without any real elaboration"". One ground of appeal was that the trial judge had erred in permitting the adduction of a prior representation during the cross-examination. Different grounds were relied upon than those contained in the short submissions at trial. The Crown contended that r 4 applied and that the leave of the Court was required for the appellant to argue that ground, citing Vickers at [78]. The Court held, at [26]:

In our view, the breadth of Rule 4 is such that the appellant requires the leave of the Court to rely upon Ground of Appeal 2: Vickers at 208-210 [66]-[78]; Klein v R [2007] NSWCCA 206; 172 A Crim R 290 at 298 [27], 301 [45]-[46]. The draftsperson of the grounds of appeal identified, in the first ground, a challenge to the trial judge's decision to grant leave to the Crown under s.38 to cross-examine Scott Shepherd. Rule 4 does not apply to that ground [because it was a decision on how evidence could be adduced but not admissibility].

130The passages of Vickers endorsed were the ones summarised above.

131In the present case, an objection was raised to the impugned evidence. Specific reference was made to ss 85, 90, 138 and 139 Evidence Act, enlivening the consideration by the trial judge to find that the evidence should be excluded. But counsel did not argue the Migration Act and Crimes Act (Cth) points raised in this appeal in relation to any of those sections. The new points are technical, and were not ones that a trial judge would be expected to consider unless raised in support of the objection. 

132Rule 4 must apply. But my ultimate conclusion does not depend upon the rule alone.

Generally as to points not taken below

133There is a general requirement in an adversarial court or tribunal that counsel make clear the grounds on which they press an objection or seek some other a procedural or discretionary ruling. It is not the role of the court or tribunal to answer questions beyond the scope of the dispute articulated. At least in criminal trials in NSW, the only limit to that rule is the requirement upon the trial judge to ensure for the accused a fair trial according to law.

134Meier v R (unreported, NSWCCA, 21 May 1996) concerned the admissibility of evidence of a prejudicial identification. A resident of the small town of Weston complained to police that he was robbed. A suspect was taken to the police station to be interviewed. The complainant was also taken there shortly after; saw the suspect; and said, ""That's him"". The suspect became, in due course, the appellant. An objection to the evidence was not taken formally at trial, but was said on appeal to have arisen from an exchange between counsel and the bench. In that exchange, counsel very vaguely put to the judge that the identification was defective and evidence of it should not be admitted. Gleeson CJ (Dowd and Hidden JJ agreeing) rejected two grounds of appeal concerning an asserted failure of the judge to exclude the evidence in the following terms, which deserve to be reproduced in full, at 16-19:

As has been noted above, no objection was taken to the evidence in question as it was tendered. The informal, indeed casual, observations and submissions made prior to the commencement of the evidence cannot be regarded as an appropriate or sufficient method of putting before the trial judge, for his discretionary decision, the issues which needed to be canvassed relating to the admissibility of the evidence.

In R v Lars (1994) 73 A Crim R 91 at 119, this court said: 

""Where it is sought to explore on the voir dire the admissibility of evidence, the accused must make application to the judge for such an examination, specify the issues to be explored, and show, to whatever, extent the judge may reasonably require, that there is indeed a significant issue to be tried.""

When the trial judge, understandably, sought to bring the matter to a head by requiring counsel formally to state, for the purposes of the record, the nature of the application he was making, counsel responded by making an application which, as is acknowledged by appeal counsel, was unsustainable and bound to fail. Indeed, the very hopelessness of the application as expressed by trial counsel has been relied upon as an indication that counsel could not possibly have meant what he said, and that he should have been understood to have been asking for something different. However, the argument did not go so far as to suggest that this was an application for a voir dire examination.

Trial judges are entitled to expect from counsel that objections to evidence, or applications for rulings on the admissibility of evidence, will be made with appropriate clarity and procedural regularity.

For the reasons given above, the evidence in question in the present case was not self-evidently inadmissible, or of a kind that was bound to be rejected in the exercise of a proper discretion. Indeed, the trial judge was given only a perfunctory, incomplete and inaccurate account of what the evidence was. He could not properly have declared it inadmissible at that point.

If counsel for the appellant wanted a discretionary decision of the trial judge about the admissibility of the evidence then, in the circumstances, he should have applied for a voir dire examination or, alternatively, agreed with the Crown upon the facts which the trial judge was to take into consideration in making a decision. No doubt, the possibility of a voir dire hearing was one of the things the trial judge had in mind when asking counsel to state, for the record, the nature of his application.

The trial judge took at face value what counsel said by way of response to his invitation formally to state the nature of his application. The rejection of that application, which was bound to fail, did not require any reasons. Even if the application had been construed beneficially, as an application for a discretionary ruling, on the basis of what had been said from the bar table, that the evidence was not to be admitted, then the proper foundation for such a ruling had not been laid, and an adverse ruling, without elaboration, was justified.

If trial counsel desired to object to the evidence as it was given during the course of the trial, then such objection should have been made at the time the evidence was tendered.

One of the assumptions which underlies the adversary system is that counsel, in representing their clients, will make clear to the court or tribunal the points they wish to argue, and those they do not desire to press, and the procedural applications upon which they seek a decision. It is understandable that there may be, on occasions, a reluctance to be seen by a jury to be taking objections to evidence. If, however, counsel in this case wished seriously to press for the exclusion of the evidence in question, it was not sufficient to leave the matter as it stood at the conclusion of the exchange noted earlier. Counsel may well have thought that the discouraging remarks made by the trial judge in response to his observations meant that he had little ultimate prospect of having the evidence excluded. Even so, it was his duty to the client, and to the court, to make a properly formulated and presented application for an advance ruling on the evidence or, alternatively, to object to the evidence as it was tendered. He did neither of those things, and the complaints made in the first two grounds of appeal cannot be sustained.

135Gleeson CJ went on to describe the limits of the duty upon the trial judge where no objection or no proper objection is taken, in similar terms to my summary at [133] above (c.f. R v Pemble (1971) 124 CLR 107 per Barwick CJ at 117). 

136Another example of the nature of the duty of a trial judge concerning the admissibility of evidence that is not the subject of objection is provided by R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; (2008) 74 NSWLR 645. There it was held (at [29]) that a trial judge is not obliged to consider whether prosecution evidence to which no objection is taken should be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. It was recognised (at [30]), of course, that whether admission of the evidence constituted a miscarriage of justice is a separate issue.

137The case of R v Lars (1994) 73 A Crim R 91, cited above in Meier, involved, relevantly, a ground of appeal that the exercise of the discretion of a trial judge to refuse a voir dire on the admission of evidence of a confession was an error in law because the Crown had not shown that it was made voluntarily. There the Court held, at 114, that the argument should never have been raised on appeal. The Court pointed out that trial counsel had applied to the trial judge for a voir dire on the basis that the use of the evidence would be unfair, and disclaimed any suggestion that it was not voluntary. The Court relied upon Hawkins v R (unreported, NSWCCA, 17 December 1992).

138Hawkins also concerned a refusal to hear a (full) voir dire on the admissibility of a confession. Badgery-Parker J said, at p6:

The onus is on the Crown to prove that a confessional statement is voluntary but there must be some matter to raise the issue. In this, as in any other area of a trial and of an appeal, regard must be had to the nature of the issues that were in fact raised.

139Lars and Hawkins were cases about the discretion to grant a voir dire. But the statements of principle they contain are expressed broadly, and were certainly applied to their full effect in Meier. They reflect another facet of the principles of adversarial justice from which r 4 stems. A trial judge is entitled to, and counsel are obliged to provide, a proper foundation on which to base a ruling when asked to exercise a discretionary power. Objections to evidence are not at-large contentions concerning admissibility; they are vehicles for the raising of specific issues.

140This is a related concept to the principle that it is for the parties to define the issues at trial and that respect must be accorded to the decisions of trial counsel as to what evidence is to be the subject of objection, and the basis for any such objection.

141In the present case, if the ""additional issues"" had been thought to represent matters that could be raised to the potential benefit of the appellant, no doubt his counsel would have raised them with the trial judge and pursued them in his cross-examination of Lt Griffith. Lt Griffith would have been afforded an opportunity to agree with, contradict, or otherwise explain, propositions now put in criticism of his conduct. The Crown would have been afforded an opportunity to adduce other evidence it may have considered relevant to these issues. Absent such an approach having been taken at trial, I do not accept the submission of counsel for the appellant that there is a sufficient evidentiary foundation for this Court to consider and determine the ""additional issues"". The problem is the same as that identified by Barr J in Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 49 at [54]-[66] where a lack of evidence on an issue pursued on appeal but not at trial led to r 4 being applied and leave being refused.

142The ultimate question is whether admission of the evidence of Lt Griffith as to his interview of the appellant resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Having regard to the issues in the trial, and all of the evidence (and I have specific regard to that of the appellant in which there was not any real dispute about his understanding of the questions on the AFMA cards and the responses he gave) I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage. 

143Leave to rely upon the ""additional issues"" should be refused.

Ground 2: The trial miscarried as the Judge erred in failing to direct the jury it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:
(a) The Accused intended that the 5 or more persons be brought to a destination that was part of Australia; and
(b) That the accused knew the destination was part of Australia.

144I will elaborate shortly, but at the outset it can be said that this ground is based upon a contention that the jury might have reasoned that the appellant understood that the destination of the passengers was Christmas Island and that this was enough, regardless of whether he knew that it was a part of Australia.

145In Taru Ali v R [2013] NSWCCA 211 at [27], I set out the elements of the offence of aggravated people smuggling, deriving the same from The Queen v Amad [2012] NTCCA 1; (2012) 256 FLR 423, as follows:

1. The accused facilitated the bringing to Australia of a group of five or more passengers.

2. The accused meant to facilitate the bringing of the passengers to Australia.

3. At least five of the passengers were people to whom s 42(1) of the Migration Act applies. That is, the passengers were not Australian citizens; and at the relevant time they did not have valid visas permitting them to enter Australia.

4. The accused was reckless as to whether the passengers had a lawful right to come to Australia.

146It was clarified in PJ v The Queen [2012] VSCA 146; (2012) 268 FLR 99 that it was a requirement of proof of the second element that the Crown establish that the accused was aware that Australia was the intended destination of the 5 or more persons. 

147In Sunada v R; Jaru v R [2012] NSWCCA 187, the Crown conceded that the trial judge had erred by simply directing the jury that it was enough if the accused knew the destination was Ashmore Reef. 

148The same error was identified in Alomalu v R [2012] NSWCCA 255. Not only was the summing up erroneous but the verdict was also unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. McClellan CJ at CL observed (at [38]):

In the last decade the arrival to Australia of asylum seekers via boat from Indonesia is an issue that has received considerable focus in the Australian media. As a result, many Australians would be aware of the location of Ashmore Reef, know that it is part of Australia and be conscious of its significance as a port of entry for asylum seekers. Many Australians would readily infer that a boat that departs from a port in Indonesia with 78 passengers from Middle Eastern nations and charts a course in a southerly direction is likely to have a final destination of Australia. However, it is a different matter for a poor, itinerate worker from Indonesia. Knowledge that an Australian would have cannot be attributed without evidence to an Indonesian. The inevitable outcome is that I have a doubt about whether the appellant knew that he was facilitating the bringing of persons to Australia and that is a doubt that the jury should have had. The issue is not capable of being resolved adversely to the appellant by any advantage which the jury may have had. It follows that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

149In Taru Ali v R it was argued that the jury might have concluded that the appellant was only aware that the destination of the passengers was Ashmore Reef. In that event, the jury should have been directed that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware that Ashmore Reef was part of Australia. 

150I observed (at [51]-[52]) that the Crown case concerning the first two elements of the offence was squarely focussed on the question of whether the appellant was aware that he was facilitating the bringing or coming of a group of at least five persons to Australia. The defence case was that the appellant had never heard of Australia or of Ashmore Reef. He did not know where Australia was. He thought that he was taking his passengers from Java to Bali. When the boat had passed Bali he had no idea where it was going. He had been told simply to maintain a southerly course. As it turned out, the boat ended up at Ashmore Reef. 

151In my judgment, with which Johnson and Price JJ agreed, I concluded (at [55]):

Reference to Ashmore Reef in the evidence did not convert the defence case to something beyond what the appellant had said in his evidence or make a question of whether he knew Ashmore Reef was part of Australia an issue in the trial.

152A similar issue was raised by the appellants in Bin Radimin v R; Bin Zakhria v R [2013] NSWCCA 220. The appellants comprised the crew of a vessel that departed from Bali with 27 asylum seekers on board and travelled to Browse Island, some 180 kms off the coast of Western Australia. Evidence by passenger witnesses included that the appellants were heard using the word ""Australia"" as well as ""Ashmore Reef"" during the voyage. The defence cases were that the appellants did not know that they were going to Australia and did not intend to do so. Bin Radimin had been offered a job taking people on a holiday. Bin Zakhria thought he was taking passengers on a cruise to see the sea around Bali for 10 days.

153The Crown argued that its case was that the appellants intended to facilitate the bringing of the passengers to Australia and that there was no basis to isolate, as the appellants sought to do on the appeal, references to Ashmore Reef or Island so as to require an additional direction to be given that the appellants knew that it was a part of Australia.

154After a review of the evidence of some of the passenger witnesses, Hoeben CJ at CL, with whom Hidden and Fullerton JJ agreed, concluded (at [59]): 

What is clear from the extracts of evidence is that the references to Ashmore Reef/Island (which came from only two of the four passengers) were largely incidental and in context were used with other words such as ""Australia"". The preponderance of evidence was to the effect that the applicants were heard to use the word ""Australia"" and other expressions such as ""federal police"" in a context which allowed the jury, if it accepted that evidence, to conclude that the applicants intended to facilitate the coming to Australia of the passengers. In that regard, the characterisation of the evidence of these witnesses by the Crown should be accepted.

155For this reason, Hoeben CJ at CL concluded that the direction given by the trial judge was appropriate; the factual basis which would require an additional direction that the appellants were aware that Ashmore Reef was part of Australia was not established by the evidence.

156In the present case the trial judge directed the jury about the element of the offence in question as follows:

The Crown has to prove that the accused knew that what the accused was doing was assisting in bringing the group to Australia. That is, he knew that the intended destination of those people was Australia. So in deciding what the accused intended, that is whether he meant to bring this group to Australia, you need to decide what the accused knew about the passengers' intended destination at the time that they boarded the vessel or when he was assisting them to come to Australia. 

157Her Honour reminded the jury that the defence case was that the appellant did not intend to facilitate bringing the passengers to Australia. He thought he was taking the passengers to one or another place in Indonesia, Lombok or Enggano Island. On the other hand, the Crown case was that he was aware the passengers were destined for Australia, based upon the evidence of the passenger witnesses and upon the accused's exchange with Lt Griffith. 

158The trial judge warned the jury about the potential unreliability of the evidence of the exchange with Lt Griffith. She provided reasons why it may be unreliable and reminded the jury of the competing submissions of counsel. She told the jury that even if they accepted that the word ""Australie"" was said in respect to the question ""Why are you in this area?"" there was then an issue as to what the appellant intended. Was it a responsive answer to the question or was it simply the repetition of a word he had heard spoken by other passengers or by naval personnel?

159Her Honour also gave a warning to the jury about the potential unreliability of the evidence of the passenger witnesses. She highlighted for the jury's consideration that the appellant and the passengers did not have a language in common; there was no interpreter; no contemporaneous record was made of whatever passed between them; and the exchanges occurred during ""a stressful period of time for everyone on that voyage"". 

160It was submitted that the jury might not have accepted that the references to Australia attributed to the appellant by Lt Griffith and by the passenger witnesses indicated knowledge that the destination of the passengers was this country. The jury might have concluded that the references to ""Christmas"" and ""Christmas Island"" in the evidence of the passenger witnesses, coupled with the fact that (despite the appellant's evidence) Christmas Island was the intended destination of the vessel, indicated that the appellant's knowledge was confined to the passengers being destined for that place. In that event, it was submitted, it was necessary for the trial judge to give an additional direction that the appellant was aware that Christmas Island was part of Australia.

161The point was taken at trial but rejected by the judge. Her Honour said:

The way the case has been run, in my view, the case is that the accused knew that Australia was the ultimate destination. That arises from the evidence of Officer Griffith. It is going to unnecessarily complicate the matter.

It doesn't seem to me to be one of those cases where I need to get into that issue. Your client's case is that at all times he believed he was heading to Enggano Island. The Crown case is, I'm assuming based on the combination of the circumstances and what he said to Lieutenant Griffith. 

162The closing addresses of counsel, and the correct identification of the elements of the offence and the summary of the issues between the parties in the summing up were focussed upon the question whether the appellant was aware that the intended destination of the passengers was Australia. No-one suggested that it would suffice that the appellant was aware only that the passengers were going to Christmas Island.

163It was contended in this Court (AWS [108]) that:

The Crown case depended on proving either:

(a) the appellant believed the passengers were bound for ""Australia"" (and therein facilitated their journey) and it did not matter where the boat ended up, or

(b) the appellant believed the passengers were bound for Christmas Island and that the appellant knew that Christmas Island was part of Australia.

164 It was submitted that the words attributed to the appellant (""Australie"" and ""Christmas Island"") gave rise to two methods of proof as set out above: namely, either a belief that Australia was the destination or belief that Christmas Island was the destination and that it was part of Australia.

165It is noted that these submissions were identical to those that were made in Bin Radimin v R; Bin Zakhria v R: see the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [29]-[30]. 

166The Crown submitted that its case did not depend upon proving either one of the two propositions asserted in the appellant's submissions. Its case was always and only put by reference to the appellant intending to facilitate the passage of five or more people to Australia. References in the evidence to ""Christmas Island"" did not determine what the issues were at trial. It was not the defence case that the appellant may have intended to facilitate the bringing or coming of the passengers to Christmas Island but not to Australia. The factual basis that in some cases may require a trial judge to give a further direction did not exist in this case.

167The evidence relevant to this ground has been reviewed earlier in this judgment. The evidence of the passenger witnesses was to the effect that the appellant had referred both to Australia and Christmas Island. There was also the evidence of Lt Griffith, if the jury accepted it, of the appellant's answer to the question on card 38 which, if it did anything favouring the Crown, supported proof of the appellant's awareness of the destination being Australia. 

168In my view, there was no realistic prospect of the jury taking a selective approach to the evidence: being satisfied that the appellant was aware of the passengers' destination was Christmas Island but not aware of it being Australia. For the same reasons as the argument was rejected in Taru Ali v R and Bin Radimin v R; Bin Zakhria, the appellant's argument must be rejected in this case.

2762731,Radi v R [2013] NSWCCA 278,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceThe applicant was found guilty following trial by a jury of one offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).  The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
2On 23 June 2009 Sorby DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, and a balance of term of 3 years.  The earliest date on which the applicant is eligible for release on parole is 23 April 2014, i.e. in approximately 5½ months.
3The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence.  The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal:
Ground of Appeal:  The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
4It was common ground between the applicant and the Crown that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred in the sentencing process in that the sentencing judge had given excessive weight to the standard non-parole period and had engaged in a two stage sentencing process.  On that issue generally, this judgment should be read with Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.
Factual background to the offence
5At around 1pm on 10 May 2007 the applicant drove his motor vehicle to premises in The Avenue, Yagoona.  At the same time, a motor vehicle driven by a co-offender, Han, was already parked outside that residence.  The co-offender left his vehicle carrying an attaché bag, walked over to the applicant's vehicle and had a conversation with him before entering the undercover driveway of the residence.  The applicant drove after Han in his vehicle and remained in it outside the door of the unit which Han had entered.
6Shortly thereafter, Han left the residence and walked towards the applicant's vehicle.  Han had his right hand inside the left breast area of the black jacket that he was wearing at the time and it was bulging.  Han leaned into the passenger side of the applicant's vehicle and then moved backwards, away from the car.  His hands were empty.  
7The applicant was stopped by police a short time after these events.  In a black sports bag on the front seat the police found a plastic bag containing a yellow-brown crystal substance.  The applicant was arrested and charged.
8Analysis of the crystal substance showed it to be 991 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 74 percent.  That was 9 grams less than the amount which would have qualified as a ""large commercial quantity"".  The value of the drug on the street was variously estimated at between $175,000 and $495,500, depending upon how it was sold. 
9The following subjective matters were found by the sentencing judge.  The applicant was born in 1962 in Albania.  He is now 41.  At the time of his arrest, he was a single man and was working as a cleaner.  Before migrating to Australia in 1992, the applicant had been married but his wife and daughter remain in Albania. 
10The applicant had no criminal antecedents and suffered from diabetes, which was first diagnosed in 2000.  This condition on occasion affected his eyesight.  A psychiatric assessment was carried out by a Dr Sokolovic, who described the applicant as ""withdrawn and obviously [suffering] from reactive anxiety and deep depression. ...""  In Albania he had been subject to some political persecution.
11The sentencing judge was not able to find any other matters in mitigation of the offending.  His Honour did, however, assess the applicant's role as that of a courier, notwithstanding the amount of the drug involved.  His Honour found that the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness for this type of offence, but well above the low-range for such an offence.
12His Honour noted that general deterrence was an important consideration in the sentencing exercise because drug supply was far too prevalent in the community and a message needed to be sent to like-minded persons in the community that such activities would not be tolerated and that those caught face condign punishment.  It was against that background that his Honour passed the sentence already described.
Evidence of post sentence events
13The applicant provided an affidavit to the effect that he had been in custody since 11 May 2007, except for one month when he was on bail.  The applicant deposed that he had attended every course that was available to him while in prison.  On 3 December 2012 he started a job at Primo Australia's Scone Abattoir as an electrician in their maintenance section.  He said that none of his relatives are in Australia and this makes his time in prison more difficult for him.  He said that his mother was 80 years old and his father 85 and that he spoke with them by telephone most weeks.
Background to this application
14The applicant was sentenced on 23 June 2009.  He filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal on 25 June 2009.  On 6 July 2009 he submitted an application for legal aid to Legal Aid NSW.  The Notice of Intention to Appeal was extended until 29 May 2010.  On 16 April 2010 the applicant withdrew his application for legal aid.
15The applicant subsequently retained a private solicitor and counsel to act for him in an appeal against conviction only.  The appeal against conviction was dismissed (Radi v R [2010] NSWCCA 265).
16In January 2013 the applicant requested a review of his file by Legal Aid NSW.  This review took place which resulted in an application being filed on 3 July 2013 and this matter coming before the Court.
17Although the parties accepted that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred, the Crown did not accept that, pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law.
Delay
18The sentence was imposed on 23 June 2009.  The Notice of Intention to Appeal lapsed on 29 May 2010.  Accordingly, an extension of time of approximately 4 years is sought by this application for leave to appeal against sentence.
19The competing submissions in relation to delay, finality and the Court's consideration of those submissions are set out in Abdul v R at [31] - [53].  Those submissions and the Court's conclusions in relation thereto are incorporated into this judgment.
20The extent of the delay is substantial and the explanation for it is not compelling.  It can be inferred that when solicitors and counsel were retained to pursue the applicant's appeal against conviction, consideration was also given to appealing against sentence.  The fact that no such appeal was pursued suggests that a decision was made not to appeal against sentence because there were insufficient prospects of success.  The only change to those circumstances is the decision in Muldrock.  The principle of finality stands against an extension of time.  
21In those circumstances, the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion to determine whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted is determinative in this matter.  None of the other factors identified in the decided cases favour the granting of an extension of time.
Submissions
22Since ""Muldrock error"" was conceded by the Crown, the applicant's submissions focused on s6(3).  This Court was invited to re-exercise the sentencing discretion and to determine for itself, on the whole of the facts including post sentence events, whether a less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed (Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284, Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455;159 A Crim R 154).
23The applicant accepted the sentencing judge's characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence as ""below the mid-range ... but well above the low-range for such an offence"".  The applicant also accepted the sentencing judge's description of him as ""a courier"".  By reference to those matters and by reference to his subjective case, the applicant submitted that the sentence passed was simply too high.
24The applicant also relied upon statistics.  He submitted that out of 127 offenders who had been convicted of this offence, only 4 percent had received a sentence which was higher.  The applicant noted that in relation to the non-parole period, only 4 percent of offenders had received a non-parole period of the same length or of greater length.  The statistics relied upon related to persons convicted of this offence between September 2005 and October 2012.
Consideration
25His Honour's finding that the present offence fell below the mid-range was based on his acceptance of the applicant's submission that his role was best described as that of a courier.  That finding was open to his Honour.  Nevertheless, the qualifications expressed in R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425 (Wood CJ at CL, Howie J and Smart AJ agreeing) need to be kept in mind:
""4 As the applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, the Crown has not had the opportunity to test that account, and for the reasons discussed in R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 2001 and R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, it must be given limited weight.  I would add my voice to the dissatisfaction expressed in those decisions in relation to the wholly unsatisfactory practice whereby facts of relevance to an assessment of the role of an offender are sought to be proved through histories provided to third parties, which cannot then be tested.  If the applicant sought to establish that his role was that of a courier, then he bore the onus of establishing that, albeit on the balance of probabilities: Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 281. 
5 I am not persuaded in those circumstances that his Honour had any choice other than to find, as he did, that it was impossible to determine what role the applicant played beyond the fact of being the person who imported the drugs.""
26As there was no evidence of the applicant's precise role in relation to the supply of the drugs this was the only assessment open to his Honour, but in the circumstances it was a generous one.  It also needs to be kept in mind that at the time of his arrest the applicant had in his possession the sum of $2,800, 48 rounds of ammunition and 4 mobile telephones (3 of which were acknowledged by the applicant as belonging to him).  The finding that the applicant was a courier, rather than a street level dealer, did not significantly diminish his culpability.  As a courier, the applicant (who was not a drug user) was playing an important role in the distribution of the prohibited drug.
27The importance of the applicant's role can be inferred from the quantity of the drug involved.  Moreover, the purity of the drug was 74 percent.  As already indicated, the value of the drugs entrusted to the applicant was somewhere between $175,000 and $495,000, depending upon how it was distributed.  Although his Honour made no finding that the offence was committed for financial gain, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that was the only inference which was reasonably available.  In the circumstances, his Honour's failure to make that finding was either an oversight or was generous to the applicant.
28There was little in the way of matters which could mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence.  The applicant expressed no remorse or contrition.  As his Honour appreciated, specific and general deterrence loom large in drug offences such as these.  The offence was objectively serious and the damage caused by drugs, particularly crystal  methylamphetamine, is notorious.  The principles of specific and general deterrence in drug supply matters should not merely be paid lip service but given real effect.
29As this Court has said on a number of occasions, sentencing statistics are of limited value when used to challenge a particular sentence based on particular facts.  Some of these limitations were identified by the plurality in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 where their Honours said:
""54 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. ...
55 As the plurality said in Wong:
""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""""
30In Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 Adamson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said:
""45 One cannot adjudge whether a sentence falls within an appropriate range by reasoning from particular instances. Applicants will always be able to find cases where offenders appear to have been dealt with more leniently. So, too, will the Crown be able to find cases where offenders have apparently been dealt with more severely than the applicant for leave to appeal on sentence. This is not, however, the way in which this Court determines whether a sentence is manifestly excessive.
46 The sentencing consistency to which the law aspires is, as the High Court said in Hili, at [18]:
""...consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalence.""""
31As was properly conceded by the applicant, bare statistics are of limited assistance, particularly without knowing the facts of a case.  The statistics relied upon by the applicant show little more than that the sentence imposed on the applicant was clearly within the range of sentences previously imposed, albeit on the high side.
32While the applicant has behaved well in prison and has, in effect, been a model prisoner, there is nothing in the events which have occurred post sentence which indicates that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.  This is particularly so when so little of the sentence remains to be served.
33In summary, this was an objectively serious offence.  The quantity of drugs involved was very much towards the top end of the ""commercial quantity"" classification.  The nature of the drug was particularly pernicious in its effect on those who use it and, potentially at least, on those who come in contact with users.  
34Even allowing for the applicant's strong subjective case, for the reasons given even if an extension of time were granted, and if leave to appeal against sentence were granted, I am not satisfied that pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, a lesser sentence than that which was imposed is warranted in law.  In those circumstances, it would be futile to grant an extension of time.
35The order which I propose is that the application for extension of time be dismissed.
36JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
37LATHAM J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2762732,AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 273,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the order which he proposes.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, AB, seeks an extension of time to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 11 November 2009. Because of the Applicant's assistance to authorities, a non-publication order was made concerning his name in the District Court, and this judgment also utilises a pseudonym to describe him. 

The Offences and Sentences

3The Applicant pleaded guilty to two groups of offences. The first group, described as the Mandalong offences, comprised:

(a)an offence committed between September 2006 and March 2007 of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, (28.3 grams of MDA), contrary to s.24(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""DMT Act""), carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years;

(b)an offence committed between September 2006 and March 2007 of possession of a precursor (520.9 grams of pseudoephedrine) with intent to manufacture MDA contrary to s.24A(1) DMT Act, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.

4Taken into account on a Form 1 when sentenced for the s.24(1) DMT Act offence, were offences of possessing a tablet press (two offences - a rotary tablet press and a single-punch tablet press), contrary to s.11B(1) DMT Act. Also taken into account on the Form 1, were three offences of possession of an unauthorised pistol contrary to s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 and possession of a prohibited weapon contrary to s.7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1996 (a silencer).

5If prosecuted separately for these offences, the maximum penalties would have been for each offence: 

(a)the tablet press offences - imprisonment for two years;

(b)the pistol offences - 14 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years;

(c)the silencer offence - 14 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years.

6It will be apparent immediately that the Applicant obtained a substantial benefit by the placement of this range of serious offences on a Form 1 attaching to the s.24(1) DMT Act offence.

7Whilst on bail for the Mandalong offences, the Applicant committed the Kanahooka offence, namely between 4 and 20 March 2008, manufacturing a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (52.6 kilograms of MDP2P), contrary to s.24(2) DMT Act, carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

8Taken into account on a Form 1 for the Kanahooka offence was an offence of, between 4 and 20 March 2008, possession of a precursor for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (Safrole). If prosecuted separately, this offence under s.24A(1) DMT Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.

9For the Mandalong offences, the Applicant was sentenced as follows:

(a)for the s.24(1) DMT Act offence, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 30 September 2008 and expiring on 29 March 2011, with a balance of term of one year and six months commencing on 30 March 2011 and expiring on 29 September 2012;

(b)for the s.24A(1) DMT Act offence, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 31 March 2008 and expiring on 30 June 2009, with a balance of term of nine months commencing on 31 June 2009 and expiring on 30 March 2010.

10For the Kanahooka offence, taking into account the offence on the Form 1, the Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years commencing on 31 March 2010 and expiring on 30 March 2016, with a balance of term of four years commencing on 31 March 2016 and expiring on 30 March 2020.

11The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of eight years concluding on 30 March 2016, and a balance of term of four years concluding on 30 March 2020. 

12As will be seen, the sentencing Judge applied a total discount of 50% on sentence because of the Applicant's pleas of guilty and past assistance to the authorities.

The Present Application

13Having been sentenced on 11 November 2009, the Applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal with respect to sentence on 3 December 2009. Thereafter, the Applicant was refused legal aid and the Notice of Intention to Appeal lapsed.

14It was not until 28 June 2013, some three years and seven months after sentence, that Notice of Application for an Extension of Time for Leave to Appeal against sentence was filed in this Court.

15It is clear that the sole reason for this very lengthy delay is the revived attention given to the Applicant's sentences following the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""). 

16The Applicant seeks to rely upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a)Ground 1 - his Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock.

(b)Ground 2 - there is erroneous disparity between the sentence of the Applicant and the sentence of the co-offender, [XY].

17The co-offender is described by pseudonym as identification of him may serve to identify the Applicant.

18The Crown submits that no error has been demonstrated in this case and says, in any event, that no lesser sentence is warranted under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, so that the Court should refuse the extension of time application.

19The concept of Muldrock error was explained in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19]-[28]. What is said there will assist an understanding of the present judgment.

20In Abdul v R at [42]-[53], the Court considered the principles to be applied where application is made for an extension of time to appeal in a case such as this. This approach has been adopted in determining the present application.

Facts of the Offences

21Agreed Statements of Facts were placed before the sentencing Judge with respect to the Mandalong offences and the Kanahooka offence.

The Mandalong Offences

22Between July and September 2006, the Applicant (then aged 32 years) arranged for the leasing of a 50-acre rural property at Mandalong. For this purpose, false documentation was provided by him and a cover name was used for the leasing of the property. A number of buildings were located on the property.

23Between October 2006 and January 2007, neighbours observed the Applicant regularly attending the property. A false story was devised to explain the Applicant's presence on the property. The Applicant (using a false name) introduced himself to a neighbour, asserting that his uncle (allegedly then in the United Kingdom) was going to breed and train thoroughbreds on the property in six months' time.

24As would become entirely apparent from events on and after 19 March 2007, the Mandalong property was in fact being utilised for the manufacture of prohibited drugs. 

25In the early evening of 19 March 2007, the Applicant was inside the house on the Mandalong property when a vapour explosion occurred. The vapour explosion was the result of the Applicant's activities of ""cooking"" chemicals to manufacture a prohibited drug. 

26As a result of the explosion, the Applicant was covered in toxic chemicals and fled the residence. Once outside, he discarded his clothes, including a pair of shorts from which police later recovered the sum of $3,475.00. DNA analysis of the shorts later established the garment as having been worn by the Applicant. Further forensic examination of the shorts revealed methylenedioxyamphetimine (MDA). 

27The chemicals continued to burn the Applicant's body and he was driven to Wyong Hospital. The Applicant's condition rapidly deteriorated and he was transferred to the Burns Unit at Concord Hospital, with burns covering 65% of his body. 

28Later on the evening of 19 March 2007, the residence on the Mandalong property was engulfed by fire. Members of the New South Wales Fire Brigade extinguished the fire. No person was then present on the property. Fire Brigade officers observed what appeared to be the remnants of a clandestine laboratory. This consisted of a number of flasks atop heating devices and other glassware on the western side of the premises, the only area of the premises which remained standing.

29Police attended the scene of the fire and forensic chemical examination followed, revealing a substantial drug manufacturing operation, including:

(a)air purifying respirator filters found on the floor of the separate garage containing, amongst other things, MDA, MDMA and MDP2P;

(b)a methylated spirits bottle on the floor of the garage containing MDA and Isosafrole; 

(c)liquid from a 10-litre flask found on the floor of the garage containing 81.3% MDP2P;

(d)the hopper from a tablet press found in the garage containing MDP2P;

(e)the hopper from another tablet press on the floor of the garage containing MDMA and MDP2P;

(f)tablets containing MDA and MDMA.

30In the garage, police also located a vacuum-sealed bag containing 126 pink mottled pills stamped with a St George Dragon logo, weighing 28.3 grams and containing 24.5% MDA. 

31What has been recounted so far relates to the first Mandalong offence, being the s.24(1) DMT Act offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, MDA. 

32A large quantity of pseudoephedrine extract was located in the locked area of an open machinery shed. Analysis of this substance pointed to the extraction of pseudoephedrine from therapeutic products, as part of the illicit manufacture of methylamphetamine.

33A total of 88 kilograms of pseudoephedrine extract was located, which was calculated as being able to produce 520.9 grams of pure pseudoephedrine. 

34These facts relate to the second Mandalong offence, namely the s.24A(1) offence of possession of a precursor, pseudoephedrine, with intent to manufacture MDA. 

35In the garage near the house, police located four tablet presses, two of which had motors attached, together with an instruction manual entitled ""Secrets of Methylamphetamine Manufacture Including Recipes for MDA, Ecstasy and Other Psychedelic Amphetamines"". The Yogesh tablet press and the Shanghi tablet press were fully functional. These matters give rise to the Form 1 offences of possession of tablet presses. 

36Police also located in the garage a shopping bag which contained a .25 automatic calibre Fabrique Nationale self-loading pistol, a .22 Long Rifle calibre Bernadelli brand model semi-automatic pistol (with a silencer attached) and a nine millimetre .380 automatic calibre Astra self-loading pistol. Each of the pistols was in working order. The Applicant was not the holder of a firearm's licence or prohibited weapons permit. These matters gave rise to the further offences on the Form 1 of possession of three pistols and possession of a silencer. 

37On 3 May 2007, police spoke to the Applicant at Concord Hospital. After legal advice, he declined to be interviewed. A bedside court was arranged and the Applicant was charged. 

38The Applicant was granted conditional bail on 9 May 2007.

39On 21 May 2007, the Applicant was released from hospital and he continued to be treated for his injuries as an outpatient. 

40The Applicant remained at liberty on bail until 31 March 2008, when he was arrested for the Kanahooka offence. 

The Kanahooka Offence

41In February 2008, police from the Lake Illawarra Local Area Command, with the assistance of the New South Wales Crime Commission, commenced an operation to target a co-offender, XY, for alleged involvement in the manufacture and supply of ecstasy. 

42On 25 February 2008, lawful telephone intercepts detected conversations between XY and other persons involved in drug manufacture. 

43On 3 March 2008, a warrant was issued under the Listening Devices Act 1984 permitting installation of a listening device at premises at Kanahooka. The Applicant came to the attention of police as a result of monitoring of the listening device between 4 and 20 March 2008. 

44Over this period, the listening device recorded numerous conversations between the Applicant, XY and a relative of the Applicant, in which they discussed their involvement in a criminal enterprise to manufacture a prohibited drug. The men were discussing the sourcing of the premises, the purchase of chemicals used in the manufacture of ecstasy, problems encountered during this and previous ""cooks"", the pros and cons of various manufacture methods and the various stages of the manufacture process, as well as the non-use of mobile phones and the installation of a gate, and the parking of cars off the street, to avoid persons knocking on their door.

45The Applicant was heard telling the others about the burns he had received during a ""cook"" at Mandalong. The Applicant also discussed how close they had come at the Kanahooka premises to a fire and potential disaster, apparently avoided by pouring water over smoking equipment.

46Examples of recorded statements made by the Applicant included:

(a)on 5 March 2008, an instruction to XY to ""get rid of your phones"";

(b)on 6, 10, 18 and 20 March 2008, providing technical information concerning the manufacturing process including (on 18 March 2008) telling XY that, ""You can't really do nothing at the moment until you get the sass"". 

47On 20 March 2008, electronic and physical surveillance confirmed that XY, the Applicant and the third person were in the process of manufacturing five kilograms of ecstasy at the Kanahooka property, with intercepted conversations indicating that they were six hours into a 16-hour ""cook"". 

48In the late afternoon of 20 March 2008, the Applicant and his relative left the Kanahooka property by vehicle, with the Applicant as passenger. Police attempted to stop this vehicle, however, the driver drove directly at police, mounting the footpath before driving off at high speed, eventually crashing into a fence. Both the Applicant and the driver made good their escape, despite an extensive police search.

49Whilst police were securing the scene near the vehicle, they were approached by a member of the public who handed them a rubber glove thrown from the vehicle, with the rubber glove containing numerous other rubber gloves. Fingerprints were later detected on a glove. A search of the vehicle located a tablet container bearing the Applicant's name.

50XY was arrested on 20 March 2008 without incident. 

51The Applicant was arrested at the Burwood Local Court on 31 March 2008, after he had appeared in Court whilst on bail in relation to the Mandalong offences.

52A search warrant was executed on the Kanahooka premises with the assistance of specialist chemical operations officers. Inside the premises, police observed that three rooms contained equipment used in varying stages of the manufacturing process of ecstasy. 

53During the search, police located numerous items, including:

(a)scientific glassware and equipment used in the manufacture of prohibited drugs;

(b)several 20-litre flasks containing a liquid undergoing a chemical process;

(c)over 500 litres of chemicals that can be used in the manufacture of MDMA - scientific analysis of one container of those chemicals revealed that it contained 52.6 kilograms of admixture, containing at least 4,805 grams of MDP2P (the large commercial quantity for this drug is 500 grams);

(d)a further 52 kilograms of Safrole and 2.3 kilograms of Isosafrole, being scheduled precursors used in the manufacture of MDMA;

(e)a recipe on how to manufacture methylamphetamine;

(f)two vacuum pumps.

54According to the forensic chemical analyst who examined the premises and substances, with sufficient chemicals available, the maximum amount of MDA that could be produced from the substances located at the Kanahooka premises was about 65.4 kilograms, about 130 times the large commercial quantity for this drug.

55Approximately 4.8 kilograms of pure MDP2P could be converted into 4.8 kilograms of pure MDA. 

56MDA is generally sold in tablet form, and its properties are usually more intense and hallucinogenic than MDMA or ecstasy. MDA is generally passed off as MDMA. Police estimated the street value in this case to be between $720,000.00 (if sold in bulk) and $3 million (the street-level value). 

57The Form 1 matter taken into account on sentence for the Kanahooka offence arose from the location in the premises of 58.9 kilograms of Safrole, a scheduled precursor used by the Applicant in the manufacture of a prohibited drug.

58Of the various substances referred to in these facts:

(a)Safrole and MDP2P are scheduled as precursors because of their use in the manufacture of prohibited drugs such as MDA and MDMA;

(b)MDP2P is scheduled as a prohibited drug under the DMT Act, with the large commercial quantity of this drug being 500 grams;

(c)MDA is a prohibited drug under the DMT Act, with the large commercial quantity being 500 grams.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

59The Applicant was aged 32 and 33 years at the time of the offences, committed between September 2006 and March 2008. He is now aged 39 years. He is a single man with no dependants.

60The Applicant's criminal history included an offence of stealing from the person, for which he was sentenced in 1993 to 12 months' imprisonment by way of periodic detention. He was fined in 1994 for traffic matters.

61The Applicant had an uneventful upbringing in a supportive family environment. He obtained his Higher School Certificate. 

62The Applicant worked for a period as a tiler and became involved in property development. Evidence was adduced on sentence concerning financial difficulties arising from property development which affected the Applicant. He had borrowed money, using his parents' home as security.

63Medical evidence was adduced on sentence concerning the nature and extent of the injuries which the Applicant sustained in the vapour explosion at the Mandalong premises in March 2007. 

64In addition to evidence concerning physical injuries and disfigurement, psychiatric reports from Dr Stephen Allnutt were tendered on sentence. Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that the Applicant had manifested symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the explosion. 

65Dr Allnutt had seen the Applicant initially on 26 February 2008, whilst the Applicant was on bail for the Mandalong offences. Dr Allnutt was concerned at that time with respect to the Applicant's mental state. The second time Dr Allnutt saw the Applicant was when he was in custody after his arrest for the Kanahooka offence. At this time, there had been further deterioration in his mental state. Dr Allnutt considered that the Applicant continued to manifest symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms.

Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge

66It is appropriate to refer to a number of findings of the sentencing Judge. 

67His Honour allowed a combined discount of 50%, taking into account the Applicant's pleas of guilty and his past assistance, allocating 25% for each of these two elements (ROS20-21). There was no promise of future assistance and thus no discount in this respect. 

68A lengthy sentencing hearing (occupying some 111 transcript pages) proceeded before his Honour over several days in October 2009. The Applicant and other persons gave evidence. The Applicant asserted that he had played a minimal role in the Mandalong offences, and that he had only become involved in the Kanahooka offence to obtain information which would be of assistance to the authorities, and which would therefore assist him in minimising the penalties to be imposed for the Mandalong offences. 

69These issues were resolved adversely to the Applicant. The sentencing Judge did not accept the Applicant's evidence, finding that he was not a reliable witness on the topic of his own motivation for involvement in the Kanahooka matter. His Honour concluded that the Applicant had become involved in the Kanahooka offence as a consequence of the financial difficulties in which he found himself following the failure of a property development, and the failure of the Mandalong offences to provide a second source of income to cover his then financial difficulties. 

70The sentencing Judge rejected, as well, the Applicant's claim that he had played a superficial role only in the Mandalong offences, although the Court accepted that it was likely that there were others behind the scenes who were providing finance and ""pulling the strings"" (ROS23-24). 

71Fortunately for the Applicant, despite the fact that there had been a lengthy contested sentencing hearing at which factual findings were resolved adversely to him, the Applicant maintained the full benefit of a 25% discount for his pleas: R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 at [2], [27]-[33]. 

72His Honour noted the Applicant's injuries, which were taken into account as a form of extra-curial punishment in relation to the Mandalong offences (ROS26). 

73This Court has observed that burn injuries sustained by a person engaged in drug manufacture are capable of constituting extra-curial punishment to be taken into account on sentence: Alameddine v R [2006] NSWCCA 317 at [17]-[27]. It must be said, however, that any benefit which the Applicant may have been entitled to receive on sentence in this respect would be largely neutralised by his engagement, whilst on bail for the very offences in which the injuries were sustained, in an even larger drug manufacture enterprise. To the extent that the rationale for extra-curial punishment being taken into account on sentence where injuries are sustained in the commission of an offence is the expectation that that form of punishment will have a deterrent effect upon the offender, then that is clearly not the position in this case.

74The sentencing Judge took into account Dr Allnutt's concern about the Applicant in February 2008 as a mitigating factor on the Kanahooka offence (ROS22). Elsewhere his Honour considered that the mental health issues were mitigating factors for both the Kanahooka and the Mandalong offences (ROS26). Although no causal connection had been demonstrated between the Applicant's mental health issues and the offences, his Honour took into account the Applicant's depression associated with his failed property development, and the impact of these issues upon his capacity to make clear, informed decisions to become involved in criminal activity (ROS26).

75His Honour accepted that the Applicant was remorseful (ROS24, 26).

76The sentencing Judge found, as a mitigating factor, that there was no substantial harm caused because all the drugs were seized (ROS29).

77With respect to the Mandalong offences, the sentencing Judge characterised the s.24(1) offence as being ""in the mid range or perhaps a little below the mid range"" and the s.24A(1) offence as being ""at least in the mid range"" (ROS27).

78Addressing the Kanahooka offence, the sentencing Judge observed that ""the standard non-parole period does not strictly apply because of the plea of guilty"" (ROS28). His Honour expressed the view that the Applicant's ""involvement is in the mid range or slightly higher for that offence"" (ROS28). 

79A number of objective and subjective factors were mentioned. The sentencing Judge then stated, in a paragraph emphasised by the Applicant at the hearing of this application (ROS29):

""The court notes that the standard non-parole period while not strictly applicable because of the plea of guilty and the impact of the mitigating matters that I have just mentioned which fall within s 21A is nevertheless a guidepost for this court, and that the Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that while this court exercises a sentencing discretion, there must be some relativity between the standard non-parole period and the non-parole period fixed. In this case specifically the s 23 and 22 matters impact significantly upon the standard non-parole period, and the special circumstances because of the cumulation will also impact on the length of the non-parole period for this particular offence as it is the offence which will bring with it the longest sentence, and will effectively be the sentence which determines the period on which he is on parole.""

80His Honour said, in a further passage relied upon by the Applicant in this Court (ROS31):

""In relation to count 1 on the Kanahooka matter, manufacture not less than a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug, and taking into account the matter on the Form 1 which in itself is a reasonably serious matter, the court convicts you and imposes a non-parole period of six years to date from 31 March 2010 and to expire on 30 March 2016. The court imposes an additional term of four years to date from 31 March 2016 and expires on 30 March 2020; that is a total of ten years from 31 March 2010 until 30 March 2020, again the starting point was double; namely, twenty years. In essence the court points out in relation to that matter that twenty years would have carried with it a statutory non-parole period of fifteen years, which is in fact the standard non-parole period, and the matter is to be deducted from that given the court's conclusion that the offending here was in the midrange or a little higher, the mitigating factors set out under 21A and more particularly the s 22 and s 23 factors.""

81His Honour accepted that there were prospects of rehabilitation, but that he could not assess the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, and not reoffending, as being good (ROS26).

82Special circumstances were found because the sentences were to be partly cumulative and because of the mental health issues referred to by Dr Allnutt (ROS29).

83On the issue of parity, the sentencing Judge noted that no other person had been charged with the Mandalong offences. XY had pleaded guilty to the Kanahooka offence, but had not at that time been sentenced. His Honour said (ROS19):

""Parity therefore is not strictly applicable in the Kanahooka matters in terms of this sentencing exercise, although this court will nominate the level of criminality, that is the level of involvement of this offender so that any subsequent court when considering the sentence imposed will have a clear understanding of the role played by this offender and can then make the appropriate determination as to the relatively [sic] between this offender and any subsequently sentenced co-offender.""

Has Muldrock Error Been Demonstrated in this Case?

84Only the Kanahooka offence carries a standard non-parole period. The Muldrock ground is directed to the sentence for that offence only.

85In extensive remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge addressed the objective circumstances of the offences, the Applicant's subjective circumstances and had regard to principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality before passing the sentences, one of which is presently under challenge. In light of the Applicant's early pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities, a total 50% discount was applied on sentence.

86The sentencing Judge referred (at [79] above) to the standard non-parole period as a ""guidepost"" on sentence for the Kanahooka offence and observed that, whilst the Court exercises a sentencing discretion, ""there must be some relativity between the standard non-parole period and the non-parole period fixed"". His Honour observed further that the Applicant's pleas of guilty, assistance and a finding of special circumstances flowing from accumulation would also impact upon the length of the non-parole period (ROS29). 

87In my view, these statements do not disclose Muldrock error. The use of the standard non-parole period as a guidepost on sentence accords with Muldrock. An observation that there must be ""some relativity"" between the standard non-parole period and the non-parole period fixed is not a heretical statement in light of Muldrock. The standard non-parole period remains a significant guidepost on sentence.

88The sentencing Judge returned again (at [80] above) to the standard non-parole period. By that time, his Honour had identified and passed sentence for the Kanahooka offence. What is said at that point concerning the standard non-parole period is superfluous. In any event, I do not accept that what is said there constituted either a prohibited two-step approach or an overly prescriptive use of the standard non-parole period.

89It is necessary to keep in mind, as well, that the challenge on this application relates to only one of three offences for which the Applicant was sentenced at the same time. This Court has observed that a narrow focus on one of several sentences imposed at the same time tends to introduce an element of artificiality into the appeal process: R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [82]. That is the position in this case.

90The Kanahooka offence involved a quantity of 52.6 kilograms of admixture, containing at least 4,805 grams of MDP2P, the large commercial quantity of which was 500 grams. The quantity involved far exceeded the large commercial quantity. A sophisticated and sustained drug manufacturing process was involved in the Kanahooka offence, with the Applicant playing a pivotal role.

91Whilst committing this offence in early 2008, the Applicant was on bail for the Mandalong offences. The earlier offences had also involved a substantial drug manufacturing enterprise, with the Applicant playing a major role in the selection and establishment of the property for illegal purposes, and in the manufacturing process itself. The possession by the Applicant of three pistols, one with a silencer attached, together with tablet presses meant that the paraphernalia of a substantial drug supply enterprise were present in this case: R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43; 205 A Crim R 222 at 234 [76].

92His Honour's finding, as a mitigating factor, that no substantial harm was caused because all the drugs were seized, was very generous to the Applicant. If the drugs had been disseminated into the community, it would have constituted a significant aggravating factor on sentence. However, the absence of an aggravating factor does not translate the matter into a mitigating factor. This Court has observed repeatedly, in the context of offences where police operations mean that the drugs are not actually disseminated into the community, that the moral culpability of an offender is not thereby reduced (see the cases gathered in R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186; 216 A Crim R 152 at 166-168 [88]-[100]). This was a very large quantity of the relevant prohibited drug with the potential to cause a great deal of harm both individually and socially: R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40; 221 A Crim R 505 at 524 [73].

93The Kanahooka offence was not an isolated offence committed by the Applicant. To the contrary, he persisted in drug manufacture (on an even larger scale) despite his arrest for the Mandalong offences and his serious injuries sustained in that process.

94The Applicant's reliance on sentencing statistics and other sentencing decisions provides no real assistance to him, in particular in the unusual and aggravated circumstances applicable to the Kanahooka offence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 42; 242 CLR 520 at 537 [54]; Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 at [45]-[46].

95Even if error had been demonstrated concerning the Kanahooka offence, the totality principle would have required attention being given to the sentences to be passed for the Applicant's total criminality. This would not have assisted the Applicant in this case. 

96There is no merit in the complaint of Muldrock error with respect to the Kanahooka offence. However, even if there were, I am not satisfied that any lesser sentence would be warranted under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

The Parity Ground

97Ground 2 complains of disparity of sentence when compared with that passed by the same sentencing Judge with respect to the co-offender, XY, on 14 March 2011. XY was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years and three months, with a balance of term of four years for the Kanahooka offence (with an offence of possession of a precursor on a Form 1).

98The evidence discloses no explanation at all for the Applicant's delay in advancing this ground of appeal. 

99Where the same Judge sentences two related offenders and gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences, having regard to the differing criminality of each, the differing subjective circumstances and relevant sentencing principles, this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance because of different sentencing outcomes: Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191 at 209-210 [77]-[83]. 

100In sentencing XY, his Honour had regard to his earlier remarks on sentence concerning the Applicant. XY was being sentenced for a single offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of MDP2P (the Kanahooka offence), with a similar Form 1 offence as the Applicant for this offence.

101XY received a 25% discount for his plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities (XY, ROS8).

102The sentencing Judge concluded that the respective roles of the Applicant and XY were such that they were ""on a par in terms of their level of criminality"" (XY, ROS6).

103His Honour pointed to differences between the position of the two offenders. These included the fact that the Applicant committed the Kanahooka offence whilst at liberty on bail for the Mandalong offences, and the fact that disregard for the safety of the public was significantly enhanced in the case of the Applicant in his commission of the Kanahooka offence, following the demonstrated explosive dangers surrounding the Mandalong offences (XY, ROS7).

104Further, his Honour found that XY had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend (ROS11). 

105XY was 35 years' old at the time of sentence and had no significant record of convictions, so that he was treated as having good character, which could be called in aid (XY, ROS12).

106His Honour was conscious of the need for ""some relativity"" between the sentences imposed on the Applicant and XY for the Kanahooka offence, whilst acknowledging differences between the two offenders in a number of respects. 

107The fact that the Applicant committed the Kanahooka offence whilst on bail for the Mandalong offences was, on its own, a very significant aggravating factor which applied to the Applicant, but not XY.

108The sentencing Judge explained the differences between the Applicant and XY which contributed to the sentences actually imposed in each case.

109The Applicant has failed to demonstrate a legitimate sense of grievance, viewed objectively, arising from the sentence imposed upon XY for the Kanahooka offence.

Conclusion

110The application for extension of time was filed long after sentence had been imposed upon the Applicant in the District Court. The explanation for the delay arises from the Applicant's desire to take advantage of the decision in Muldrock. No explanation at all has been advanced for the delay in advancing the parity ground.

111The grounds of appeal lack merit. No error has been demonstrated. Even if it had been, taking into account the further evidence adduced in this Court concerning the Applicant's custodial progress, no lesser sentence is warranted under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In these circumstances, an extension of time should not be granted.

112The application for extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.

113BELLEW J: I agree with Johnson J.

2762733,Duncombe v R [2013] NSWCCA 271,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and join in his Honour's recommendation that the Applicant be provided with an opportunity to undertake a program with respect to anger management and violent offending while in custody. This should occur as soon as possible.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Sean Andrew Duncombe, seeks an extension of time to appeal with respect to a sentence imposed in the District Court on 15 December 2010. 

The Offence and Sentence

3The Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s.33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by 25 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years. 

4The Applicant asked the sentencing Judge to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of affray which, when prosecuted separately, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.

5Taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years commencing on 3 May 2010 and expiring on 2 May 2015, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 3 May 2015 and expiring on 2 May 2018. 

The Present Application

6The evidence on this application reveals that the Applicant informed his solicitor at the time of sentence in December 2010 that he wished to appeal, but that legal advice provided to the Applicant was that a sentence appeal would not be successful. No appeal was brought by the Applicant to this Court. 

7In April 2013, the Applicant heard that Legal Aid NSW was reviewing sentences in light of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""). 

8Thereafter, on 28 June 2013, Notice of Application for an Extension of Time to Seek Leave to Appeal was filed in this Court.

9Accordingly, the application was brought two years and six months after sentence was imposed in the District Court. The ground of appeal sought to be advanced asserts Muldrock error - that the sentencing Judge erred in the way in which the applicable standard non-parole period was taken into account on sentence. The concept of Muldrock error was considered in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19]-[28].

10In Abdul v R at [42]-[53], the Court considered the principles to be applied where an extension of time is sought to appeal in a case such as this. This approach will be followed in determining the present application.

Facts of the Offence

11The sentencing Judge drew on an Agreed Statement of Facts for the purpose of finding facts on sentence.

12On the afternoon of Sunday 13 September 2009, the Applicant (then aged 21) was present in the family home at Brushgrove (near Grafton), also occupied by the Applicant's mother, sister and brother. 

13At about 4.00 pm, the victim, Trevor Cooke (hereafter ""the victim"" or ""Mr Cooke"") (then aged 49), was sitting on the rear veranda of his neighbouring premises. The victim and a friend, Michael Cairns, heard a loud commotion coming from the Applicant's house. Mr Cairns went to investigate the noise which sounded like a domestic argument. He observed a man holding a female by the neck with both hands over the veranda railing of the Applicant's home. The female was believed to be the Applicant's sister, although the identity of the male was unknown (it was not the Applicant).

14Mr Cairns continued walking towards the Applicant's property, accompanied by a 16-year old girl who had been on the street. As Mr Cairns approached the boundary fence, the Applicant, numerous members of the Applicant's family and unknown others at the premises took exception at Mr Cairns' concern and commenced a verbal tirade in his direction, along with threats of violence. 

15About this time, the victim walked out on the roadway holding a wooden children's baseball bat which he leaned on near the boundary alignment of his property. The Applicant commenced to goad the victim to fight, accompanied by a tirade of verbal abuse, to which the victim did not respond. The 16-year old girl was also subjected to verbal abuse and offers of violence from the Applicant, to which she responded in kind.

16About this time, the Applicant armed himself with a builder's level. He was waving this about in a threatening manner on the roadway in front of the victim and his friends, making verbal threats towards them. 

17The Applicant then produced a sledgehammer and a 180-centimetre long steel crowbar, which he used to threaten and intimidate those who were present. The Applicant did this by slamming the sledgehammer into the roadway and using the crowbar as a spear, throwing it into the roadway a short distance in front of the victims.

18The victim and those with him stood on the roadway in front of their property, whilst the Applicant was behaving in this aggressive manner. This behaviour constituted the offence of affray taken into account on a Form 1. 

19At this point, the Applicant's father, Donald Duncombe, approached the victims and directed abuse at them, challenging Mr Cooke to fight and use the baseball bat, whilst shoving and pushing the victim. Several other males and females from the Applicant's family and friends joined in the abuse and threats towards the victims. The women from the Applicant's premises were directing their abuse and threats towards the 16-year old girl, whilst the males were directing threats and abuse towards Mr Cooke and Mr Cairns.

20The incident continued for a number of minutes, and reached a point where Donald Duncombe ripped the shirt from Mr Cooke. Donald Duncombe then attacked Mr Cooke, swinging punches at him and the two men fell to the roadway. 

21The Applicant and his brother rushed towards the victim. 

22During the wrestle, Mr Cooke got on top of Donald Duncombe and was holding him to the ground. The Applicant raised the sledgehammer above his head and struck Mr Cooke a forceful blow to the back whilst he was on the ground. The victim screamed in pain and rolled away from Donald Duncombe. The victim lay helpless on the ground. 

23At this point, the Applicant again swung the sledgehammer at Mr Cooke and this time it glanced off the right side of the head and face of the victim. 

24The Applicant raised the sledgehammer above his head in an attempt to inflict a third blow to Mr Cooke, who was still lying helpless on the ground. However, a witness from a neighbouring home intervened and grabbed hold of the handle of the sledgehammer and prevented this blow.

25The Applicant and others then returned to the Duncombe house, leaving the scene.

26Mr Cooke was admitted to Grafton Base Hospital and was found to have multiple bruises and contusions to his back and abrasions to both knees. Further examination revealed that he had fractures of the spinus processes of T5 and the lateral processes of T6, T7 and T8, and a left-side rib fracture. The victim remained in hospital for nine days, until 22 September 2009, with a chest tube in place for several days because of a continued leakage of air from his lung. The chest tube was removed on 21 September 2009. 

27At the time of the commission of the offence on 13 September 2009, the Applicant was subject to a suspended sentence of nine months' imprisonment for destroying or damaging property, and a sentence of nine months' periodic detention following call-up for break, enter and steal (both sentences imposed in the Grafton Local Court on 20 April 2009).

28The Applicant fled after the offence and was arrested in the Northern Territory on 16 January 2010. He was returned to New South Wales. 

29Following revocation of the Applicant's parole by the State Parole Authority, the Applicant served a sentence comprising a non-parole period of three months and 17 days commencing on 19 January 2010 and expiring on 5 May 2010, with a balance of term expiring on 6 August 2010.

30As noted, the sentencing Judge directed that the sentence under challenge date from 3 May 2010. 

Has Muldrock Error Been Demonstrated?

31The Applicant contends that Muldrock error is demonstrated in this case because:

(a)the sentencing Judge adopted a two-stage approach to sentencing;

(b)the non-parole period was accorded determinative significance in the sentencing process.

32The Crown contends that no Muldrock error has been demonstrated.

33Detailed written submissions were filed for the Applicant and counsel supplemented these with oral submissions at the hearing of the application. It is not necessary to recount those submissions for the purpose of determining the present application. 

34It is necessary to consider the remarks on sentence as a whole, and to read them fairly, for the purpose of determining whether error has been demonstrated.

35Following a recital of the facts, his Honour stated (ROS4):

""The offence under s 33 carries the potential for a maximum term of imprisonment of twenty five years and it is subject to a standard non-parole period of seven years. In those circumstances it is necessary to identify the objective criminality of the offender on this occasion and to gauge it against the mid range of objective seriousness for offences under this section.""

36Thereafter, his Honour adverted to a number of features of the offence, including the use of a weapon which was capable of inflicting catastrophic harm to the victim, the fact that the attack was perpetrated upon a man who was already in a vulnerable position (lying on the ground), the nature of the blows struck and the fact that the third blow was prevented by intervention of a third party, and not as a result of the Applicant desisting from the attack. 

37His Honour characterised the injuries to the victim as being ""clearly in excess of the minimum required to meet the criterion of really serious physical harm"". 

38Reference was made to the Applicant's mental condition, as revealed in a psychological report dated 28 May 2010 of Dr Stuart Mann. His Honour noted that the Applicant suffered from a mental condition with a number of components, including dependence on psychoactive substances and a dependence on alcohol. His Honour referred expressly to the Applicant's cognitive disorder arising from a physical attack upon him when aged about 13 years. As his Honour observed, the Applicant had been assessed as being of below-average intelligence, and his capacity for self-control and rational evaluation were compromised. The sentencing Judge accepted that there was ""a causal connection between the prisoner's mental condition and his commission of this crime"" and that ""this condition lowers the objective criminality of his acts"" (ROS5). 

39In a passage which the Applicant contends reveals error, his Honour said (ROS5-6):

""Taking all of these matters into consideration I would fix the objective criminality of this offence as being slightly below the mid range for offences of this nature. The prisoner's counsel Mr Priestley submitted that as against the standard non-parole period of seven years such an analysis as that which I have disclosed might be quantified at six years. I agree that represents a fair appraisal of the culpability of this offender. I stress however that this is to be viewed not simply against the standard non-parole period but against the overall maximum penalty of twenty five years. I have not been distracted from consideration of that penalty by over concentration on the standard non-parole period.""

40Reference was then made to a submission by the Applicant's counsel in the District Court that his subjective case ""might reduce the appropriate sentence to a substantial extent"". Reference was made to the Applicant's youth and family support, together with other aspects of the psychological report. 

41His Honour had regard to the Applicant's late plea of guilty which attracted a discount of not more than 10%. The sentencing Judge noted that no expression of remorse or contrition had been directed to the Court by the Applicant, although such an expression was contained in the psychological report.

42His Honour referred to the Applicant's criminal history, which provided no assistance to the Applicant. His Honour pointed to a period of abstinence whilst the Applicant was in the Northern Territory, after departing this State in breach of his obligation to attend periodic detention after 13 September 2009. 

43In all the circumstances, the sentencing Judge assessed the Applicant's ""prospects of rehabilitation as fair"". Reference was made, in this respect, to the Applicant's youth and his below-average intellectual capacity. As a result of that disadvantage, his Honour considered that the Applicant was ""not a completely suitable medium for the exhibition of the full force of general deterrence"" although personal deterrence did ""loom somewhat more importantly"". Regard was had to the fact that the offence was committed whilst the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty. 

44His Honour had regard to the revocation of the Applicant's parole in determining the commencement date of the present sentence. A finding of special circumstances was made, to take account of the Applicant's ""clear need for parole and supervision on release and taking into account also his youth and prospects of rehabilitation"" (ROS8).

45I am satisfied that his Honour utilised a two-stage approach to sentence in this case. His Honour identified a non-parole period following an examination of the objective circumstances, before turning to other factors which bore upon the fixing of the sentence to be passed. Of course, this is unsurprising given the recognised approach to sentencing for standard non-parole period offences before the decision in Muldrock.

46An error of this type may be regarded as a process error, unless the second form of Muldrock error (at [31](b) above) is also established. This is because it is necessary for the Applicant to establish material error in accordance with the principles in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284. In cases where the standard non-parole period has been accorded determinative significance in the sentencing exercise, then material error may be demonstrated readily. Of course, it then becomes a matter for this Court, acting in accordance with the principles in Baxter v R, to determine whether some other sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

47I am not satisfied that the second form of Muldrock error has been demonstrated in this case. The sentencing Judge did not accord determinative significance to the standard non-parole period. 

48As an examination of the remarks on sentence makes clear, his Honour was very much alive to the two statutory guideposts, the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period. 

49In the case of offences under s.33 Crimes Act 1900, this Court has noted the wide gap between these two guideposts: R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [36]-[38]; Anderson v R [2008] NSWCCA 211 at [17]; R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [19]; Sproates v R [2009] NSWCCA 29 at [43]. 

50In the context of the offence of possess pistol contrary to s.7 Firearms Act 1996, it has been said that a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of three years constitute ""two irreconcilable standards"": R v Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32 at [38]; Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [84]-[85].

51A similar comment was made concerning a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of four years, for car rebirthing contrary to s.154G Crimes Act 1900, where it was said that it was ""difficult to reconcile"" these two periods: R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189 at [54]-[56].

52A similar observation may be made concerning the respective periods of 25 and seven years for a s.33(1)(b) offence such as in this case. Concentration upon the standard non-parole period may serve to distract from the maximum sentence, in a manner which may operate in an unduly favourable fashion to an offender. The sentencing Judge in this case was alive to this consideration (see [39] above).

53Despite that wide gap, it is, of course, necessary for a sentencing court to have regard, and give appropriate weight, to both periods. Undue focus on the standard non-parole period may serve to distract from the proper role of the maximum penalty on sentence. 

Should This Court Grant an Extension of Time to Appeal?

54I am far from satisfied that any lesser sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) of the Act. 

55In AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Garling J, I stated at [67]-[68]:

""67 The maximum sentence of 25 years' imprisonment indicates the seriousness with which an offence under s.33 is regarded: R v Zhang at [28]. As Howie J observed in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [11], the offence carries the highest maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature short of life imprisonment.

68 The seriousness of s.33 offences is emphasised, as well, by the intention required to commit an offence under the section. Intention to cause grievous bodily harm is the mental element for murder, in the event that the victim died: R v Zoef [2005] NSWCCA 268 at [113]; R v Mitchell at 101 [27]. It is this mental element that makes an individual offender liable to a maximum penalty of 25 years, as opposed to 10 years for a s.35(2) offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm: R v Mitchell at 101 [27].""

56A breadth of conduct and consequences is comprehended by s.33 Crimes Act 1900. The extent of injuries sustained by a victim of a s.33 offence is of great significance in assessing the objective gravity of the offence. However, the objective gravity of a s.33 offence is not determined by consideration of the injuries caused, with all the circumstances of the offence being relevant: AM v R at [69]-[72].

57Of particular application to the circumstances of this case, are the following observations in AM v R at [73]:

""The absence of planning and premeditation is relevant to objective gravity, although this feature may be diminished (as a factor favouring the offender) given the requisite intention for a s.33 offence: R v Zamagias at [14]. This is expressly so where the attack is sustained and there are opportunities for the offender to desist from the attack but he does not do so: R v Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 161 at [17]. Likewise, where the offender does not voluntarily end the attack, but it is necessary for another person to pull him away to protect the victim: R v Zamagias at [13]; R v Mitchell at 101 [28].""

58The attack by the Applicant upon Mr Cooke with a sledgehammer involved the use of force against a vulnerable victim, which aggravates the crime. The victim was lying helpless on the ground at the time when the Applicant struck the second blow with the sledgehammer: AM v R at [78]. A third blow aimed at the prone victim was stopped as a result of intervention by a third party, and not because the Applicant voluntarily ended the attack: AM v R at [73]. That this intervention was most fortunate for both the victim and the Applicant is clear, given the potential consequences of a direct blow to the head by use of a sledgehammer. 

59The Applicant had a prior offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (in August 2007) as well as other offences on his record. The present offence was committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty in the form of a suspended sentence and a sentence of imprisonment by way of periodic detention. After this offence, the Applicant absconded to the Northern Territory.

60The sentencing Judge gave appropriate weight to the Applicant's limited intellectual capacity. This factor operated both for and against the Applicant on sentence, given his capacity for aggressive conduct which bears upon issues of personal deterrence and protection of the community.

61I am entirely unpersuaded that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant is one which calls for the intervention of this Court. The Applicant involved himself in a sustained violent episode, culminating in the use by him of a sledgehammer with grave consequences. The objective gravity of the offence, and the Applicant's subjective circumstances, were taken into account together with other relevant sentencing principles applicable to the case. A finding of special circumstances was made to allow the Applicant an appropriate period of supervision upon his return to the community.

62In circumstances where the application is without merit, an extension of time to bring the application ought be refused.

63A final observation should be made concerning the application. The evidence before this Court indicates that, despite his own requests, the Applicant has not received counselling and assistance whilst in custody with respect to anger management and related issues. 

64Given the nature of the offence and the Applicant's history, it is more than highly desirable that the Applicant be provided with an opportunity to undertake an appropriate custodial program of this type before the expiration of his non-parole period on 2 May 2015. Not only will involvement in such a program assist the Applicant, but the public interest will be served to promote protection of the community when the Applicant becomes eligible for release on parole. 

65I propose that the application to extend time to seek leave to appeal be refused. This Court should recommend that the Applicant be provided with a timely opportunity to undertake a custodial program with respect to anger management and violent offending.

66BELLEW J: I agree with Johnson J.

2762734,Efthimiadis v R [2013] NSWCCA 276,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the order which he proposes.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Theodore Efthimiadis, applies for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence imposed on 17 February 2010 at the Gosford District Court following his conviction by a jury on a charge of solicit to murder contrary to s.26 Crimes Act 1900. 

3The maximum penalty for solicit to murder is imprisonment for 25 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years set by statute. 

4On 17 February 2010, following his conviction by a jury at trial, the Applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge O'Connor QC to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 17 December 2007 and expiring on 16 December 2017, with a balance of term of three years and four months commencing on 17 December 2017 and expiring on 16 April 2021. 

The Present Application

5On 26 February 2010, the Applicant lodged a Notice of Intention to Appeal against conviction and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Applicant applied for legal aid for the purpose of an appeal and was informed subsequently that legal aid had been refused. The Applicant did not proceed with an appeal and the Notice of Intention to Appeal lapsed.

6On 5 October 2011, the High Court of Australia gave judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""). Thereafter, the Applicant's case was reviewed, with a number of others, within Legal Aid NSW.

7On 28 June 2013, a Notice of Application for Extension of Time to file a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal against sentence was filed in this Court. 

8The sole ground of appeal relied upon by the Applicant is in the following terms:

""His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] 244 CLR 120.""

9The concept of ""Muldrock error"" was considered in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19]-[28] and what is said there should be read in conjunction with the present judgment.

10The principles to be applied on an application for an extension of time such as this were considered by the Court in Abdul v R at [42]-[53]. Those principles will be applied in determining the present application for extension of time.

Muldrock Error is Conceded

11The Crown concedes that the sentencing Judge approached the sentencing of the Applicant upon a basis which did not comply with the decision in Muldrock. This concession was appropriately made. In accordance with the law as it stood, his Honour was satisfied that the matter fell within the mid-range of offences of this type. After considering a range of other matters relevant to sentence, his Honour returned to the standard non-parole period and said (ROS18-19):

""The standard non-parole period is intended for a middle range case where the offender has been convicted after trial, R v Way. The court is required to impose the standard non-parole period unless it determines there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard period, Section 44B(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

The reasons for the setting of a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are those referred to in Section 21A. I am of the opinion that a standard non-parole period is applicable in this case. The reason for so finding is that I am of the opinion that the offence is in the mid range of objective seriousness for the reasons referred to.

Secondly, apart from lack of evidence of substantial harm to the intended victim there are no other mitigating factors of relevance in Section 21A. Indeed as mentioned there are a number of aggravating factors.

Finally as mentioned I do not regard the case as warranting a finding of special circumstances so as to affect the applicability of the standard non-parole period.""

12His Honour expressed the opinion that the appropriate sentence was one of 13 years and four months' imprisonment with the standard non-parole period of 10 years to be imposed (ROS20).

13The Crown submitted that, in the circumstances of the case, the Court would conclude that no lesser sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, so that the Court should refuse the Applicant an extension of time. 

14Given the Crown concession of Muldrock error, it is appropriate for the Court to consider the merits of the application itself, including the Applicant's prospects of securing a lesser sentence, for the purpose of determining whether the discretion to extend time ought be exercised in this case. 

The Applicant's Offence

15The sentencing Judge made findings of fact based upon evidence adduced at the trial. Those findings are not challenged in this Court. 

16At the time of the offence in December 2006, the Applicant was 42 years of age. Three years earlier, the Applicant had met and commenced a relationship with the victim, a young woman then aged 16 years.

17Prior to his relationship with the victim, the Applicant had two relationships with women. From the first of those relationships, the Applicant had two children and there was one child of the second relationship. The mothers of those children retained custody, and all reside in the United Kingdom.

18In 2004, a son was born to the relationship between the Applicant and the victim. The child was two years of age at the time of the offence.

19The Applicant had a criminal record and, at the time of the offence, he had a serious addiction to illicit drugs and also abused prescribed medication. These factors impacted upon his relationship with the victim.

20The Applicant was on parole and had been convicted for a further offence, leading to the initiation of action for breach of parole. The Applicant absconded to Queensland to avoid apprehension, taking with him the victim and their son. 

21The relationship between the Applicant and the victim deteriorated as a consequence of his continued abuse of drugs. As a consequence, the victim left the Applicant and returned to live with her uncle on the Central Coast in New South Wales. This resulted in further tension, the Applicant being reluctant to return to New South Wales for fear of apprehension by way of the outstanding warrant. 

22The Applicant did return to New South Wales on 10 December 2006. Whilst he was waiting for a train at Central Railway Station, the Applicant coincidentally ran into a person whom he had known for some 20 years, having met him in prison. This person ultimately became a police informer and was referred to at trial and on sentence as Mr X. During the course of the Applicant's conversation with Mr X at the railway station, the Applicant disclosed the difficulties he was having with his relationship, and that his partner had left him taking their son. 

23Mr X was not called as a witness at the trial, with medical evidence being produced certifying as to his unavailability.

24It was the Applicant's case at trial (at which he gave evidence), that Mr X had suggested that the victim be killed as a way to overcome the Applicant's domestic problems, and that he (Mr X) was in a position to provide the name of someone who could do it. The two men exchanged telephone numbers. 

25The sentencing Judge observed in the remarks on sentence that the jury had clearly rejected the Applicant's evidence, insofar as he asserted that it was Mr X who had raised the prospect of killing the victim, with duress allegedly then being applied by Mr X to the Applicant. The sentencing Judge observed that this scenario was impossible to reconcile with the recorded telephone conversations between the Applicant and the hit man (an undercover police officer). 

26It is clear that the Applicant and Mr X had discussed a plan to murder the victim because, on 11 December 2006, Mr X contacted the police informing them that the Applicant was seeking the services of a person to murder the victim. Thereafter, a controlled operation was put in place and an undercover police officer made telephone contact with the Applicant. The undercover police officer was referred to in the trial and on sentence as ""B"". 

27Warrants were obtained to intercept telephone conversations. Telephone conversations were recorded between 13 and 23 December 2006. The conversations in the main were between the Applicant, the victim and ""B"". The sentencing Judge observed that the telephone conversations between the Applicant and the victim occupied many hours. At trial, the Applicant relied on these conversations as disclosing ongoing love and affection for the victim and not any disposition to murder her. The Applicant asserted in evidence that at no time did he intend to have the victim murdered. 

28The sentencing Judge noted that none of the intercepted telephone conversations included a conversation with Mr X, although observing that the intercepted conversations were all on mobile phones and not by landline. However, there was no evidence at all to corroborate the Applicant's claim that some measure of duress was applied to him by Mr X. It might be thought, in any event, that such a claim lacked plausibility given that it was the Applicant who had a motive to have the victim murdered, with no plausible explanation existing as to why Mr X would seek to pressure the Applicant into taking this course.

29The sentencing Judge noted that multiple telephone conversations between the Applicant and the victim were recorded in the period 13 to 23 December 2006. In those conversations, the Applicant sounded emotional and was often crying, ""explaining in a number of those conversations that he was suffering from withdrawal and taking Subutex"". The Applicant wanted the victim to return to Queensland, but she refused to do so.

30A number of conversations were recorded between the Applicant and ""B"". In a conversation on 14 December 2006, the Applicant told ""B"" that he was ""keen to get the car fixed"", the Applicant agreeing at trial that this was a reference to having the victim murdered.

31On 15 December 2006, the Applicant told ""B"" that he was ""100% keen"" for the arrangements to be carried out. Subsequent conversations between the Applicant and ""B"" concerned arrangements for the Applicant to meet ""B"" in New South Wales.

32On 23 December 2006, the Applicant travelled from Queensland, meeting ""B"" at Wyong Station. The Applicant got into ""B's"" motor vehicle and asked him to drive to Wyee Station. The conversation in the motor vehicle was recorded by means of an in-car video. In the course of the journey, the Applicant discussed a number of scenarios, the intention being for the Applicant to get custody of his son to the exclusion of the victim. 

33The initial conversation was to the effect that the Applicant wanted ""B"" to arrange an accident, resulting in the victim being disabled to the extent of being put in a wheelchair, such that she would no longer be able to care for their son. The Applicant told ""B"" that his intention was to take his son to England. Money was discussed. The Applicant said that he expected to pay between $10,000.00 and $15,000.00, and he would raise this money by doing an armed robbery (as it happens, the Applicant's criminal history included an offence of armed robbery for which he had been in prison). 

34When discussing the matter with ""B"", the Applicant told him he had been thinking of ""so many ways"" to do it. He told ""B"" that he wanted it done ""probably in three weeks"" and that he would give ""B"" a call and say words to the effect, ""Ready to go"". 

35The following conversation on 23 December 2006 was recorded, and assumed considerable significance at the trial:

""B - 'But all you said is like all you've said to me is that you want her - you want her disabled. You don't want her to walk but ...'

Applicant - 'I'd rather - it's difficult you know, I'd rather if she was gone. It would be better for me if she was gone you know. Because I - I don't think we're going to last anyway, the way things are going. Yeah, and I'll be - it'll be possible for me to get the kid and you know what I mean'.""

36A little later in the conversation, the following was said:

""B - 'So you want her put in a cemetery or you want her put in hospital?'

Applicant - 'A cemetery'.""

37The Applicant provided ""B"" with a photograph of the victim and directions, including the address where she was residing, and a description of her motor vehicle and its registration number.

38The sentencing Judge observed that there was nothing in the recorded conversations between the Applicant and ""B"" in which the Applicant expressed any hesitation about his intention, or any reluctance to meet with ""B"". His Honour observed, as well, although the Applicant sounded to be in an emotional state during telephone conversations with the victim on 20 December 2006, when he spoke to ""B"" the same day, he sounded composed. The in-car video utilised on 23 December 2006 indicated that the Applicant was ""calm and relaxed bearing in mind that he believed he was dealing with a professional killer"".

39The sentencing Judge observed that the Applicant was sufficiently prepared to provide himself with an alibi for the murder, by telling ""B"" he wanted the deed done when the Applicant was in Queensland, reporting to police in compliance with his bail conditions.

40The sentencing Judge held that the offence was explained by the Applicant's desire to have the victim out of the way, to enable him to have custody of their son. 

41The Applicant was arrested and charged on 23 December 2006 with bail being refused. At the time of his arrest, the Applicant was in breach of parole for an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit felony in company. 

42From 24 December 2006 to 7 October 2007, the Applicant was serving the balance of parole for that offence, being a period of nine months and 14 days.

43Between 18 July 2007 and 17 December 2007, the Applicant served a five-month sentence of imprisonment for four counts of goods in custody. 

44The Applicant has been in custody solely for the offence of solicit to murder since 17 December 2007, and the sentence imposed for that offence commenced on that day. 

The Applicant's Criminal History and Subjective Circumstances

45The Applicant was 42 years' old at the time of the offence and 45 years' old at the time of sentence. He is now 49 years' old.

46According to a presentence report before the District Court, the Applicant was born and raised in Australia to Greek parents, and was the middle of three children. The Applicant left school before the completion of Year 9. He had a chequered employment history. 

47The Applicant has a criminal history dating from 1980. There are a number of offences of violence, including assault and armed robbery. In addition, there are offences of dishonesty and drug offences. 

48The presentence report noted that the Applicant had not successfully completed any of the five parole orders which had been imposed upon him, and he had relapsed repeatedly to drug use and had reoffended, as well as moving interstate without permission.

49The presentence report noted that the Applicant had been in custody for almost 12 of the past 20 years (as at November 2009). 

50The author of the presentence report had spoken to the victim who had commenced a new relationship, with a child being born of that union. However, as the sentencing Judge noted, despite the nature of the offence, the victim told the author of the presentence report that she remained supportive of the Applicant, and would consider slowly reconnecting with him upon his return to the community.

51Whatever may be the wisdom of this approach, it would appear that the victim was prepared to maintain some contact with the Applicant, presumably because of their common interest in their son.

Should the Court Grant an Extension of Time in this Case?

Submissions

52It was submitted for the Applicant that a lesser sentence was warranted in law having regard to applicable sentencing principles, the objective seriousness of the offence and the Applicant's subjective circumstances, taking into account the additional evidence before the Court concerning the Applicant's custodial history and experiences. 

53It was submitted that it was a mitigating circumstance that there was no substantial harm done to the victim, who remained supportive. It was further submitted for the Applicant that the sentence served for breach of parole, and for the goods in custody offences, should be taken into account as well in considering totality in the issue of special circumstances. 

54Reference was made to several sentencing decisions for solicit to murder, together with sentencing statistics, which were said to support imposition of a shorter sentence. 

55The Crown submitted that the gravity of the offence, the Applicant's minimal subjective case and application of relevant sentencing principles would see the Court determining that no lesser sentence was warranted, so that an extension of time ought be refused. 

56The Crown submitted that the commencement date of 17 December 2007 was and remains appropriate in this case.

Decision

57If the present application had been brought in time then, once error had been demonstrated, it would be necessary for the Court to consider whether the error was material and, if it was, whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in accordance with the principles in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284. 

58The Court re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles, with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which s.6(3) provides by reference to evidence placed before this Court on appeal: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at 176-178 [119]-[124]; Baxter v R at 287 [17]-[19]. 

59Additional evidence has been placed before the Court in the form of affidavits of the Applicant himself concerning his progress in custody, his health and other aspects of his family life which have transpired since sentence was passed. It is appropriate that the Court have regard to this material.

60The sentencing Judge's assessment that this was a mid-range offence of solicit to murder was not challenged before this Court. 

61This was a crime of considerable objective gravity. The Applicant (then aged 42) intended to have murdered his partner (then aged 19). His motive was to obtain custody of their two-year old son. The electronic surveillance evidence adduced at trial made clear that the Applicant had considered the appropriate adverse action to take against the victim over a number of days in December 2006. He showed no sign of stepping back from his intention to harm the victim. 

62In the end, the Applicant made entirely clear, in his conversation with the person whom he believed was a professional killer, that he wished the young woman to be in a ""cemetery"" and not a ""hospital"". This was a chilling offence, motivated by self-interest, by which the Applicant intended the murder of this very young woman, who had done no harm to the Applicant. All she had done was refuse to return to Queensland to live with the Applicant, her fugitive partner. 

63The fact that the offence was committed in the context of a family dispute does not render it less morally culpable than (say) a crime motivated by financial gain: R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136 at [78].

64I reject the Applicant's submission that it can mitigate penalty that the victim was not harmed. The offence is complete when the elements of solicit to murder are established. The crime consists of an intent and a request: Bou-Antoun v R [2008] NSWCCA 1 at [40]. Had there been physical harm inflicted upon the victim, then some other offence would likely be committed. 

65It appears that the victim, after some time, was prepared to maintain contact with the Applicant, despite the fact the victim was in a new relationship. It should be kept in mind that this attitude of the victim has been expressed so far only whilst the Applicant has been in prison. 

66The wisdom of this young woman adopting such an attitude towards the Applicant (who intended to have her murdered) seems, at the least, questionable. However, the absence of evidence of harm to the victim (beyond the appropriate inference that there would have been shock and disturbance on her part on being informed of the plan to murder her) does not assist the Applicant. 

67The attitude of a victim cannot be allowed to interfere with a proper exercise of sentencing discretion. A serious crime such as this is a wrong committed against the community at large and the community itself is entitled to retribution. Matters of general public importance are at the heart of the policies and principles that direct the proper assessment of punishment, the purpose of which is to protect the public, not to mollify the victim: R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at 183-184 [37]; R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128 at [102]ff. To adopt the words used in another solicit to murder case (R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 at 374 [37]-[38]), the fact that the victim adopted a generous attitude to the Applicant was not something on which the Applicant can trade.

68In R v Louizos [2009] NSWCCA 71; 194 A Crim R 223, Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreeing) said at 241 [80]-[81]:

""80 The offence of solicitation is of such a nature that there is less scope for significant variation in the factual basis for the offence or the degree of culpability of the offender than might be the case with other offences to which a standard non-parole period applies. The intention of the offender will never vary; the death of the victim is always intended. The offence will always be unsuccessful in achieving its intended result. One exceptional mitigating factor would be where the offender having solicited the killing of another later, on reflection, takes action to ensure that the murder does not take place. But generally it will be unusual to find a case of solicitation that is not premeditated. There can be variations in the role played by the offender, so that, for example, it may be less serious if the offender is merely the go-between for the principal and the would-be killer. But again given the nature of the offence, in the normal case the fact that the offender was not the instigator will not be significantly mitigating. 

81 There can of course be variations in the motive or reason for which a person seeks to have another murdered but, given the intended consequence of the offender's actions, there generally can be little mitigation found in the purpose behind the solicitation. An exceptional mitigating factor might be that the offence is a result of provocation or that the offender suffers from some form of mental disturbance at the time of the solicitation. These are matters that reduce the offence of murder and, therefore, would be mitigating of the offence of solicitation to murder. But putting those matters to one side it is unlikely that the motivation for the offence will be mitigating. It is more likely that a particular motivation will be an aggravating factor.""

69These statements are pertinent to this case. They serve to emphasise that there was little assistance to the Applicant in the objective circumstances of this offence. The standard non-parole period loomed large as an important factor on sentence in these circumstances. 

70The Applicant had very little operating in his favour on the subjective side. He had a significant criminal history and, at the time of the offence, was effectively a fugitive from justice. There is considerable force in the Crown submission that the standard non-parole period is a more significant factor on sentence where there is little operating in an offender's favour on sentence, and that this is such a case: R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 at [63]. 

71Although it may be said that the Applicant's prior criminal history did not include an offence of the level of seriousness of this one, this provides little comfort when the Applicant has, in effect, escalated or graduated to a crime as serious as solicit to murder.

72Soliciting a person to murder another person is a fundamentally abhorrent and heinous crime, and the sentence for this offence must reflect a significant element of personal and general deterrence: R v Potier at [55].

73Deterrence has a particular relevance when, as here, the Applicant's intended use of a professional killer would reduce the chance of detection, because the Applicant would be able to place himself at some distance from the killing (see [39] above): R v Potier at [56].

74The Applicant went to trial, as was his right, but as a result, he attracted no discount for a plea of guilty. Further, there was and remains a complete absence of contrition and remorse. Given the Applicant's lengthy criminal history and the nature and seriousness of this offence, it remains difficult to make any finding in the Applicant's favour with respect to the risk of reoffending and his prospects of rehabilitation.

75Submissions were made to the sentencing Judge concerning the commencement date of the sentence. It was a matter for his Honour, in the exercise of discretion, to determine the commencement date. The Applicant's breach of parole came about for reasons other than the present offence. The issue of totality was addressed by the fact that the sentence for breach of parole and those for goods in custody were partially concurrent. The approach adopted by the sentencing Judge was available and ought be adopted again in consideration of the present application.

76The present offence was committed whilst the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty, a further factor which exacerbates the Applicant's position on sentence.

77The Applicant's reliance upon sentencing statistics and reference to other sentencing decisions is of very limited assistance: R v Potier at [66]-[68]; Abdul v R at [66]-[71].

78The post-sentence evidence adduced on the application does not add anything significant to the sentencing exercise. The Applicant's period in custody has been unremarkable. 

79That said, the Applicant's prior history disclosed sentences of imprisonment followed by release on parole, where the Applicant has not complied with the terms of his conditional liberty. It remains an open question as to whether the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, and the risk of reoffending, are any better in the context of the sentence he is presently serving. 

80Utilising the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as guideposts, in accordance with the principles in Muldrock, and having regard to all matters relevant to the question of sentence, a conclusion should not be reached that a lesser period of imprisonment ought be imposed upon the Applicant for this crime.

Conclusion

81The present application was filed three years and four months after sentence was passed on 17 February 2010. The sole ground of appeal relied upon is the Muldrock ground. The present application was triggered by the decision in Muldrock.

82If an extension of time had been granted in this case and leave to appeal had also been granted, a conclusion would have been reached that no lesser sentence was warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

83I propose that the Court refuse the Applicant an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence under s.10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

84LATHAM J: I agree with Johnson J.

(vii)on or about 6 March 2006 did assault JA and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on JA (count 7).
4The offending in each of counts 1, 2, 4 and 6 was contrary to s. 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW.  Each of those matters carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  The offending in each of counts 3 and 7 was contrary to s. 61L of the same Act and carried a maximum penalty of 5 years with no prescribed standard non-parole period.  The offending in count 5 was contrary to s. 61N(2) of the same Act and carried a maximum penalty of 18 months imprisonment, again with no prescribed standard non-parole period.
5On 11 December 2008 his Honour Judge Coolahan sentenced the applicant as follows:
(i)in respect of count 1, a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 years to commence on 16 May 2008 and expire on 15 May 2014; 
(ii)in respect of count 2, a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 years commencing on 16 November 2008 and expiring on 15 November 2014;
(iii)in respect of count 3, a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year to commence on 16 May 2009 and expire on 15 May 2010;
(iv)in respect of count 4, a non-parole period of 7 years to commence on 16 November 2010 and expire on 15 November 2017, with a full term of 11 and half years to expire on 15 May 2022; 
(v)in respect of count 5, a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months to commence on 16 July 2009 and expire on 15 November 2009;
(vi)in respect of count 6, a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 years to commence on 16 November 2009 and expire on 15 November 2015;
(vii)in respect of count 7, a fixed term                                                                                                                             of imprisonment of 1 year to commence on 16 May 2010 and expire on 15 May 2011.
6The overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months.  The applicant is eligible for release on 15 November 2017.
7The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  The background to that application is set out in an affidavit of the applicant of 19 September 2013, along with an affidavit of Jasmine Stanton, solicitor, of 19 September 2013.  In summary, the applicant filed a Notice of intention to appeal against conviction and sentence in late December 2008, and made an application for legal aid.  It was not until April 2010 that the applicant was informed that his application for legal aid had been refused.  The applicant, representing himself, proceeded with his appeal against conviction which was dismissed by this Court (see Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 183).  
8In February 2013 the applicant was advised by Ms Stanton that there was a reasonable prospect that an appeal against his sentence might be successful on the basis of a so-called ""Muldrock error"" (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39).  In Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 this Court explained in detail the background to, and the general nature of, so-called ""Muldrock errors"". 
9Following the advice of Ms Stanton, the applicant made an application for legal aid, which was apparently not received.  A further application was completed, counsel was briefed and a notice of application for leave to appeal was filed on 28 June 2013.  
10The Crown has opposed the grant of an extension of time.  
THE FACTS 11The following summary of the facts is taken from the remarks on sentence.
12JA (""the victim""), who was 45 years of age, met the applicant who was then 40 years of age, in January 2005.  They saw each other from time to time thereafter but the victim maintained that at all times their relationship was a purely platonic one, a fact disputed by the applicant.  She said that initially contact was friendly but as time progressed the applicant wanted more from the relationship than she was prepared to give, and that he became increasingly jealous.  
13At some point after Christmas 2005 the victim commenced a relationship with another person. She told the applicant that she did not want to see him again and requested him not to come to her house.  Notwithstanding the victim's request that he not do so, the applicant came to her house on 28 February 2006 (when he left a letter for her) and again on 1 March 2006.   
Count 114On the evening of 5 March 2006 the victim went to bed.  She subsequently woke up and saw a dark shadow in her bedroom whom the jury found to be the applicant.  The applicant put a knife to the lefthand side of the victim's throat and said: ""Don't scream or I'll fucking kill you.""   15The applicant told the victim to put her arms down to her side and then straddled her.  She could tell that he had nothing on the bottom half of his body.  He said:
""I am just going to have some fun while I am here.""  
16The applicant told the victim to remove her nightdress.  Whilst still holding the knife at the victim's throat, the applicant then inserted his fingers into her vagina.  
Count 217After a couple of minutes, the applicant removed his fingers from the victim's vagina and inserted his penis.  At that time the victim did not know where the knife was.  This act of intercourse continued for several minutes but the victim was unsure whether the applicant ejaculated.
Count 318The applicant then trailed the knife down the lefthand side of the victim's stomach whilst talking to her.  Having removed his penis from her vagina, the applicant roughly grabbed the victim's left breast before biting it.  She made a noise when he did so, and the applicant said to her:
""Just be quiet and shut up.""  
Count 419At some stage the applicant said to the victim: ""This knife has been up pussies.""  
20A threat was then made by the applicant in relation to the victim's son, following which the applicant said:""Might fuck you up the arse.  Roll over.""  
21The victim then rolled over and felt the applicant penetrate her anus with his penis.  The victim made a noise due to the pain, whereupon the applicant put his hand over her mouth and pushed her head and face into the pillow to stop her crying out.  This act of intercourse continued for 3 or 4 minutes.
Count 522The applicant then told the victim to roll onto her back and said to her:  
""Put your hand down there"".
23The applicant then took the victim's hand and placed it on his erect penis.  The victim could tell that the applicant was not wearing a condom.  He told the victim to rub his penis, whereupon she stroked it a couple of times before stopping.  
Count 624After the victim had stroked the applicant's penis, he put his penis back into her vagina and instructed her to put her fingers into her vagina at the same time.  The victim put one finger inside her vagina whilst the applicant was still inside her.
Count 725The applicant then removed his penis from the victim's vagina and got off the bed, before wiping himself and the victim with what the victim thought was her nightdress.  The applicant then instructed the victim to roll back over onto her stomach, at which time he said:
""Look what we found here on the floor.""  
26The applicant then felt something being shoved between her legs and knew it was a vibrator which she had purchased some time earlier.  She was not sure whether the vibrator penetrated her or not.  The applicant then said to the victim:
""Don't go to the cops.  I will come back and fucking kill you.""  
27The applicant then left the premises. 
28The victim, in a petrified state, waited for a short time before driving from her house and telephoning the person with whom she was then in a relationship.  She then made a complaint to police.  The victim told police that during the time that the applicant was talking to her, the tone of his voice was one of bitterness, resentment and anger.  
29At the time of making her complaint to the police, the victim suspected that the applicant was the intruder but could not be certain.  The circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown at trial to establish that it was in fact the applicant was obviously accepted by the jury.  
30During the sentence proceedings the Crown tendered a Victim Impact Statement, along with a statement from a social worker and a report from the victim's general practitioner.  Those documents set out the effect of the offending upon the victim.
The findings of the sentencing judge31Commencing at ROS 8, his Honour said:
""As can be seen, the offences, particularly those set out in counts 1, 2, 4 and 6 are extremely serious.  That an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent is to be regarded seriously is obvious from the maximum penalty provided for it as well as the standard nonparole period which it attracts.  As I said, the whole experience was undoubtedly degrading and terrifying.  I have no doubt that the victim feared for her life.  
Further, all the evidence points to the fact no doubt the offence was committed out of jealousy and resentment with the applicant having decided to have what he considered was rightfully his, that is to say a sexual relationship with the victim in the teeth of her unwillingness to do so, a fact which had been abundantly clear to him and must have been clear to him for many months.  There is no doubt that his actions were premeditated and that he did not give a single thought to the consequences for the victim.
The offences, particularly the offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent must result in very significant fulltime custodial sentences.  This is necessary, amongst other things, to ensure that persons of like mind are significantly deterred from adopting the same sort of actions and to ensure that the concerns of the community is reflected by the maximum penalties and standard nonparole periods for those offences are properly addressed"".
32Commencing at ROS 8 his Honour assessed the applicant's subjective case, including the contents of a pre-sentence report which had been tendered.  He also considered, at some length, the character evidence which had been given in the sentence proceedings.  His Honour was not able to reach any definitive conclusion as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation although he did conclude (at ROS 13) that it was unlikely that the applicant would re-offend.
33Finally, his Honour found that there was evidence that the applicant had a propensity to become unwell in times of stress, the point of attempting suicide.  In these circumstances, his Honour found that a custodial sentence would be harsher for the applicant, and found special circumstances.
34In terms of the objective seriousness of the offending, his Honour had particular regard (at ROS 14) to the fact that the offences had been committed in the applicant's home and found that there was some degree of planning involved, although it was not lengthy.  
THE GROUNDS OF APPEALGround 1 - His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.
The findings of the sentencing judge35His Honour found (at ROS 14) that all of the offences were to be regarded as falling within the mid range of objective seriousness.  He then said (at ROS 15):""Having found that counts 1, 2, 4 and 6 fall in the mid range of seriousness, and there having been no pleas of guilty to take into account, the standard nonparole periods, apart from the question of special circumstances, become highly relevant.  Further, because these are separate offences albeit forming part of the one course of conduct over a limited period of time, some partial accumulation is required to reflect the separate criminality involved in the commission of each of the offences"".  

Submissions of the parties36It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour's sentencing discretion had miscarried by reason of the fact that he had, contrary to the decision in Muldrock:
(i)adopted a two stage approach to sentencing;
(ii)given determinative significance to the standard non-parole period; and 
(iii)failed to make proper allowance for the applicant's subjective case on sentence.
37In particular, counsel for the applicant submitted that the passage in [35] above was to be interpreted as the sentencing judge having sentenced the applicant in accordance with the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, such an approach having been found by the High Court in Muldrock to be erroneous.  Counsel submitted, in particular, that his Honour's reference to the fact that there had been no pleas of guilty, along with his reference to the fact that each of counts 1, 2, 4 and 6 attracted a standard non-parole period, supported the conclusion that his Honour had given the standard non-parole period primary significance in the sentencing process. 
38In support of his submissions, counsel for the applicant referred to the decision in R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 where this Court (Beazley P, Johnson and R A Hulme JJ) observed (at [62]) that the standard non-parole period and the maximum sentence are the two legislative guideposts in determining sentence.  In the same case, the Court also observed (at [63]) that the standard non-parole period may be a more significant factor in the case where there is little operating in an offender's favour on sentence.  As I understood it, counsel for the applicant submitted that the absence of any reference by the sentencing judge to the maximum penalty (in the context of his reference to the standard non-parole period) was indicative of the standard non-parole period having been given primary significance. 
39The Crown submitted that no error was made out and further submitted that far from using the standard non-parole period in a mandatory or prescriptive way, his Honour had done no more than refer to it, in effect, as one of a number of relevant considerations he was required to take into account.  The Crown submitted that his Honour's reference to the standard non-parole period being ""highly relevant"" was nothing more than his Honour's acknowledgement that it was to be treated as a statutory guidepost.  
40The Crown also relied upon the fact that the sentences imposed by his Honour were substantially less than the prescribed standard non-parole period.  It was submitted that this was a further indication of the fact that the standard non-parole period had not been given primary or determinative significance.  Counsel for the applicant sought to meet this submission by reliance upon my decision in Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11.
Consideration and conclusion41This Court has observed on numerous occasions that when considering whether a Muldrock type error has been established, it is necessary to view the reasons for sentence as a whole, rather than confine examination to one particular passage or sentence which is said to reflect error see (Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30], citing Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [2] and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43]).  Having read the entirety of his Honour's reasons, I am not satisfied that error has been established. 
42Prior to the passage set out in [35] above, his Honour had comprehensively considered both the objective seriousness of the offending, and the applicant's subjective case.  The terms in which he did so tend against a conclusion that the standard non-parole periods which were applicable to counts 1, 2, 4 and 6 were given primary, let alone determinative, significance.  Rather, his Honour's approach was one which was consistent with the adoption of a process of instinctive synthesis in which all relevant factors were identified, their significance discussed, and a value judgment reached as to the appropriate sentence (as to which see Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J).  
43Further support for the conclusion that no error has been established is to be found in his Honour's reference to the fact that the standard non-parole period was ""highly relevant"".  Apart from being a correct statement, his Honour's use of the term ""highly relevant"" in reference to the standard non-parole period tends against the conclusion that the standard non-parole period was given primary or determinative significance in the sentencing process (see Aslett v R [2012] NSWCCA 235 at [35]).  
44In my view, the decision in Nguyen does not assist the applicant.  To the extent that some inference was sought to be drawn, by reference to that decision, from his Honour's failure to make reference to the maximum penalty being a second statutory guidepost, such an approach runs contrary to the necessity to view the reasons as a whole.  In any event, the observations of this Court in Nguyen were made in the context of a case in which the offender had little in the way of a subjective case.  That could not be said to be the position in the case of the present applicant. 
45Further, and for similar reasons, the decision in Essex does not assist the applicant.  Counsel for the applicant relied upon my observation in that case (at [31]) that what I found to be the erroneous approach of the sentencing judge was not saved by the fact that the non-parole period which was ultimately imposed was less than the prescribed standard.  That observation was made in the context of a case in which the Muldrock error was clear and unequivocal.  For the reasons I have explained, the present case is quite different.  
46For all of these reasons, ground 1 is not made out.    
Ground 2 - His Honour erred in imposing fixed terms of imprisonment for counts 1, 2, and 6.The sentencing judge's findings47His Honour reached the following conclusions in respect of counts 1, 2 and 6 at ROS 16:   
""On count 1 he is sentenced to a fixed term of six years imprisonment to commence on 16 May 2008 and expire on 15 May 2014.  On count 2 he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of six years to commence on 16 November 2008 and expire on 15 November 2014. ... On count 6 he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of six years to commence on 16 November 2009 and expire on 15 November 2015"".  



The submissions of the parties48Counsel for the applicant submitted that there was no discretion to decline to set a non-parole period for an offence which attracted a standard non-parole period in view of s. 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") (see generally SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258; Bellchambers v R [2011] NSWCCA 131).  
49The Crown conceded that a non-parole and an additional term must be set for an offence which attracts a standard non-parole period and that as a consequence, the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1, 2 and 6 were contrary to law.
50The Crown further submitted that the fixed terms imposed should be treated as the equivalent of the non-parole period for the purposes of sentence (see generally R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346; Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129).
Consideration and conclusion51The concession made by the Crown was a proper one.  The sentences imposed in respect of counts 1, 2 and 6 were contrary to the provisions of the Sentencing Act.  The error was a material one (see Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 204 at [83] per Latham J.  It follows that this ground is made out.  
52The issue of whether the fixed terms imposed by his Honour should be regarded as representing the length of the non-parole period or the length of the head sentence in each case was not fully argued in the appeal, and is a matter about which differing views have been expressed (see the discussion of R A Hulme J in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [52] - [62]).  In any event, and absent any other basis on which this Court considers that it should intervene, re-sentencing the applicant in respect of counts 1, 2 and 6 will make no difference to the aggregate non-parole period, or the aggregate sentence, in light of the sentence imposed in respect of count 4 (see Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95 at [49] per Latham J, Button J and Grove AJ agreeing).
THE APPLICATION TO EXTEND TIMEThe applicable principles53 In Abdul (supra) this Court said (at [53]):
""Accordingly, when considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time"".
54The delay in the present case is sought to be largely explained upon the basis of a change in applicable sentencing principles following the decision in Muldrock.  However, for the reasons already expressed, no Muldrock error has been made out.  Further, although ground 2 has been made out, it is independent of ground 1 and could have been brought at the time of the hearing of the applicant's appeal against conviction.  The affidavit evidence advances no explanation as to why this course was not taken, although it might be inferred that it was due to the fact that legal aid had been refused and the applicant was unrepresented.  
55In the present case, the evidence of the impact upon the victim which was before the sentencing judge was somewhat greater than is generally the case, and extended to reports from a social worker and the victim's general practitioner.  The effect of the applicant's offending upon the victim was obviously significant, such that an extension of time may well have an adverse impact upon her.  It would also offend the principle of finality.  In my view, all of these matters tend against granting of an extension of time.
56However, for the reasons which have been outlined, material error has been established in respect of ground 2.  For the reasons explained in Abdul, it is therefore necessary to assess the prospects of success of the application for leave to appeal.  In doing so, the Court must consider whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s. 6(3)).
Is some other sentence warranted in law?Submissions of the parties57It was emphasised on behalf of the applicant that in order to establish that some other sentence was warranted in law, it was not necessary to establish that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, and that it is a matter for the Court to re-exercise its statutory discretion (see generally Baxter (supra)).  
58It was submitted that the applicant's subjective circumstances were not properly reflected in the ultimate sentence imposed.  In this regard, counsel pointed to the fact that there was evidence that as a consequence of his offending the applicant had suffered significant extra curial punishment as the consequence of the loss of his job and his home, and as a result of being declared bankrupt.  
59Reliance was also placed on the evidence that the applicant had suffered depression and had attempted suicide, as well as the fact that his Honour had found that he was unlikely to re-offend.  Finally, the applicant relied upon sentencing statistics, along with sentences imposed in other cases which were said to be factually comparable.  
60The Crown submitted that his Honour had comprehensively set out the entirety of the subjective material relied upon by the applicant and had obvious regard to those subjective matters, not only in relation to the individual sentences but also in relation to the degree of accumulation which the Crown described as ""moderate"". 
61The Crown submitted that a degree of accumulation was required in the present case because it could not be said that the criminality of each of the offences was completely subsumed by that of the others.  It was also pointed out that the extent of the accumulation had not been challenged by the applicant. 
62In terms of the applicant's reliance upon sentencing statistics, the Crown relied on a number of previous decisions in which this Court had spoken about the about the caution with which any statistical analysis ought be approached (see for example FB v R; R v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217; Lang v R [2013] NSWCCA 29).  In this regard, the Crown submitted that the cases relied upon by the applicant provided no assistance because of the differentiating circumstances, and placed particular reliance upon the observations of Adamson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) in Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 at [45].  
Consideration and conclusion63In my view, there is no merit in the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant.  
64His Honour comprehensively reviewed all aspects of the applicant's subjective case (at ROS 8 to ROS 15).  In doing so, he referred to each and every one of the subjective matters cited by counsel for the applicant in submissions before this Court.  Clearly, all of those matters were taken into account in determining sentence.  It is also relevant to note that the applicant maintained his innocence, such that it was not open to his Honour to take into account any expressed remorse or contrition for the offending.  
65Moreover, when sentencing the applicant his Honour was required to balance the applicant's subjective case against what was, on any view, serious offending.  He properly pointed out (at ROS 8) that the offending would obviously have been degrading and terrifying for the victim, and that general deterrence was of particular significance.    
66Further, and in circumstances where the applicant and the victim had previously known one another but where the applicant had maintained that the relationship was a platonic one, his Honour found that the offending was motivated by feelings of jealousy and resentment on the part of the applicant.  That finding was not challenged on appeal.
67Finally, his Honour found (at ROS 8) that the offending was pre-mediated and that the applicant, having determined to act in the way in which he did, engaged in repeated and degrading offending towards the victim.  That finding was similarly not challenged.
68All of those circumstances to which his Honour referred called for the imposition of condign punishment.
69For these reasons, no injustice has arisen as a consequence of the sentence imposed, and no lesser sentence is warranted in law.
ORDER70I propose the following order:
(i)The application for an extension of time is dismissed.

2762736,Kentwell v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 266,"Judgment1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J and the orders which he proposes.
2JOHNSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
3BELLEW J: On 15 September 2008, following a trial, the applicant was found guilty of the following offences:
(i)on 29 October 2007 did recklessly cause grievous bodily harm to WN contrary to s. 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW (count 1);
(ii)on 29 October 2007 did maliciously destroy a glass candle holder the property of WN contrary to s. 195(1)(a) of the same Act (count 3);
(iii)on or about 29 October 2007 did have sexual intercourse with WN without her consent, knowing that WN was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, contrary to s. 61I of the same Act (count 4); 
(iv)on 2 November 2007 did assault WN contrary to s. 61 of the same Act (count 5);
(v)on or about 2 November 2007 did have sexual intercourse with WN without her consent, knowing that WN was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, contrary to s. 61I of the same Act (count 7).
4The maximum penalties for the offences of which the applicant was found guilty were as follows:
(i)Count 1 - imprisonment for 10 years;
(ii)Count 5 - imprisonment for 2 years;
(iii)Count 3 - imprisonment for 5 years;
(iv)Counts 4 and 7 - imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 
5On 20 February 2009 the applicant was sentenced as follows:
(i)in respect of count 1, a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 6 April 2008 and concluding on 5 April 2012;
(ii)in respect of count 3, a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 month commencing on 6 April 2008 and concluding on 5 May 2008;
(iii)in respect of count 4 a fixed term of imprisonment of 7 years commencing on 6 August 2008 and concluding on 5 August 2015; 
(iv)in respect of count 5 a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months commencing on 6 December 2008 and expiring on 5 March 2009;
(v)in respect of count 7 a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 6 April 2009 and expiring on 5 April 2016 with an additional period of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 6 April 2016 and expiring on 5 April 2020.
6The overall sentence was one of 12 years imprisonment, comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and an additional term of 4 years.  The applicant's earliest date of release is 5 April 2016. 
7The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  The background to that application is set out in his affidavit of 17 September 2013, along with an affidavit of Ruth Chalmers, solicitor, of 18 September 2013.  The applicant has deposed to the fact that on the day he was sentenced (20 February 2009) he completed a Notice of intention to appeal against conviction and sentence.  At that time he was represented by the Aboriginal Legal Service.  He was then told that his case would be transferred to Legal Aid NSW due to a conflict of interest, the nature of which has not been further explained.  The applicant completed an application for legal aid on 24 March 2010 but was not advised until 25 January 2011 that his application had been refused.  
8On 31 August 2012 Ms Chalmers reviewed the transcript of the applicant's sentence proceedings and determined that there may be merit in an appeal due to a so-called ""Muldrock error"" (see Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39).  The background to, and the general nature of, such errors was explained by this Court in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.   
9After Ms Chalmers had reviewed the matter, Counsel was briefed to advise and in February 2013 Ms Chalmers wrote to the applicant inviting him to complete an application for legal aid.  He did so, and after submissions had been received from counsel, a Notice of application for leave to appeal was filed on 28 June 2013.  
10The Crown has opposed the grant of an extension of time.    
THE FACTS11The following summary is taken from his Honour's remarks on sentence. 
12 At the time of the offending, the applicant had known the victim for about four years.  From about January 2007 they formed an intimate relationship as a result of which the applicant would stay over at the victim's premises four or five nights per week.  In August 2007 the victim made a complaint to the police about the applicant and he was charged with various offences including assault, stealing and contravening a domestic violence order.  He was released on bail and thereafter renewed his relationship with the victim. 
13On the afternoon of 29 October 2007 the applicant went to the victim's home when he was affected by alcohol.  When the victim was in the kitchen making coffee, the applicant approached her from behind and poured liquid over her head.  Without warning he then smashed a beer bottle over her head causing her to fall to the floor.  As the victim lay on the floor the applicant kicked her several times in the ribs, causing her immediate pain and difficulty breathing.  The applicant refused the victim's request to call an ambulance.    
14The victim tried to leave the premises and told the applicant she was going to her sister's.  As she walked outside the applicant grabbed her by the hair and pulled her to the ground.  He then kicked her in the chest area and pulled her back inside.  Once inside the applicant again kicked the victim before ordering her to get up.  
15There then followed an interlude as the applicant tried to comfort the victim, telling her to sit next to him on the couch. The victim did so out of fear but within a short period the applicant started yelling at her and began to throw various objects within his reach including the victim's mobile phone, remote controls for the television and DVD player, an ash tray and a glass candle holder that smashed at the other end of the room.  
16When the victim went over and knelt down to pick up the smashed candle holder the applicant again attacked her, hitting her over the head and shoulders with a metal bracket from an air conditioner.  The applicant then appeared to calm down and sat in the lounge room.  Because she was in fear of the applicant, the victim did not leave the premises or contact the police.  She continued to experience difficulties with her breathing, her head was sore, she was aching and she felt nauseated.  She went to the bathroom and showered before getting into bed.
17The applicant then called out to the victim from the lounge room asking if she wanted a ""doorey"", which meant sex.  The victim said no.  Over the course of the next few hours the applicant repeatedly requested sex, and the victim repeatedly refused.  
18The applicant then came into the bedroom.  The victim again told him that she did not want to have sex as she was in too much pain from the earlier assaults.  The applicant said:
 ""Fucking girls only have to spread their fucking legs.  It won't hurt.""  
19The victim did not want to have sex with the applicant but at this time could see that he was not going to stop his demands.  Accordingly, she said to him:
 ""If you do it just get it over and done with quickly.""  
20The applicant then removed the victim's underpants and commenced penile intercourse by penetrating her vagina from behind.  The applicant was much larger than the victim and as a consequence, she was affected by his heavy weight and experienced severe pain.  She begged the applicant to stop and she started to cry.  The applicant allowed her to move into a foetal position but did not stop the intercourse and told her to ""stop blubbering"".  The applicant continued to have penile/vaginal sexual intercourse until he ejaculated.   
21After the intercourse had ended, the applicant remained in the bed.  The victim attempted to sleep but was unable to do so because of her pain.  She did not leave as she was in fear of the applicant and as the night continued her breathing was laboured.  The applicant complained that she was making too much noise and told her to ""shut up"".  
22The following morning the applicant awoke at about 7.30am and asked for sex.  The victim replied:
""No Didge, I can't because I can't do this.  You can't keep doing this to me anymore.""  
23The applicant then left the premises, following which the victim sought treatment from a medical centre.  She was diagnosed (without X-Rays being taken) as having fractured ribs and was told to take painkillers.  She returned to her home and went back to bed. 
24On 2 November 2007 the victim saw her General Practitioner.  X-Rays taken on that occasion established that she had fractures to her fifth, sixth and seventh right ribs, as well as to her fourth left rib.  There was also evidence of trauma to her fifth and sixth left ribs.  
25Later that same afternoon, the applicant arrived at the victim's premises with a companion named Nash.  The applicant and Nash started drinking in the lounge room and as the applicant became affected by the alcohol he started to accuse the victim of sleeping with Nash.  The victim denied this allegation and told Nash to leave.  The applicant and the victim sat together on the lounge, at which time the applicant began igniting a cigarette lighter on and off, at one point applying the flame to the victim's forearm.  After she pulled her arm away the applicant began lighting small pieces of paper on the coffee table before beginning to hit the victim whilst calling her a ""fucking mole"" and a ""whore"".  He then started to twist her arm, at which time she retreated to the bathroom.  The applicant continued to accuse the victim of having ""sex with wogs"" before telling her to ""get her arse out of the bathroom"".  The victim went back into the bedroom where the applicant grabbed her and held her up against the wall next to a cupboard.  
26The applicant then said he wanted something to eat, at which point the victim made a meal for him, before going to bed.  The applicant then asked her for sex.  The victim repeatedly said she did not want to, telling the applicant she was in too much pain.  The applicant responded by saying:
 ""Just spread your legs.  That's all you have to do.""  
27The victim again told the applicant that she was unable to breath properly and that the pain was too much, to which the applicant responded:
 ""You won't feel it.""  
28Feeling that she had no choice, and although she did not want to have sex with the applicant, the victim said: 
""Just get it over and done with please and hurry.""  
29The applicant then commenced to have penile vaginal sex with the victim as she lay on her stomach.  As he did so, the victim experienced severe pain to her injured ribs and chest, telling the applicant:
""I don't want to do it .... I've got broken ribs .... Didge I can't do this.  I can't do this anymore.  I can't"".  
30The applicant ignored these pleas, and continued until he ejaculated.    
31On 6 November 2007 the applicant again sought medical attention and on this occasion disclosed that she had been sexually assaulted. She then made a statement to police.  
THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL Ground 1 - His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.The approach taken by the sentencing judge32At ROS 17, under the heading ""The standard non-parole periods"" his Honour said (at paragraphs [34] and [35]):
34. Having regard to the findings I have made, the standard nonparole periods which apply to several of the offences are relevant: s 54D Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
35. However, there is in my view nothing in the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, nor in any other factors, that persuades me that any variation in the standard nonparole period for these offences is justified except as they may be affected by the application of the principles of totality.
Submissions of the parties33Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge's discretion miscarried by reason of the fact that he:
(i)adopted a two stage approach to sentencing;
(ii)gave determinative significance to the standard non-parole period; and
(iii)failed to make proper allowance for the applicant's subjective case.
34It was submitted that these errors were contrary to the approach identified by the High Court in Muldrock.  
35In written submissions, the Crown argued that on a reading of the entirety of the sentencing remarks it was apparent that his Honour had adopted a process of instinctive synthesis in which he had taken account of all of the relevant factors and had then determined what he considered to be the appropriate sentence.  However in oral submissions, the Crown accepted that it would be open to this Court to conclude, on the basis of paragraphs [34] and [35] of his Honour's reasons, that there was error.
Consideration and conclusion 36In my view, the sentencing judge clearly used the standard non-parole period as a starting point in determining the appropriate sentences in respect of counts 4 and 7.  He approached the sentencing task on the basis that the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Act"") mandated the imposition of the standard non-parole period in the event that relevant factors did not justify a departure from it.  In doing so, his Honour adopted a two stage sentencing process, and gave the standard non-parole period determinative significance.  In light of the decision in Muldrock that approach reflected error.  
37Moreover, that error was material in the sense that it clearly had the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion (see Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 204 at [83]).
38It follows that this ground is made out.
Ground 2 - His Honour erred by increasing the balance of term and thereby impermissibly increasing the length of the sentence for the s. 61I offence on 2 November 2007 to reflect a finding of special circumstances.The findings of the sentencing judge39The offence against s. 61I which was committed on 2 November 2007 was that in count 7.  
40As previously noted, his Honour imposed the standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment in respect of that offence, with an additional term 342of 4 years imprisonment.  His Honour had earlier found special circumstances (at ROS 18 paragraph [39]) on the basis of the applicant's need for medical attention upon release, both in respect of his psychiatric condition and his drug and alcohol abuse.
Submissions of the parties41It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour had determined that the standard non-parole period of 7 years should be imposed and that this necessarily became the starting point for sentence.  Applying the statutory ratio, it was submitted that the resultant head sentence should have been one of 9 years and 3 months.
42Counsel submitted that his Honour had given effect to his finding of special circumstances by extending the balance of the term of imprisonment, rather than by reducing the non-parole period.  It was submitted that the finding of special circumstances should have resulted in a downward adjustment of the non-parole period, and that it was not permissible to extend the balance of a term beyond the statutory proportion, and thus increase the length of the sentence, in order to reflect a finding of special circumstances (see R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218).
43The Crown submitted that there was nothing in the remarks on sentence to suggest that his Honour had adopted the mathematical exercise suggested on behalf of the applicant.  The Crown submitted that it was apparent from discussion during the sentencing proceedings that his Honour was aware that he could reduce the standard non-parole period if there were special circumstances which warranted that course.
Consideration and conclusion44For the reasons advanced by counsel for the applicant, there is an inconsistency between the finding of special circumstances on the one hand, and the structure of the sentence imposed in respect of count 7 on the other.  That inconsistency reflects error.  
45However, the overall sentence imposed was a non-parole period of 8 years, with an additional term of 12 years.  That overall sentence is consistent with a finding of special circumstances.  In these circumstances, although error has been made out, it is one which in my view is immaterial.
Ground 3 - His Honour erred in setting a fixed term of imprisonment for the offences which carried a standard non-parole period - the s. 35(2) offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and s. 61I of sexual intercourse without consent on 29 October 2007.The findings of the sentencing judge46At the commencement of the hearing, senior counsel for the applicant conceded that contrary to the information provided to the sentencing judge, no standard non-parole period was prescribed for the offence under s. 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (count 1).  Accordingly, this ground was limited to the fixed term of 7 years imprisonment imposed in respect of the offence in count 4.    
Submissions of the parties47It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that there is no discretion to decline to set a non-parole period for an offence which attracts a standard non-parole period (see SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258; Bellchambers v R [2011] NSWCCA 131).  
48The Crown conceded that in view of the provisions of s. 45(1) of the Sentencing Act his Honour had erred in respect of the sentence imposed in respect of count 4.  However, the Crown submitted that the appropriate inference to be drawn was that his Honour had intended that the fixed term which was imposed represent the non-parole period (see R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346; Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129).  The Crown also pointed out that the term imposed in respect of count 4 would be subsumed in the sentence for count 7 and submitted that in these circumstances, re-sentencing made no difference to the end result.  
Consideration and conclusion49The concession made by the Crown was a proper one.  The sentence imposed in respect of count 4 was contrary to the provisions of the Sentencing Act.    
50Whether the fixed term imposed by his Honour should be regarded as representing the length of the non-parole period or the length of the head sentence was something which was not fully argued in the present case.  It is a matter about which differing views have been expressed (see the discussion of R A Hulme J in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [52] - [62]).  However, the offence in count 4 carried a standard non-parole period of 7 years and his Honour found (at ROS 11, paragraph [12]) that the offending was in the mid range.  It would be reasonable in these circumstances to conclude that the fixed term represented the non-parole period. Absent any other basis on which this Court considers that it should intervene, re-sentencing the applicant on count 4 will make no difference to the aggregate non-parole period, or the aggregate sentence (see Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95 at [49] per Latham J, Button J and Grove AJ agreeing). 
51In these circumstances, although error has been established, I do not regard that error as material.  
Ground 4 - His Honour erred in his consideration of the psychiatric evidenceThe psychiatric evidence 52Tendered before his Honour were two reports of Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist.  The first was a report of 11 September 2008 in which Dr Allnutt reached (inter alia) the following conclusions:
""In my opinion, at the time that I saw your client, he was manifesting ongoing auditory hallucinations that had onset approximately one year prior following the commencement of methamphetamine abuse. In addition to this, he manifested some mild paranoid ideas and ideas of reference. Thus at the material time that I saw him, he manifested ongoing symptoms of a psychosis. Given that his psychosis persisted months after incarceration, in the absence of evidence of further substance abuse since his incarceration, consideration could be given to a chronic psychotic disorder, however, methamphetamines (sic) induced psychosis can cause a more persisting syndrome of psychotic symptoms than other substances so I cannot entirely rule out a yet to resolve drug induced psychosis.""
53In a second report of 19 February 2009 Dr Allnutt said:
""Having regard to the information provided to me, there is limited evidence of overt psychotic symptoms in the time preceding the onset of methamphetamine abuse. He appears to have a history of a fluctuating mood disorder in that period (likely associated with substances abuse). After the onset of methamphetamines there is evidence for the emergence of symptoms of psychosis, particularly of a paranoid nature (believing people are after him), that his girlfriend was having sex with others behind his back (potentially delusions of infidelity), that the TV was communicating with him (ideas of reference) and that he was hearing voices (auditory hallucinations).
These symptoms have been relatively persistent since then and persist to date despite anti-psychotic medication which suggests that there is a disease process that is occurring independent of methamphetamines. Methamphetamines can induce a syndrome of symptoms that mimic schizophrenia and thus it can be hard to distinguish between a methamphetamine-induced psychosis and schizophrenia. While methamphetamines can result in a persistence of psychotic symptoms, I believe that at this stage, the duration of these symptoms are of a nature that would suggest his condition cannot be explained by drugs alone and that a persisting psychotic disorder (such as schizophrenia) has developed. 
Overall, at the material time that the alleged offence occurred I believe there is evidence to support the conclusion that your client was experiencing delusional beliefs compounded by auditory hallucinations and ideas of reference which incorporated his girlfriend leading him to form the view that she was being unfaithful to him and that these symptoms were active at the material time that the alleged offence occurred.""
The findings of the sentencing judge 54The sentencing judge dealt with the psychiatric evidence commencing at ROS 14, paragraph [27].  Having made reference to the reports of Dr Allnutt, particularly the opinion expressed in the second of those reports set out in [53] above, his Honour said (at ROS 15, paragraph [29]):
""This opinion of the doctor is almost entirely dependent on his acceptance of what the applicant told him.  Having regard to the character and antecedents of the applicant I would have to profess a certain degree of scepticism in this regard.  Nevertheless I am told that Dr Allnutt is a respected criminal psychologist (sic) and, as he was not required for crossexamination, I am prepared to take his opinion at face value.  
Even at its highest this medical opinion does in no way justify the behaviour of the applicant.  It cannot be said to have had any connection with the sexual offences.  It may go some way to explaining his use of violence towards her due to his psychotic beliefs but that is the high point of the opinion insofar as the question of moral culpability is concerned.""  
55By reference to the judgment of Sperling J in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 28 at [33] - [36] his Honour (at ROS 15, paragraph [31]) cited the general principles which are applicable to sentencing a mentally ill offender.  Those principles have since been refined, following a review of the authorities, by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 at [177] - [178].  In the present case, the sentencing judge stated the principles in the following terms:  
""Firstly, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the call for denunciation and penalty may be reduced.  I am not satisfied that the mental illness contributed to the commission of the offences in a material way.  Secondly, the applicant may be an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence which may moderate that consideration.  I do not believe that the principle of general deterrence is inappropriate for this applicant.  Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person.  I am prepared to accept that particular contention.  The question of the mental condition might also be relevant in terms of special circumstances so far as the need for treatment is concerned either during his imprisonment or subsequent to it, and I will come back to this when I deal with special circumstances.
56His Honour's findings as to special circumstances have been previously noted (at [40] above). Submissions of the parties57It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that having taken Dr Allnutt's opinion ""at face value"", his Honour erred by concluding that the applicant's mental state had not contributed to the sexual offending.  It was submitted that in expressing his opinion Dr Allnutt had not drawn any distinction, in terms of the applicant's mental illness, between the sexual offending and the other offending.  It was submitted that in these circumstances there was an inconsistency between his Honour's apparent acceptance of Dr Allnutt's opinion on the one hand, and his findings on the other.  In particular, it was submitted that his Honour's finding that there was no connection between the applicant's mental illness and the offending effectively amounted to a rejection of Dr Allnutt's opinion, in circumstances where his Honour appeared to have expressed a general acceptance of it.
58It was further submitted that in circumstances where there was a documented history of mental illness contained within the reports of Dr Allnutt, his Honour's observation that Dr Allnutt's opinions were ""almost entirely dependent"" upon acceptance of the information provided by the applicant was also an error.  It was also submitted that in the light of that documented history, his Honour's expressed scepticism was somewhat misplaced. 
59The Crown submitted that Dr Allnutt's opinions were at least partly dependent upon what the applicant had told him and that the expressed scepticism of the sentencing judge was warranted.  The Crown further submitted that in circumstances where the applicant had not given evidence, his Honour was entitled to give little, if any, weight to Dr Allnutt's opinions (see generally R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369).
Consideration and conclusion60No complaint has been made regarding his Honour's statement of the relevant principles applicable to sentencing a mentally ill offender (at [55] above).  Further, in light of the applicant's history, adopting a cautious approach to the reliability of anything said by him was not without justification.61
62However, in the first of his reports Dr Allnutt (commencing at p. 2) undertook a comprehensive review of the material pertaining to the applicant's medical history which had been provided by Justice Health.  That material established that as long ago as January 1995 the applicant was reported as having mental health problems.  Later complaints of suicidal thoughts and auditory hallucinations were accompanied by objective evidence of mental health disturbance, including evidence of attempts at self harm and outbursts of anger.  The attending medical practitioner(s) thought the applicant's condition was sufficiently serious to warrant prescription of, and later increases in, anti-psychotic medication.  
63On the material made available to Dr Allnutt, these mental health issues  extended up to, and beyond, the date of the offending.  None of them were referred to by his Honour in his remarks on sentence.   In the circumstances, his Honour's observation that Dr Allnutt's opinion was based almost entirely upon the information provided to him by the applicant was, in my view, not correct and reflected a material error.    
64Further, in the absence of a more definitive statement, his Honour's observation that he was prepared to ""take (Dr Allnutt's) opinion at face value"" can only be interpreted as a general acceptance of such opinion.  Part of Dr Allnutt's opinion was that at the time of the offending, the applicant was experiencing delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations and ideas of reference which incorporated his view that the victim had been unfaithful to him.  Clearly, Dr Allnutt took the view that there was a causal connection between the applicant's mental illness and his offending.  He drew no distinction between the particular offences in this respect.  
65In these circumstances, I am not able to reconcile his Honour's apparent acceptance of Dr Allnutt's opinion with his conclusion that the applicant's mental illness had not contributed to the sexual offending in a material way.  It follows that his Honour's conclusion in this regard was also reflective of material error.
66Finally, his Honour found that principles of general deterrence remained an appropriate consideration in the sentencing of the applicant.  The reason(s) which led him to that conclusion were not explained.  The opinions of Dr Allnutt supported the conclusion that the applicant suffered from a serious mental illness.  That illness rendered the applicant an inappropriate vehicle through which to deter others from similar offending (see Muldrock at [55]).  His Honour's finding to the contrary reflected further material error.  
67For all of these reasons, this ground is made out.
THE APPLICATION TO EXTEND TIMEThe applicable principles68 In Abdul (supra) this Court said (at [53]):
""Accordingly, when considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time"".
69Although not as significant as those periods of delay which have been considered by this Court in other cases of so-called Mudrock error, the delay in the present case is nevertheless substantial.  It is sought to be explained on the basis of a change in applicable sentencing principles following the decision in Muldrock.  However, grounds (2), (3) and (4) were grounds which were independent of any asserted Muldrock error.  Had the applicant wished to bring an appeal based on those grounds he could have done so at a far earlier time.  His failure to do so is largely unexplained, although it may have been the result of a change in his representation (which was a matter not of his choosing) and the significant delay in assessing his application for legal aid (which was not his fault).  That said, it is at least possible that an extension of time may have an impact upon the victim.  It would also offend the principle of finality.  The majority of these considerations tend against granting an extension of time.
70However, for the reasons which have been outlined, a number of material errors have been established.  For the reasons explained in Abdul, it is therefore necessary to assess the prospects of success of the application for leave to appeal.  In doing so, the Court must consider whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s. 6(3)).
Is some lesser sentence warranted in law?Submissions of the parties71Senior counsel for the applicant firstly submitted that the offending in count 1 involved kicking with a bare foot and that although the injuries would obviously have been painful for the victim, they were nevertheless in the low range of injuries which constitute grievous bodily harm.  For these reasons it was submitted that this offending fell towards the lower end of the scale.  
72Further, and whilst acknowledging that it was relevant to take into account the fact that the victim suffered pain during the instances of forced intercourse, senior counsel stressed that the injuries to the victim had not been inflicted by the applicant at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the sexual offences.  It was also submitted that the applicant's sexual offending should be assessed in the context of the relationship which existed between himself and the victim, and that this circumstance mitigated such offending.
73Senior Counsel also submitted that the applicant's criminal history should be assessed according to his background.  That background included the fact that he had been adopted at 12 months of age to a non-indigenous family and had suffered from a drinking problem from the age of 15. Reliance was also placed upon the evidence of the applicant's mental illness to which I have previously referred. 
74Finally, reliance was placed upon sentencing statistics and what were said to be sentences imposed in cases of offending which were factually comparable. 
75The Crown submitted that in determining the appropriate sentence in respect of count 1, the injuries sustained by the victim were simply one of a number of factors to be taken into account.  The Crown also pointed to the unprovoked and prolonged nature of the initial attack perpetrated on the victim, in the context of a history of domestic violence. 
76The Crown also submitted that the circumstance of any sexual relationship between the applicant and the victim was not relevant.  It was submitted that the fact that the applicant was not a stranger to the victim did not mitigate the objective seriousness of the offending and that the more relevant factor was that it took place in the context of a history of domestic violence.  The Crown also pointed to the inherent seriousness of the offending, and the fact that it was committed at a time when the applicant was on conditional liberty.  For these reasons the Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted in law.
Consideration and conclusion77The applicant's offending was obviously serious and for a number of reasons I am not able to accept the submission advanced on his behalf that the offending in count 1 should be viewed as falling towards the lower end of the scale.  
78The result of offending of the kind encompassed by count 1 is not the only consideration relevant to a determination of its seriousness (see R v Mansour; R v Hughes [2013] NSWCCA 35 at [31] - [32]).  Moreover, it is particularly significant that in the present case the mode of inflicting the injuries was kicking, an act which has been described as being ""a familiar method of inflicting serious injury in modern times"" which is to be regarded by the courts as ""abhorrent and worthy ... of condign punishment"" (see R v Wright [1998] VSCA 84 at [2] cited with approval by Johnson J in AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 at [81]).  The fact that the kicking was executed with bare feet does not, in my view, render it any less serious. 
79Having acted in such a violent way, a period of time elapsed before the sexual offending commenced.  During that period of time, the victim made it clear, on more than one occasion, that she did not wish to have sex with the applicant.  It was open to the applicant to respect the victim's wishes and desist from further offending.  Rather than do that, he proceeded to force sexual intercourse on the victim, disregarding both her repeated refusals and her subsequent complaints of pain.  That offending was repeated in a similar way on a second occasion some days later, again in the context of unprovoked acts of violence towards the victim.  On each of those occasions, the applicant made a number of degrading and disrespectful statements to the victim, from which it is abundantly clear that he regarded her as nothing more than a vehicle for his own sexual gratification.
80The applicant is not assisted by his criminal history. Whilst he has not been previously convicted of sexual offending, he has countless previous convictions for offences of violence.  His Honour properly concluded that the applicant's criminal history demonstrated that the violent offending committed in this case was not uncharacteristic.    
81As previously noted, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the sexual offending was mitigated by the fact that it had occurred in the context of a relationship between the applicant and the victim.  In NM v R [2012] NSWCCA 215, Macfarlan JA (commencing at [56]) reviewed the authorities concerning the significance, in terms of sentencing, of a relationship between an offender and a victim.  His Honour concluded (at [59], McCallum J and Grove AJ agreeing) that in light of the originally lengthy, and later intermittent, sexual relationship which had existed between the offender and the victim in that case, the offending could not be equated to offending which involved sexual assaults by strangers.  In doing so, his Honour observed (at [59]):
""Here, the victim had been prepared until moments before the assaults to have sexual intercourse with the appellant, and the complainant had indeed, only three minutes before the applicant's arrival at her home, invited him over for that very purpose.  My view is that in these circumstances, the sentencing judge erred in characterising the offences as falling within the mid-range of seriousness.  They were in my view well below that, although not at the bottom of the range"".
82His Honour had occasion to further consider this issue in Norman v R [2012] NSWCCA 230, a case which involved three instances of sexual intercourse without consent committed in the course of a marriage of 13 years duration, each instance having commenced with consensual intercourse.  Having referred to his judgment in NM his Honour said (at [60], Price and McCallum JJ agreeing):
""... the objective seriousness of offences such as the present needs to be assessed in the context of the relationship between the offender and the complainant"". 83Whilst the existence of a relationship between an offender and a victim is a relevant consideration in determining the objective seriousness of sexual offending, each case turns on its own facts.  In particular, it is necessary to have regard to the nature and extent of any such relationship in determining whether it mitigates the offending.
84In the present case, his Honour found that the applicant and the victim had formed an intimate relationship in 2007, in the course of which the applicant would stay at the victim's premises on several nights each week.  That relationship deteriorated to the point where, in August 2007, the victim made a complaint to police about the applicant.  Obviously, the relationship between the applicant and the victim was renewed, although it is not clear precisely when this occurred.  It is difficult to ascertain the precise extent of the relationship at the time of the offending.  His Honour's reference (at ROS 5) to the fact that the applicant had ""continued to visit"" the victim would indicate that they were not living together.
85Whatever the extent of their relationship might have been when the offending occurred, the factual circumstances of such offending were markedly different to those considered by Macfarlan JA in NM.  In particular, this was not a case in which the victim had invited, or was at any time prepared to engage in, sexual intercourse with the applicant.  On the contrary, she repeatedly stated that she did not wish to do so.  
86The present facts are also quite different from those considered by this Court in Norman.  In particular, the applicant and the victim in the present case were not married.  
87The sentencing judge in the present case cited the observations of Wood CJ at CL (with whom Studdert  and Bell JJ agreed) in R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436; (2001) 125 A Crim R 551 at [41]:
""As this court has confirmed in Glenn (NSWCCA 19.12.1994), Ross (NSWCCA 20.11.1996), Rowe (1996) 89 A Crim R 467, Fahda (1999) NSWCCA 267 and Powell (2000) NSWCCA 108, violent attacks in domestic settings must be treated with real seriousness.  Regrettably, that form of conduct involves aggression by men who are physically stronger than their victims and who are often in a position economically, or otherwise, to enforce their silence and their acceptance of such conduct.  In truth such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the Courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished, and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.""
88These principles were confirmed, after a review of the relevant authorities, by Johnson J (with whom Hunt AJA and Latham J agreed) in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 (at [65] and following).  
89In my view, when considering the relationship between the applicant and the victim, and in considering whether that relationship mitigates the offending, an important consideration is that the offending occurred in the context of significant domestic violence perpetrated upon the victim by the applicant.  Whatever their relationship might have been, the acts of domestic violence which preceded each instance of forced sexual intercourse were serious, unprovoked and unwarranted.  This was a matter to which his Honour properly had regard.  
90The nature of the respective relationships and the context of the respective offending considered by this Court in NM and Norman are readily distinguishable from those in the present case.  For all of these reasons, the nature and extent of any relationship between the applicant and the victim does not, in my view, operate to mitigate the offending.       
91Although material error has been established, none of the matters advanced on behalf of the applicant, including the applicant's mental illness, support a conclusion that there has been substantial injustice arising out of the sentence imposed, or that some other sentence is warranted in law.  
ORDER92I propose the following order:
(i)The application for an extension of time is dismissed.

2762737,Dulihanty v R [2013] NSWCCA 275,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the order which he proposes.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Michael Francis Dulihanty, applies for an extension of time to appeal against sentence imposed at the Sydney District Court on 23 June 2009 for an offence (committed in December 2005) of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s.33(1) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of seven years applies. 

3The Applicant was convicted following trial by jury which extended from 28 April 2009 to 5 May 2009. On 23 June 2009, his Honour Judge CJ Armitage sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years commencing on 30 March 2009 and expiring on 29 March 2014, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 30 March 2014 and expiring on 29 March 2017. 

The Present Application

4It appears that, on or about 1 July 2010, the Applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Applicant sought legal aid for the purpose of his proposed appeal. On 20 August 2011, senior counsel provided an advice concluding that an appeal against conviction and/or sentence did not have reasonable prospects of success. Legal aid was refused. 

5The Notice of Intention to Appeal lapsed. 

6Following the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""), a review process was established within Legal Aid NSW concerning standard non-parole period cases. 

7On 28 June 2013, a Notice of Application for Extension of Time to seek leave to appeal against sentence was filed in this Court.

8The sole ground of appeal communicated by the Applicant contends that the sentencing Judge erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles in Muldrock.

9The concept of Muldrock error was explained in R v Abdul [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19]-[28].

10The Crown concedes that Muldrock error is demonstrated in this case. However, the Crown contends that no lesser sentence is warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that the extension of time ought be refused.

11In Abdul v R at [42]-[53], the Court considered the principles to be applied where application is made for an extension of time to appeal in a case such as this. This approach will be adopted in determining the present application.

12As the s.6(3) question ought be addressed, it is appropriate to refer to the circumstances of the offence, the Applicant's subjective circumstances and factors relevant to the question of sentence.

The Applicant's Offence

13The sentencing Judge made findings of fact by reference to evidence adduced at the trial. No challenge has been made to those findings of fact from which the following account is drawn. 

14In December 2005, the Applicant (then aged 42 years) was living alone in rented accommodation at 90 Mount Hay Road, Leura.

15At that time, the victim was working as an escort providing sexual services in the Leura and Katoomba areas. She advertised her services by placing her working name and a mobile telephone number in a local newspaper, the ""Blue Mountains Gazette"".

16At about 10.30 am on 7 December 2005, the Applicant telephoned the victim and arranged to meet her at 71 Mount Hay Road, Leura at 7.00 pm that day. He told her that his name was ""Michael"". He used his own mobile phone to make this call. 

17The property at 71 Mount Hay Road, Leura was owned by other persons, who did not usually live there, but used the property as a weekender. They were not at the property on 7 December 2005.

18At about 7.00 pm on 7 December 2005, the victim arrived at the house at 71 Mount Hay Road, Leura. The house is situated in a relatively secluded location. She was met at the door by the Applicant. She noticed that the Applicant was wearing what she assumed to be work clothes, with ""some sort of tool"" hanging from his belt area. 

19The Applicant led the victim into the house and, according to the victim, there was some small talk. She declined his offer of a drink. 

20According to the evidence of the victim, clearly accepted by the jury and the sentencing Judge, she said to the Applicant, ""Are you just staying here?"" and he replied, ""Something like that"". The victim said, ""Well I will just go where you'd like me to be, I'll follow you"" and the Applicant said, ""Well we'll go into the big bedroom then"".

21The victim commenced to walk in the direction of the bedroom with the Applicant behind her. When about half way across the lounge room, she felt an ""incredibly hard blow to the back of [my] head"". The victim said that she was struck ""about two or three hits"". She turned and almost fell over, saying to the Applicant, ""What are you doing? Stop"". She kept saying, ""Please stop"". 

22The victim stated that when she turned and looked at the Applicant's face, ""It was just absolutely, just enraged, just full of, just absolute rage and I looked at his eyes and when I spoke to him he seemed to stop suddenly and then he said, 'Oh sorry, I must have had a flashback'"".

23The victim did not understand what he meant. She was feeling dizzy with ""a loud ringing in the ears"". The victim then noticed ""lots of blood"" and put her hand up and touched her head and realised that her ""hair was sopping"" with blood. The victim said to the Applicant, ""Oh I'm bleeding ... please help me"".

24The Applicant left the house. He disposed of the weapon, which was never located by police. The victim had difficulty finding a door that she could open. She eventually climbed out of a broken window at the back of the property. She made her way to the street and flagged down a passing driver, who observed that she was bleeding from the head and was very distressed. He took her to Katoomba Hospital where she was seen in the Emergency Department.

25The victim received three bruises to the head - a three-to-four centimetre occipital bruise with a three centimetre laceration requiring three stitches, a 1.5 x 1.5 centimetre bruise behind her right ear, with a third bruise and a one centimetre laceration requiring a stitch. The victim also received bruising to her right shoulder blade area and to two fingers of her left hand. She was discharged from hospital after four hours. 

26Investigating police interviewed the Applicant on two occasions. On 23 February 2006, he participated voluntarily in an interview and on 15 March 2006, he was arrested and agreed after caution to participate in an interview. The Applicant made a number of references to a poor memory, memory loss, blackout periods and said on a number of occasions that he ""could not recall"" going to 71 Mount Hay Road, Leura or committing the offence.

27On 8 March 2006, the victim selected the Applicant from a photographic line up and identified him as her attacker.

28The Applicant remained in custody following his arrest on 15 March 2006 until his release on conditional bail on 8 June 2006. He remained on conditional bail until sentence on 23 June 2009. 

29The Applicant was convicted at trial. He did not give evidence at the trial. It appears that the issue at trial was whether the Applicant was the assailant. It is unsurprising that the jury was satisfied that the Applicant attacked the victim given, amongst other evidence, the fact that he had used his own mobile phone to call on the morning of the crime. No medical evidence was adduced at trial concerning the Applicant or any proclivity on his part to experience blackouts, or how that would affect his criminal liability for this offence. 

Impact of the Offence Upon the Victim

30A victim impact statement was tendered at the sentencing hearing, together with medical and psychological reports concerning the effects of the offence upon the victim. 

31The sentencing Judge observed that ""on any view the victim found the experience an extremely frightening one, quite apart from her physical injuries"" and that ""she has suffered considerable psychological damage as a result"", although the Crown conceded ""that some of her psychological state at the present time can be attributed to past events other than the offender's behaviour on the day in question"" (ROS4-5).

32After referring to the psychological report, the sentencing Judge concluded that the victim's ""psychological condition of chronic PTSD and anxiety and depression is jointly the result of her previous sexual abuse throughout her early childhood ... and also of the attack perpetrated by the accused upon her"" (ROS6). 

33His Honour concluded that the attack played ""a considerable causal role in the ongoing PTSD but it is not the sole cause of it"", and that these matters were to be taken into account on sentence ""when determining the degree of harm, both physical and psychological, which the victim suffered as a result of the offence"" (ROS6).

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

34The Applicant was 42 years of age at the time of the offence and 46 years of age at the time of sentence. He is now 50 years' old. 

35The Applicant's criminal antecedents were limited to two traffic matters and the sentencing Judge regarded him as a person with no prior criminal history. 

36A presentence report was made available to the sentencing Judge. The Applicant informed the author of this report that he had two children from different relationships, but that he had no contact with either child.

37The Applicant had worked on and off as a labourer over the years. When interviewed in May 2009 for the purpose of the presentence report, the Applicant was unemployed and in receipt of Centrelink benefits.

38According to the presentence report, the Applicant was reluctant to divulge personal details. He maintained his innocence to the author of the report, although he acknowledged that he had no recollection of the events. 

39A reference was tendered at the sentencing hearing from Ian McWolfe, who had apparently given character evidence for the Applicant at his trial. Mr McWolfe had known the Applicant for over 15 years in the context of bushwalking and canyoning, and stated that the Applicant performed volunteer search and rescue duties from time to time.

40Also tendered at the sentencing hearing was a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist, dated 30 April 2008. Dr Allnutt had examined the Applicant a year before his trial. He had arranged for the Applicant to return for a further appointment on 1 July 2008, but the Applicant did not attend. Accordingly, Dr Allnutt's report was based upon a single evaluation conducted on 11 April 2008.

41The Applicant told Dr Allnutt that he had been taking Efexor for depression for a year, commencing after his arrest. 

42The Applicant told Dr Allnutt that he had first seen a psychiatrist some years before, in the context of a Family Court matter, and was assessed as normal. He denied any family history of mental illness.

43The Applicant informed Dr Allnutt that he had been in two relationships, the last relationship being in about 2000. The Applicant said he had lost interest in relationships because he was looking for the right person.

44Dr Allnutt noted that the Applicant had told police that he had periods of blackouts. The Applicant conceded to Dr Allnutt that he might have committed the offence. He said that he had experienced probably less than five periods of blackouts of a similar nature in the past, and he attributed them to stress and lack of sleep.

45Dr Allnutt noted that the Applicant believed that there was ""a conspiracy by police to have him arrested, that the police have broken into his house and stolen his property and that the entire arrest was a 'set up'"". Having regard to the evidence, whilst Dr Allnutt could not definitively rule out the presence of a delusional disorder, he believed (based on the information provided) that it was, on balance, unlikely.

46Dr Allnutt considered the Applicant fit to stand trial. As the Applicant stated that he had a poor memory for the alleged offence, Dr Allnutt noted that it was difficult to offer any significant opinion with regard to the relationship between his psychological state and the alleged offence. Although the Applicant stated that he experienced blackouts, Dr Allnutt noted that he had been unable to find an underlying cause for them. 

47As mentioned earlier, the Applicant failed to attend a follow-up evaluation with Dr Allnutt on 1 July 2008. 

48There is no evidence that any further medical or psychiatric evaluation was undertaken. No updated report from Dr Allnutt, or any other medical practitioner, was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The sentencing Judge was left with the victim's description of the offence (and what that may indicate about the Applicant's state), the Applicant's claim of experiencing blackouts and Dr Allnutt's understandably qualified views, not assisted by the Applicant's failure to attend for further evaluation.

Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge

49The sentencing Judge accepted a Crown submission that, at the time of the attack, the victim was alone in a secluded location with the Applicant in circumstances where she found it difficult to escape and seek assistance for her injuries, and that after the attack, the Applicant left the victim alone in the premises without knowing whether she was seriously injured or not. The victim had clear injuries to the head, causing blood flow, and she pleaded with the Applicant to help her, with his response being to depart the premises (ROS10). 

50However, his Honour considered that the Applicant's motives in leaving the scene were mixed and not particularly premeditated, resulting from a degree of panic, but that this did not alter the fact that he left a seriously injured person without assistance, rather than calling for help (ROS11). 

51His Honour said that ""but for the question of possible blackout, I would have regarded the offending as mid range, having regard to the extent of the psychological and physical damage to the victim, the latter being much more significant than the former"" (ROS14-15).

52His Honour concluded that, ""The offence was not entirely premeditated, though there was planning to some degree because of its location, so that the proper finding is one of limited planning"" (ROS18-19).

53His Honour approached the use of the standard non-parole period in the following way (ROS18-19):

""I indicated to the Crown and the defence that it was my intention so to find, and therefore because of that fact, alongside the other circumstances of the offence, as set out above, to find that the offence fell slightly though not far below the midrange for offences of its type, from the point of view of objective criminality. I so find. I indicated that putting against that finding the offender's prior lack of criminal antecedents, and the rest of his subjective case, it seemed to me that the standard non-parole period should not be imposed.""

54The sentencing Judge was ""left in a situation of uncertainty as to whether the offence is in character or out of character"" (ROS15). 

55With respect to the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and risk of reoffending, his Honour said that he could not ""confidently conclude on the balance of probabilities that the offender does have good prospects of rehabilitation and not reoffending"" so that a finding was made that the Applicant's prospects in both respects were ""moderate, depending on the outcome of such programs as he is subjected to, both in prison and hopefully at the direction of the Probation and Parole Service during his parole"" (ROS19).

56A finding of special circumstances was made upon the basis that this would be the Applicant's first time in custody and on the increased need for support and assistance from others when he leaves custody, both to reintegrate into society and to obtain employment (ROS16).

Muldrock Error is Conceded

57The Crown concedes that Muldrock error has been demonstrated in this case. 

58It may be accepted that his Honour adopted a two-stage approach to sentencing, in accordance with the principles then applicable to sentence for a standard non-parole period offence after trial. 

59It is appropriate then to move to the question whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of determining whether an extension of time to appeal should be granted in this case. 

Should the Court Grant an Extension of Time in this Case?

60If the present application had been brought in time then, once error had been demonstrated, it would be necessary for the Court to consider whether the error was material and, if it was, whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in accordance with the principles in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284. 

61The Court re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles, with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which s.6(3) provides, by reference to evidence placed before this Court on appeal: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at 176-178 [119]-[124]; Baxter v R at 287 [17]-[19]. 

62An affidavit of the Applicant affirmed 19 September 2013 was read in the Applicant's case. Given the point that has been reached on this application, it is appropriate to have regard to it. In that affidavit, the Applicant recounts his custodial experience and progress which has reached the point where he is allowed weekend leave. No doubt this is related to the fact that his non-parole period will expire in the not-too-distant future, on 29 March 2014. It is fair to observe that the Applicant has progressed in a satisfactory way whilst in custody.

63There is one aspect, however, which calls for specific comment. It will be recalled that the sentencing Judge (at [55] above) described the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and not reoffending as being moderate, depending on the outcome of custodial programs and any programs in which he was involved following his release on parole. 

64The Applicant's affidavit contains the only evidence with respect to programs which he had undertaken in custody. The Applicant stated that he ""had a few sessions with the resident psychologist, who taught me a really good relaxation exercise"". He states that he also undertook the CALM program which he found ""useful in parts"". The Applicant observed that some of the exercises reminded him of the counselling he ""had on the outside voluntarily before [he] was sentenced"". I will return to this topic.

65The offence is a most disturbing one. The Applicant arranged for the victim, a sex worker, to attend unoccupied premises. When the victim did so, for no apparent reason, the Applicant attacked her from behind with an implement in a cowardly fashion. Several blows were struck to the victim's head and, from her injuries, to her shoulder and hand as well. The blows were struck with sufficient force to cause injuries which the jury found constituted grievous bodily harm. The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant struck the victim in this way with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 

66The observations made by the victim immediately after the attack suggest that the Applicant was in a state of rage, which subsided before he fled the scene. 

67The Applicant did nothing to assist the victim, who remained obviously injured in unoccupied premises. The victim was left to her own devices to leave the premises and to reach the street where, fortunately, a stranger assisted by taking her to the hospital. 

68The Applicant's immediate departure from the premises, leaving the clearly injured victim alone with no apparent means of assistance, may properly be regarded as circumstances of aggravation of the offence: Director of Public Prosecutions v England [1999] 2 VR 258 at 263-264 [18]; R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].

69It was appropriate for the sentencing Judge to adopt a guarded and qualified approach to an assessment of the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and his risk of reoffending. 

70This was a grave offence of violence committed against a woman whom the Applicant caused to be alone in the premises. An attack upon a sex worker who is vulnerable, as a result of attending a private dwelling at the request of the offender, constitutes a crime of very considerable gravity: Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229 at [8], [155]-[169].

71There was no medical evidence to support the Applicant's claim of blackouts, and this continues to be the case. The only medical evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing was the report of Dr Allnutt dated 30 April 2008, to which reference has been made. Dr Allnutt wished to see the Applicant again to allow a complete assessment of him at a time well in advance of trial, but the Applicant failed to attend the appointment. 

72The Applicant informed Dr Allnutt that there was a conspiracy on the part of the police to charge him with this offence, a further disturbing scenario in assessing the reliability of the Applicant and the safety of the community, in particular with respect to women. In considering the risk of reoffending, and the question of future dangerousness, a sentencing court may have regard to the circumstances of the offence itself, and what the offence may indicate concerning future conduct of the offender: Potts v R at [168].

73It is the case that the Applicant has no significant criminal history. It is also the position that he was on conditional bail for an extended period between 2006 and 2009, without any apparent problem manifesting itself. The character evidence from Mr McWolfe provided some general support, as well, for the Applicant with respect to his conduct in the community. In addition, it seems that the Applicant's conduct in custody has not manifested any signs of violence. Of course, to the extent that this offence suggests that the Applicant has a problem with women, then his interaction with women whilst in custody has been limited for obvious reasons. 

74The counselling and programs undertaken by the Applicant in custody appear to have been quite limited. It would be hoped, given the circumstances of the offence, that some custodial program may yet be utilised, as well as post-release counselling and assistance being made available to the Applicant to assist the protection of the community upon his release.

75As the sentencing Judge found, there have been significant adverse consequences for the victim in this case in both a physical and psychological sense. The evidence before the sentencing court indicated that the attack had undermined her confidence in many aspects of life. 

76Given the nature of the offence, considerations of personal deterrence and general deterrence remain very significant on sentence. 

77The Applicant had a very limited criminal history which was taken into account appropriately by the sentencing Judge. However, the offence is a serious one, committed in disturbing circumstances, where there are significant outstanding issues with respect to the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and his risk of reoffending when he returns to the community.

78I do not consider that the Applicant's reliance upon sentencing statistics for s.33 offences provides any real assistance on this application: Lang v R [2013] NSWCCA 29 at [25]-[27].

79In Duncombe v R [2013] NSWCCA 271 at [49]-[53], this Court noted the wide gap between the two guideposts constituted by the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period for offences under s.33(1) Crimes Act 1900. The Court said at [53]:

""Despite that wide gap, it is, of course, necessary for a sentencing court to have regard, and give appropriate weight, to both periods. Undue focus on the standard non-parole period may serve to distract from the proper role of the maximum penalty on sentence."" 


80In my view, a sentence comprising a non-parole period of five years with a balance of term of three years for this offence remains appropriate, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, and keeping in mind the relevant statutory guideposts and principles of sentencing, including the need for specific and general deterrence. This view has been reached having regard to all the evidence before this Court at the hearing of this application.

81I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law for the offence committed by the Applicant, having considered matters relevant to s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.



Conclusion and Order

82The Applicant has not demonstrated a proper basis upon which this Court should intervene. In these circumstances, there is no question of substantial injustice occurring if the sentence imposed upon the Applicant remains in place.

83I propose that the application for extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence be refused.

84LATHAM J: I agree with Johnson J.

2762741,AG v R [2013] NSWCCA 264,"Judgment1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J and the orders which he proposes.
2JOHNSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
3BELLEW J: On 11 June 2009 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing the following counts:(i)between 20 August 2008 and 15 September 2008 attempted to have sexual intercourse with RG, a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 6 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 66B) (count 1);
(ii)between 15 September 2008 and 17 October 2008 had sexual intercourse with RG, a child then under the age of 10 years namely 6 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 66A) (count 2);
(iii)between 12 October 2008 and 10 October 2008 assaulted AG and immediately at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on AG, a child under 10 years, namely 4 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2) (count 3)).
4The applicable maximum penalties are as follows:
(i)as to count 1, 25 years imprisonment;
(ii)as to count 2, 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole of 15 years; 
(iii)as to count 3, 10 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 8 years.
5The applicant was sentenced as follows:
(i)as to count 1, a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 years commencing 17 October 2008 and expiring on 16 October 2014;
(ii)as to count 2, a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing 17 October 2012 and expiring on 16 April 2019, with an additional term of 3 years; 
(iii)as to count 3, a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 17 October 2011 and expiring on 16 April 2016, with an additional term of 1 year and 6 months.  
6The total sentence was one of 13 years and 6 months imprisonment, comprising a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment and an additional term of 3 years.  The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 16 April 2019. 
7The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  The background to that application is set out in an affidavit of the applicant of 18 September 2013, along with an affidavit of Lauren Hrouda, solicitor, of 18 September 2013.  In summary, the applicant did not lodge an appeal against the sentence imposed upon him because he was advised by his then legal representative that there was no utility in doing so, and that he would ""get more time if he appealed"".  In early 2013 he conferred with a representative of Legal Aid NSW who advised him that there may be merit in an appeal.  
8Ms Hrouda has deposed to the fact that she received a copy of the remarks on sentence in early 2013 to consider whether there was merit in an application for leave to appeal against sentence due to a ""Muldrock type error"" (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39).  In Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 this Court explained in detail the background to, and the general nature of, so-called ""Muldrock errors"".  
9Ms Hrouda conferred with the applicant, further documentation was obtained, and counsel was briefed.  There appears to have been some delay in obtaining (inter alia) a transcript of the sentence proceedings, although that delay was not the fault of Ms Hrouda or the applicant.  A Notice of application for leave to appeal was eventually filed on 28 June 2013.
10The Crown has opposed the grant of an extension of time.
THE FACTS11The following summary is taken from the remarks of the sentencing judge.Count 112The victim RG was the daughter of the applicant.  At the time of the offending she was 6 years old and developmentally delayed, both physically and mentally.  
13At some time between 20 August 2008 and 15 September 2008 the applicant and his former partner collected RG from her grandmother's house and took her back to their house for a visit. On arriving at the house the applicant told his partner that he was taking RG into the bedroom.  
14The applicant's partner then walked into the bedroom where the applicant had taken RG.  She saw RG lying down on her back on the bed, with her knees bent and her legs parted.  She was wearing a shirt but was naked below the waist.  The applicant was kneeling between her legs and was also naked from the waist down. His penis was exposed and erect.  The applicant then attempted to place his erect penis inside the victim's vagina. 
15The applicant's partner told the applicant to stop.  While the applicant was attempting to penetrate RG, she was trying to wriggle away from the applicant and was asking the applicant's partner to help her.  The applicant's partner told the applicant to stop and after about five minutes, without having penetrated the victim's vagina, the applicant stopped and left the room.  
Count 216On 17 October 2008, a case worker from the Department of Community Services was contacted and asked to attend the school at which RG attended.  On that occasion RG reported that the applicant had engaged in sexual intercourse with her at her home.  She later confirmed this complaint in a recorded interview with police.
Count 317The victim AG was also the daughter of the applicant.  At the time of the offending she was 4 years of age and lived with the applicant, his partner, and her younger sister who was then 20 months old.  Like RG, AG was also developmentally delayed, both physically and mentally.
18On the occasion of the offending, which was between 1 and 10 October 2008, AG was at home.  The applicant informed his partner that he was going to bathe AG.  The applicant's partner later heard AG crying.  She entered the bathroom and saw the applicant and AG naked in the bath.  The applicant was kneeling in the bath and holding AG in a standing position, rubbing his erect penis up and down between her legs, which he was holding tightly together.  The applicant's partner called upon the applicant to stop but he would not do so.  He continued to rub his penis between AG's legs before ejaculating between them.  When the applicant's partner asked the applicant why he acted as he did, he replied that AG had been ""mucking up"".
The findings of the sentencing judge19His Honour found (at ROS 5) that the behaviour of the applicant was both deliberate and calculated but that at the same time, the offending was opportunistic to some degree (at ROS 10).  He had particular regard to the age of the victims, and concluded (at ROS 9) that the applicant viewed his own children as sexual objects and as a source of sexual gratification.  
20In terms of the objective gravity of the offending, his Honour described it (at ROS 9) as ""particularly heinous"".  He found the offending in counts 1 and 2 to be within the mid range of objective seriousness, and the offending in count 3 to be ""just under the worse (sic) category, having regard to the nature of the activity, the persistence, the fact of ejaculation and the age of the child"".  His Honour also found (again at ROS 9) that the common denominator to the entirety of the offending was a gross breach of trust by the applicant, who was a person who was supposed to be a protector of the two victims.
THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL21Ground 1 - His Honour erred in the way the applicable standard non-parole period was taken into account in connection with counts 2 and 3
The findings of the sentencing judge22As previously noted, counts 2 and 3 carried standard non-parole periods of 15 years and 8 years respectively.  In reference to the standard non-parole periods his Honour said (at ROS 11):
""Now two of the offences attract a standard non-parole period and I must give reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period and the primary reason is the plea, and second reason is, the degree of functioning even not withstanding that I still found it to be within the mid range. And the third reason is, I do propose to find special circumstances in relation to the final sentence I impose. Now I appreciate that nevertheless the standard non parole period remains as a guide, as a general guide along with the maximum sentence and I am mindful not to oscillate around it, having decided to depart from it. I am mindful of the authorities that say I should not oscillate around the non-parole period.""
The submissions of the parties23It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had adopted a two stage approach to sentencing contrary to the decision in Muldrock.  In particular, it was submitted that his Honour had given primary, or perhaps even determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period, as opposed to adopting a process of instinctive synthesis (as to which see Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 per McHugh J at [51]).  This, it was submitted, was evident from his Honour's reference to being required to give reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period.    
24Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that in determining whether his Honour had erred, it was necessary to consider the entirety of the sentencing remarks and that to proceed on the basis of considering isolated passages was not the correct approach.  However counsel submitted that viewed as a whole, his Honour's observations pointed to the adoption of a two stage approach to sentencing. 25The Crown submitted that there had been no error, and stressed that it was the substance, rather than the form, of the reasons of the sentencing judge which were required to be assessed. 
26To the extent that the applicant relied on the sentencing judge's reference to ""departing from"" the standard non-parole period as being indicative of the adoption of a two-stage process of sentencing, the Crown submitted that his Honour was simply adopting that phrase to convey his reasons for imposing a sentence different from the standard non-parole period.  It was further submitted that on a fair and complete reading of his Honour's reasons, it was apparent that a process of instinctive synthesis had been followed, and that his Honour had taken into account all relevant factors before recording the reasons for imposing a sentence different to the standard non-parole period in each case.
27The Crown also placed reliance upon the sentencing judge's reference to the standard non-parole period remaining as a ""general guide along with the maximum penalty"".   It was submitted that the adoption of such a description was at odds with a conclusion that the standard non-parole period had been given primary or determinative significance.
Consideration and conclusion28Taken in isolation, his Honour's reference to the fact that counts 2 and 3 attracted a standard non-parole period, immediately followed by his Honour's reference to the necessity to give reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, might be indicative of the application of a two stage process of sentencing.  Such a process is clearly impermissible in light of the decision in Muldrock.  However, confining the examination of his Honour's reasons to an isolated passage is not the correct approach.  Both parties acknowledged that in determining this ground, it is necessary to read the reasons of the sentencing judge as a whole (see Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30] citing Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [2] and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [43]).  
29When the reasons are read as a whole, I am not satisfied that his Honour's approach was erroneous.  Prior to the passage set out at [21] above, his Honour had considered the various mitigating and aggravating factors.  In doing so, he made express reference to the circumstances of the offending, the applicant's personal circumstances, the applicant's subjective features and the matters of aggravation.  A reading of those passages of his Honour's reasons tends against a conclusion that his Honour adopted a two stage process of sentencing, in which he regarded the standard non-parole period as a fixed and rigid starting point.  In my view, it points to a process of instinctive synthesis having been adopted, in which all relevant matters were identified and taken into account, and a judgment reached as to the appropriate sentence.
30I am fortified in that view by his Honour's reference to the standard non-parole period being (along with the maximum penalty) a ""general guide"", and by his reference to the need not to ""oscillate around"" the standard non-parole period.  Such references, when read as part of the sentencing remarks as a whole, run contrary to the proposition that the standard non-parole period was used in some fixed, rigid or otherwise impermissible way (see Aslett v R [2012] NSWCCA 235 at [35]).  
31For these reasons, this ground is not made out.  
Ground 2 - His Honour failed to apply the principles relevant to sentencing intellectually disabled offendersThe evidence on sentence32Dr Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, examined the applicant and provided a report of 8 May 2009 which was tendered on sentence.  He diagnosed the applicant as having a psychosexual disturbance in respect of which he said (at p. 5):
""This man has acted in an inappropriate sexual way toward two of his children. Details of the offending behaviour are noted in the police fact sheet. (The applicant) either could not or found it difficult to provide a history relating to the offending behaviour. Having examined him only once I am not in a position to indicate to you or the court the extent of his sexual difficulties, but it would appear that his level of insight into the inappropriateness of his behaviour and its wrongness is likely to be compromised. I think that is occurring because of his intellectual problems.""
33Significantly, Dr Westmore also concluded (at p. 6 of his report) that the applicant was mentally retarded.  He estimated that the degree of such retardation was ""mild but possibly closer to the moderate range"".  He described the applicant's level of functioning as being ""in the lower range"" as a consequence of his retardation.
34Having arrived at these diagnoses, Dr Westmore said (at p. 6 of his report):
""He has a limited employment history and he has worked on at least two occasions in services which support intellectually disadvantaged people.  He said he can write his name and date of birth, but otherwise he cannot read or write.   He has had one extended relationship with the mother of his three children.  They were together for seven years.  He has three daughters from that relationship and two of those children are the victims in this matter.
(He) appears to understand he has some problems with controlling his sexual behaviour, he talked about losing control.  He denies having sexual fantasies involving prepubescent children however, although that history is obviously counteracted by the nature of the matters now before the court.  
I am not able to say that he suffers from the condition paedophilia, but his actions were of that type. He expressed a willingness, even a keenness, to attend a sex offenders' program and I saw that as being a positive aspect of his presentation.  To what extent he will be able to learn about appropriate sexual behaviour is unclear.  He should be formally tested by a neuropsychologist and that is likely to occur as part of his overall assessment at the sex offenders' program"".
35In terms of the risk of re-offending, Dr Westmore said (at p. 7 of his report):
""His risks of reoffending will be better understood after he has completed an appropriate sex offenders' program, much will depend on the level and insight and understanding he has about the inappropriateness of his behaviour towards his daughters and he needs to achieve a greater understanding about the harm he could have done to them, both physically and  psychologically, by his actions.
...
At this stage his prognosis looks uncertain but I am not in a position to say that his prognosis is either good or poor based on the current assessment.""
36A pre-sentence report dated 9 March 2009 was also before the court.  Under the heading ""Attitude to the offences"" (at page 2) the author of the pre-sentence report said:
""(The applicant) agreed with the police facts and did not dispute the findings of the court. He admitted guilt for his offending, describing his behaviour as ""stupid"". When pressed, he stated that he has had sexual feeling towards his daughters for sometime, and alluded to the fact that he has struggled with this issue for many years. The applicant did appear to have some level of insight into the wrongfulness of his behaviour; however he seemed to not fully understand the impact of his offence on his victims. He did identify the need for some form of professional intervention in relation to his offending behaviour and although this is encouraging, it is doubtful whether the applicant fully comprehends the inappropriateness of having sexual desires towards his daughters at this point.""
37In summary, the author of the pre-sentence report said (at page 3):
""(The applicant) appears to have a history of sexual based offending. He presents as having unresolved mental health issues, and would no doubt benefit from a comprehensive Forensic Psychological assessment.  (The applicant) appears to struggle with thoughts about sexual offending against minors, and it is the view of this service that (the applicant) would benefit from participation in a significant and intensive offence targeted program. It is a significant concern to this service that the applicant has no post release support in the community, given that he is estranged form (sic) his entire family.""
38The fact that the applicant is estranged from his family would appear to be supported by the history that he gave Dr Westmore that he receives no visits in custody. The findings of the sentencing judge39His Honour referred to the report of Dr Westmore (commencing at ROS 6) in the following terms: 
""There is a psychiatric report from Dr Westmore, which is dated 8 May 2009.  I have paid careful attention to the psychiatric report, but it does not answer all the unanswered questions.  It does set out in some detail, the applicant's background, he is twenty-eight and he is receiving a disability support pension and he has received that pension since 1997. He explained to the psychiatrist he was getting the pension for reading and writing and a few other things. The psychiatrist concludes, which seems to be common ground, that he has what the psychiatrist calls compromised intelligence and there are obvious difficulties with his communication skills.
When the details of the offences were discussed with him, on one occasion he said ""I don't really know"" when asked why he engaged in such conduct. He said ""I should've stopped well beforehand and got help, like I was going to."" He said ""I was trying to keep myself under control as much as possible"" - not much control I would comment. ""I should have gone to get help like I said to me missus in the first place, it's just something you're not supposed to do"" - on this occasion showing some rare insight into his behaviour.
He has had two significant relationships, the last one being with the partner ... the mother of his three children. He was asked about sexual fantasies and he said ""I've only done it once or twice, I've tried to keep my mind away from all that stuff."" And he was asked more directly, whether he had sexual fantasies or thoughts about children and he said ""No and gaol has made me think a lot.""
The personal history demonstrates that he received some special education classes and there was some sexual contact with an older boy, which does not seem to have any particular significance here. And he cannot read or write and he left school in Year 8.
In terms of the mental state examination, it appears that he is not suffering from any major depressive illness. He has no psychotic symptoms or none were identified and he is in the mild to moderate range of mental retardation. The psychiatrist is not in a position to indicate to the court the extent of his sexual difficulties, I suppose that is difficult when he denied to the psychiatrist the particular fantasies about children. He says it would appear that his level of insight into the inappropriateness of his behaviour and the wrongfulness is likely to have been compromised. And again, the psychiatrist concluded that he denies sexual fantasies involving pre pubescent children, although that history is obviously counteracted by the nature of the matters before the court. The doctor concludes, ""I am unable to say he suffers from the condition paedophilia but his actions were of that type.""
Well one could comment here, if this applicant's not a paedophile, who is, but I do not think the particular label matters that much because he acts as a paedophile, when he gratifies himself on children of tender years and whether the psychiatrist has given him the label or not, he certainly acts in the manner of a paedophile. At this stage according to the psychiatrist, his prognosis looks uncertain and he is not in a position to say that it is either good or poor, based on the current assessment. Well that is particularly unhelpful"".
40Without identifying which part(s) of Dr Westmore's opinions he accepted, and which he rejected, his Honour then turned to consider the pre-sentence report and said (commencing at ROS 7):
""The pre-sentence report does throw a bit of further light and the pre-sentence report is a report dated 9 March 2009. And again it details much of the history that which I have already talked about and I will not repeat it. It confirms the fact that the applicant is on a disability pension, et cetera, and it does make reference to a Corrective Services State Wide Disability Service Report, where it was noted that the results suggest significant impairment in verbal skills which may result from hearing impairment and/or other causes.
In relation to the attitude to the offence it is noted that the applicant described his behaviour as stupid, well I would comment that it was much more than stupid. When pressed he stated he had sexual feelings towards his daughters for some time. And he struggled with the issue for many years, he did appear to have some level of insight into the wrongfulness of his behaviour. However, he seemed not to fully understand the impact of the offences on the victims. And it notes that, ""It is doubtful whether the applicant fully comprehends the inappropriateness of having sexual desires towards his daughters at this point."" It comments that he could reasonably be considered a risk to the community. Well that is probably axiomatic. He has no support in the community. There is no post release support in the community because he has become estranged from his family"".
41His Honour then reached the following conclusion as to the effect of the applicant's mental illness on sentence (at ROS 8):
""..... I do find that the level of intellectual functioning does diminish the objective gravity, at least to some extent and it does moderate the requirement for general deterrence to some extent. But having said that, I need to acknowledge immediately that there are countervailing considerations and that is, because of the applicant's intellectual functioning, he remains a danger to the community and the community needs protection from him and children of tender years need protection from him and there is nothing in the evidence that enables me to conclude he could have the discipline to not offend in the way he has already offended"".
The submissions of the parties42Counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant's level of mental retardation was properly described as ""significant"" in the sense in which that term was used by the High Court in Muldrock.  Indeed, counsel for the applicant submitted that the opinion of Dr Westmore supported the conclusion that the applicant's mental retardation was greater than that of the appellant in Muldrock.  
43Accepting that the applicant was mentally retarded to a significant degree, counsel submitted that his Honour had failed to have proper regard to the fact that:  
(i)the moral culpability of the applicant was greatly reduced;
(ii)the significance of general deterrence, specific deterrence, punishment and the need to make the applicant accountable for his actions were all reduced; and
(iii)the denunciatory purposes of sentencing were of less significance. 
44Counsel submitted that the statements made by the applicant to Dr Westmore, and to the author of the pre-sentence report, about his having sexual feelings towards his daughters were necessarily required to be assessed in the context of someone who had received no appropriate treatment to deal with his sex offending.  Counsel further submitted that the evidence established that the applicant had a compromised understanding of his wrongdoing, which was the result of a combination of his mental retardation and the absence of treatment.  
45Counsel for the applicant also emphasised a number of positive features of the applicant's case.  These included his motivation to undergo treatment, and his lack of history of similar offending.  In view of these matters, counsel submitted that it had not been open to the sentencing judge to find that the applicant remained a danger to the community, and that the community continued to require protection from him.
46The Crown submitted that it was apparent from the remarks on sentence that his Honour was aware of the importance of the applicant's intellectual disability in the sentencing process.  This, it was submitted, was evident from his Honour's reference to the fact that this had operated to generally reduce what would otherwise have been the objective gravity of the offending.
47The Crown further submitted that it was open to the sentencing judge to find, on the balance of probabilities, that there was a risk of reoffending.  It was submitted that such a finding was supported by:
(i)the fact that there were three offences involving two different victims;
(ii)the applicant's admission that the offences were committed in the context of him having had sexual feelings towards his daughters for some time;
(iii)the evidence that there was going to be little or no family support in the community upon the applicant's release; and
(iv)Dr Westmore's opinion that the extent to which the applicant would be able to learn about appropriate sexual behaviour remained unclear.
48In these circumstances, it was submitted that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that it was not reasonably open to his Honour to find that the applicant posed a risk to the community.   
Consideration and conclusion49In Muldrock the High Court observed (at [50]):
""The condition of mental retardation is classified according to its severity as mild, moderate, severe or profound.  Mental retardation is defined by reference to both significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning and significant limitations in adaptive functioning.  Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ or IQ equivalent) of about 70 or below"".
50The Court proceeded to observe (at [51]) that the fact that the appellant in that case had engaged in some paid employment, and the fact that he held a driver's licence, did not detract from an assessment of his level of retardation.  The Court also observed that the appellant, like the applicant in the present case, had been in receipt of a disability support pension.  
51By reference to the judgments of Young CJ and Lush J in R v Mooney (CA (Vic) 21 June 1978 unreported) the High Court cited (at [53]) the principle that general deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality, because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.  In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194, McClellan CJ at CL (at [177] - [178]) considered the principles to be applied when sentencing a mentally ill offender.  Although the decision in De La Rosa was delivered after the present applicant was sentenced, his Honour's judgment reviewed a number of earlier authorities and consolidated the well established principles for which those authorities stood, and which were applicable to the sentencing of the applicant.  Included in those principles was that cited by the High Court in relation to the consideration of general deterrence in the case of a mentally ill offender.
52In the present case, the unchallenged opinions of Dr Westmore included that the applicant had:
(i)a compromised level of insight into the inappropriateness of his behaviour; (ii)an inability to read and write, other than being able to write his name and date of birth; and(iii)an employment history which, in recent times at least, had been limited to working in services supportive of those who are intellectually disadvantaged.
53These, and the various other matters to which Dr Westmore referred, all supported his ultimate opinion that the applicant was at least mildly, if not moderately, mentally retarded.  Counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant's mental retardation was at least the same, if not greater than, that of the applicant in Muldrock.  However such a comparative exercise may not be to the point.  The more important consideration is that the degree of the applicant's retardation was, on any view, significant, and its relevance to sentence obvious.  
54His Honour expressly stated that he had paid ""careful attention"" to the report of Dr Westmore before observing that in his view, it did not ""answer all the unanswered questions"".  He then set out a number of aspects of the report as detailed in [38] above, before considering the pre-sentence report and then reaching the conclusions set out in [40].    He found that the applicant's level of intellectual functioning diminished the objective gravity of the offending ""at least to some extent"" and that it moderated the requirement for general deterrence ""to some extent"" before immediately turning to what he considered to be countervailing considerations, including the fact that the applicant posed a danger to the community.
55Although his Honour made lengthy references to the report of Dr Westmore, and although he stated that he had paid careful attention to its contents, he made only a brief reference to Dr Westmore's opinion as to the applicant's mental retardation.  Although that factor was of obvious importance in determining an appropriate sentence, his Honour's reference to it passed without any further comment or evaluation.  
56The significance of the applicant's mental retardation became even greater in light of Dr Westmore's unchallenged opinion that it had resulted in the likelihood of the applicant having a compromised level of insight into the wrongness of his behaviour.  Clearly, Dr Westmore found some causal connection between the applicant's mental state and his offending.  In these circumstances, the applicant's mental state not only meant that he was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, it also operated to reduce his moral culpability.      
57These matters were, on any view, important considerations in determining the sentence to be imposed.  Apart from his Honour's passing reference in the terms which I have noted, there was no further assessment made of them.  Moreover, to the extent that his Honour gave those matters consideration at all, he did so in somewhat qualified terms, finding that they were relevant ""to some extent"".  Such a finding significantly understated their significance, and was indicative of insufficient weight having been given to them in the sentencing process.  The evidence established that as a mentally retarded adult it was likely that the applicant had a compromised understanding of the wrongdoing of engaging in sexual acts with children. His Honour was required to assess the applicant's criminality in that context.  In my view, the relevance, on the question of sentence, of the applicant's mental retardation was substantially greater than that for which his Honour made allowance.  
58His Honour also described the applicant's offending (at ROS 5) as being ""persistent and deliberate ... notwithstanding the interruption by (his) partner"".   Whilst on an objective view of the offending that description might be prima facie accurate, it failed to take into account the unchallenged evidence of Dr Westmore as to the applicant's compromised level of insight into his offending.  
59For these reasons, his Honour erred in failing to properly apply the principles relevant to the sentencing of an offender who suffers from a mental illness.  In particular, his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's mental retardation in the particular respects to which I have referred.  Those errors were material (see Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at [83] per Latham J). 
60This ground is therefore made out.   
The application to extend time61 In Abdul (supra) this Court said (at [53])
""Accordingly, when considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time"".
62The delay in the present case is substantial, although perhaps not as great as that in some cases examined recently by this Court.  A Victim Impact Statement which was before the sentencing judge set out the emotional effects upon the victim AG, although given her young age this may be a case in which an extension of time would not have any further adverse effect upon her.  An extension of time would, however, offend the principle of finality.  To the extent that the application was brought on the basis of a change in sentencing principles arising from the decision in Muldrock it is also relevant that I have found that no Muldrock error has been made out.  On balance, these various considerations tend against an extension of time being granted. 
63Further, although ground 2 has been made out, an appeal based upon that ground could have been brought at a far earlier time.  That said, the failure to do so is largely explained by the advice which was given to the applicant following the sentence proceedings.  The tenor of that advice was, to say the least, unhelpful.  In light of the conclusions I have reached in respect of ground 2, it was also inaccurate. 
64For the reasons explained in Abdul, because a material error has been established it is necessary to assess the prospects of success of the application for leave to appeal.  In doing so, the Court must consider whether any other sentence is warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s. 6(3)).
Is a lesser sentence warranted in law?Submissions of the parties65Counsel for the applicant acknowledged the seriousness of the applicant's offending, and the fact that it involved a significant breach of trust.  However, it was submitted that the applicant's continuation of his offending in the face of the requests made by his partner to desist was explicable on the basis of his mental retardation, and his lack of insight into his wrongdoing.  In this respect, counsel emphasised the degree of the applicant's mental retardation, and submitted that he was basically illiterate. 
66Counsel also pointed to the applicant's expressed willingness to undertake treatment, and to the opinion of Dr Westmore that this was a positive aspect of the applicant's presentation.  
67Counsel for the applicant acknowledged the importance of the protection of the public.  However she pointed out, with some force in my view, that the applicant had not previously displayed any predatory or similar behaviour, and stressed that he had not yet received any treatment in respect of sex offending.  The essence of those submissions was that appropriate treatment would assist in his rehabilitation. 
68The Crown acknowledged the evidence of the level of the applicant's mental retardation but submitted that properly viewed, the opinion of Dr Westmore fell short of establishing a causal link between that condition and the applicant's offending.  The Crown also stressed the seriousness of the offending, the fact that it involved two separate victims, the applicant's persistence in the face of being told to desist and the serious breach of trust.  
Consideration and conclusion69The Crown's submissions as to the seriousness of the offending are obviously well made.  However, they must be balanced against a number of other matters, the most significant of which is the applicant's mental state which, for the reasons I have already expressed, is significant.  In my view, primarily as a consequence of the failure of the sentencing judge to have proper regard to the applicant's mental state, a lesser sentence is warranted in law.  However in determining the appropriate sentence, the sentencing discretion must be re-exercised afresh, taking into account all relevant considerations.  
70The existence of a causal connection between the applicant's retardation and the offending is an inescapable conclusion from the report of Dr Westmore.  As a consequence, the applicant's moral culpability is significantly reduced and he is not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence.
71Prior to these matters, the applicant was a person of prior good character with no criminal history.  He pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, he is not a recidivist and he has expressed both a willingness and a keenness to engage in appropriate forms of treatment.  
72I have taken into account the contents of the applicant's second affidavit of 18 September 2013 which was admitted without objection on the question of re-sentence.  He has undertaken literacy classes since being in custody, is employed full time in a textile shop and is undertaking a course of study in textiles at TAFE.  All of those matters provide some positive support to his prospects of rehabilitation.
73In particular, the applicant has expressed (consistent with what he told Dr Westmore) a desire to undertake a sex offenders course.  As I have noted, Dr Westmore saw this as a positive aspect of his presentation.  
74Dr Westmore also thought that as part of the applicant's rehabilitation, there was a necessity for him to gain a greater understanding of the inappropriateness of his offending, and the danger he posed to his children.  In this regard, the applicant has deposed in his affidavit to wanting to ""get better"", and has expressed some acknowledgement of the seriousness of his offending.  That evidence goes some way to supporting a conclusion that with appropriate treatment, the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation are likely to be more positive than not.  
75In re-sentencing the applicant in the terms in which I propose, I have had regard to the provisions of s. 54B of the Sentencing Act as amended by Schedule 1[3] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Non-parole Periods) Act NSW 2013 (""the Amendment Act"").  In particular:
(i)I have taken into account the standard non-parole periods applicable to counts 2 and 3 as required by s. 54B(2) (as amended by the Amendment Act);(ii)I have set out above my reasons for the sentences which I would propose be imposed in lieu of those imposed by his Honour at first instance as required by s. 54B(3);(iii)I have indicated the non-parole periods which I consider appropriate in respect of counts 2 and 3 as required by s. 54B(4); and(iv)I have set out above the reasons why I consider those non-parole periods to be appropriate as required by s. 54B(5).ORDERS76For the foregoing reasons, I propose the following orders: 
(i)the application for extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against sentence is granted;(ii)leave to appeal against sentence is granted;(iii)the appeal is allowed;(iv)the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 is quashed, and in lieu thereof a fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years, commencing on 17 October 2008 and expiring on 16 October 2013, is imposed;(v)the sentence imposed in respect of count 2 is quashed, and in lieu thereof a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing on 17 October 2010 and expiring on 16 October 2016, with an additional term of 3 years expiring on 16 October 2019, is imposed;(vi)the sentence imposed in respect of count 3 is quashed, and in lieu thereof a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 17 October 2009, and expiring on 16 October 2013, with an additional term of 12 months expiring on 16 October 2014, is imposed;(vii)the applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 16 October 2016, and his aggregate sentence will expire on 16 October 2019.

2762746,Kim v The Korean Times Pty Ltd & Anor [2013] NSWDC 230,"Judgment
1The plaintiff commenced these proceedings by statement of claim on 15 June 2012 in relation to a publication on 17 June 2011 by the defendants asserted to give rise to the following imputations:
(a)The plaintiff lied about his payment of $9,000 compulsory donation to the Association during the 2010 presidential campaign;
(b)The plaintiff lied to the members of the Association in order to be elected the president of the Association;
(c)The plaintiff committed acts of dishonesty by using the Association's fund for personal gain.
2The proceedings were stood over on 6 July, 3 August and 7 September 2012. The defendants brought an application on 12 September 2012 for these proceedings to be dismissed pursuant to s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and Pt 13 r 13.4 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""), on the basis that these proceedings sought damages against the same defendants in respect of issues that had already been dealt with, namely proceedings 2011/257775. The statement of claim filed in those proceedings, on 10 August 2011, were settled but, according to the judgment of Elkaim SC DCJ of 21 September 2012 dismissing the motion, the imputations were different and the two publications differed in nature, form and intent. The defendants' application was dismissed with costs.
3The defendants then brought an application for consolidation which was heard on 30 November 2012. Orders were made for these proceedings to be heard together. On Monday 15 April 2013 Elkaim SC DCJ revisited his ruling of 30 November 2012 by reason of one of the parties requisitioning a jury. The defendants were directed to file a defence by 5 April 2013 and on 15 April 2013 the defendants were given a ""last opportunity"" to file a defence by Elkaim SC DCJ. 
4These proceedings were listed before me on 14 June 2013. Mr Roest appeared for the first defendant. I extended time for the filing of a defence and made directions about the translation disputes and proposed imputations arguments. I gave a further extension of time to file a defence when these proceedings were next before me on 16 August 2013, when the defendants were represented by Mr Maxwell. 
5No defence was filed and, on 4 October 2013, Elkaim SC DCJ ordered Mr Nam, the second defendant, to pay the costs of the plaintiff, and additionally noted that his solicitor proposed to file a Notice of Ceasing to Act. This Notice has now been filed, and relates to both defendants.
6On 25 October 2013 Elkaim SC DCJ directed the plaintiff to notify the defendants that ""if a Defence is not filed then judgment may be entered for the plaintiff on the next directions hearing date"".
7Following this order, the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to both defendants on 8 November 2013 (who I note are also the defendants in proceedings 2011/88507) advising that if they did not appear and/or no defence is filed by 14 November 2013, ""the court may make orders against you"", including an order for judgment to be entered.
8When these proceedings came before me today, both defendants were called outside the court three times. There was no appearance in either these proceedings or in proceedings 2011/88507.
9The plaintiff seeks an order for judgment to be entered. For the reasons set out in my judgment in proceedings 2011/88507, I am not prepared to do so today. The facts in these proceedings are considerably more compelling than those in proceedings 2011/88507. These proceedings were commenced only in June 2012 and the defendants have actively participated in them. In addition, while these proceedings have been listed 15 times without a defence being filed, that is more a product of the listing system than failures of the defendants to comply.
10Given the number of times that the defendants have failed to file a defence I shall, however, make a peremptory order and relist the matter specially before me in order to ensure that any failure to comply can be monitored.
11The court is to fax a copy of this judgment to the first defendant and to post a copy to the second defendant. If there is no compliance with the peremptory order on the next return date, then the next step would be the entry of judgment and the listing of these proceedings for assessment of damages. The defendants are warned that this really is their last chance to file a defence, or at least to appear and to indicate good reason for non-compliance with such an order. 
Orders
(1)The Korean Times Pty Ltd and Mr Nam called outside Court 13D three times at 9:37am - No appearance.
(2)Mr Joshua Nam called outside Court 13D three times at 9:37am - No appearance.
(3)Grant leave to the plaintiff to file in court correspondence to the defendant.
(4)Noting the continued failure of the defendants in 2011/88507 and the defendant in 2012/188657 to comply with orders to file a defence, or to appear in court, a self-executing order for any defence to be filed by 4:00pm Wednesday 20 November 2013, noting that failure to comply will result in entry of judgment for the plaintiff, with liberty to apply for an assessment hearing on damages.
(5)The plaintiff is to notify The Korean Times Pty Ltd by fax by 5:00pm today of these orders.
(6)Set aside the orders made by Elkaim SC DCJ on 30 November 2012 for these matters to be consolidated or otherwise heard together.
(7)Matter stood over before Gibson DCJ on Thursday 21 November 2013 at 9:30, when if no defence has been filed, judgment will be entered and the plaintiff may apply to the List Judge for a hearing date for assessment of damages.

		29 November 2013",2013-11-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762748,Kim v The Korean Times Pty Ltd & Anor [2013] NSWDC 229,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR: I set out the reasons for the orders I made in these proceedings this morning.
2The plaintiff commenced proceedings by statement of claim filed on 18 March 2011 seeking damages for publication in the Korean Times (Hojuilbo) of an article headed ""Boiling Rage after Approval by the parent Body of Hyang Goon Election"". The imputations pleaded were:
(a)The plaintiff is a person guilty of shameful and illegal actions;
(b)The election of the plaintiff as President of the Association was illegitimate;
(c)The plaintiff as an elected candidate had committed acts of depravity within the organisation;
(d)The plaintiff as a candidate had committed significant illegal actions;
(e)The plaintiff had by his actions damaged the image of the Association; and
(f)The plaintiff had been exposed for his illegitimacy and depraved past.
3""Hyang Goon"" is the Korean Veterans Association. The matter complained of consists of allegations about the plaintiff's conduct as its president, described in colourful metaphor and emotive language.
4Progress since the first return date of 15 April 2011 has been slow. These proceedings have been listed for a total of 31 times for directions, timetables, mediation, challenges foreshadowed to the imputations, claims the translation is inaccurate, and complaints of delay and non-compliance by both sides. 
5The plaintiff revised the statement of claim on 9 and 23 May 2011, but there are no other pleadings. Despite being listed 31 times, on at least some of which directions hearing dates, orders were made for the filing of a defence, the defendants have never done so. Nor have they sought a hearing of any of their asserted objections to the imputations and translation.
6The court has from time to time inquired about the delay. On 12 October 2012 the plaintiff told the court that his attention had been diverted by other litigation between the parties, and the defendants were ordered to file a defence by 7 September 2012. They did not do so, on the basis that the issues of the imputations and translation challenges needed to be determined first. The judge hearing the defamation list noted that ""this is 18th time in list and parties still in dispute re translation of relevant article.""
7In 2012 the plaintiff commenced two other actions for defamation, one against the same newspaper (2012/188657), and the other against an unrelated party. Orders were made on 30 November 2012 for these proceedings to be heard together with proceedings 2012/112659 (in which the defendants to these proceedings were not a party) and 2012/188657 (to which both the defendants in these proceedings were parties), and for the defendants to file and serve their defences by 4 February 2013. Again, the defendants in these proceedings did not do so. 
8The defendant in proceedings 2012/112659 filed a Jury Requisition as well as a defence, and that matter is now ready to take a hearing date. There is no justification for those proceedings being further delayed by the failure of the defendants in these proceedings, namely the Korean Times and Mr Nam (who have similarly failed to file a defence in proceedings 2012/88507) to file a defence but unless the orders of 30 November 2012 are set aside, the proceedings which are ready for hearing will continue to be prevented from proceeding further.
9In an attempt to expedite the filing of a defence, on 15 April 2013 the judge hearing the defamation list gave the defendants a ""last opportunity"" to file a defence. They did not do so. 
10The solicitor for the plaintiff filed a Notice of Ceasing to Act and new solicitors came into the matter. On 14 June and 16 August they sought orders that a defence be filed. No defence was forthcoming and on 4 October 2013 the solicitor for the second defendant advised that he intended to file a Notice of Ceasing to Act. 
11On 25 October 2013 the judge hearing the defamation list directed the plaintiff to inform the defendants in these proceedings, as well as in the 2012 proceedings (2012/188657) that if a defence was not filed in 14 days ""judgment may be entered for the plaintiff on the next directions hearing date"", and the plaintiff was directed to notify the defendants of this order in writing.
12When the matter came before me this morning, there was no appearance for either defendant. No defence has been filed. The solicitor for the plaintiff has tendered letters dated 8 November 2013 to each of the defendant, advising the contents of the orders made on 25 October 2013.
13The plaintiff now seeks an order for judgment. Default judgment is not an appropriate procedure for defamation actions: Altarama Pty Ltd v Forsyth [1981] 1 NSWLR 188. In Altarama, Hunt J indicated that the appropriate step to take, where no defence had been filed, was to seek a peremptory order for the filing of a defence and, if that order was not complied with, to then seek to enter judgment following any failure to comply with this order.
14Delay in any kind of litigation is unacceptable. In Lemoto v Able Technical Pty Ltd (2005) 63 NSWLR 300 at [95], McColl JA warned: ""The days when the suit of Jarndyce v Jarndyce wound its apocryphal way through the pages of Dickens' ""Bleak House"" are long gone - if they ever were."" However, in Fairey v Fairey (No 2) [2000] NSWCA 173 at [51] - [58], the Court of Appeal warned that dismissal of proceedings was an exceptional order. 
15This concern about delay is particularly relevant for defamation actions, where the cost and complexity of the cause of action is considerable. However, despite the enactment of s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), the principles for summary dismissal in relation to defamation proceedings which were applicable before this legislation continue to be cited with approval: Pacanowski v Wakerman [2009] NSWCA 402 at [26] - [28], citing Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 527.
16The interaction of ss 56 and 61(3)(a) Civil Procedure Act and the entitlement of the parties to a fair trial process has been the subject of analysis by Johnson J in Rivera v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWSC 1360 at [82] - [86]. Johnson J stated that the courts should not stand by and permit endless opportunities to a litigant, where reasonable and fair opportunities have been provided in the past to progress the litigation (at [85]), noting the amount of court time that such proceedings take up (at [86]). The delay in that case was, however, ten years, which warranted the making of what his Honour called ""the exceptional order which is sought"" (at [87]) under r 12.7 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""). In addition, the causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff did not include a claim for defamation, where the obligation of a defendant to continue to prosecute the action appears to continue to apply (see the NSW Court of Appeal's endorsement of the test in Hoser v Hartcher in Pacanowski, supra, at [26] - [28]).
17In Hoser v Hartcher  the party guilty of the delay was, like Mr Rivera, also the plaintiff. The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation but then took no further steps for three years. The fact that a plaintiff delays in defamation proceedings is significant because, in addition to the general principle that courts may be more sympathetic to delay by a defendant, particularly in defamation proceedings, where defendants rarely have insurance, delay by a plaintiff in commencing or prosecuting a defamation action may result in reduction of the damages awarded. The principal reason for Mr Hoser's delay was that, during the three year period of his inactivity, he had been convicted and imprisoned for perjury. The defendant took no steps in the case during this period; the action was allowed to lie dormant. When the plaintiff reactivated the case, the defendant sought summary dismissal. Simpson J dismissed the application, on the basis that the defendant's inaction was fatal; it outweighed complaints of prejudice and what Simpson J accepted were the plaintiff's poor prospects of success at the trial.
18The plaintiff in these proceedings has certainly had the matter relisted many times - in fact, these proceedings have been listed 31 times - but not much has happened on these occasions. The plaintiff has been content to seek further timetables without seeking peremptory orders, summary dismissal or other case management orders designed to bring the case to finality. 
19In addition, the defendants have been given inadequate notice of any such application, in that the order made on the previous occasion stated only the court ""may"" enter judgment today. 
20Applying the checklist in Hoser v Hartcher, the plaintiff should not be entitled to the summary striking out of these proceedings today. There is, however, ample basis for the making of a peremptory order for the filing of the defence. The defendants' failure to file defences in accordance with previous timetables, their more recent failure to attend court despite being notified of the court dates and their failure to bring the applications which are the excuse for not complying with these orders are matters which warrant the making of a peremptory order. The defendants have also been warned that, if no defence is filed in accordance with the peremptory order, judgment will be entered when these proceedings are next before the court.
21Whether or not defences are filed, these proceedings should no longer be listed for hearing together, as proceedings 2012/112659 are now ready for hearing. The parties in those proceedings should not be inconvenienced by the dilatory conduct of the defendants in these proceedings.
22I have provided these brief reasons for judgment in order to ensure that the defendants are aware of the seriousness of their situation. The court will fax a copy of this judgment to the Korean Times in order to ensure that those who publish this newspaper are aware that no further excuses for delay will be permitted, and that, if no defence is filed, judgment may very well be entered on the date set out in the orders below when the proceedings have been specially listed for that purpose before me.
Orders
(1)The Korean Times Pty Ltd and Mr Nam called outside Court 13D three times at 9:37am - No appearance.
(2)Mr Joshua Nam called outside Court 13D three times at 9:37am - No appearance.
(3)Grant leave to the plaintiff to file in court correspondence to both defendants.
(4)Noting the continued failure of the defendants in 2011/88507 and the defendant in 2012/188657 to comply with orders to file a defence, or to appear in court, a self-executing order for any defence to be filed by 4:00pm Wednesday 20 November 2013, noting that failure to comply will result in entry of judgment for the plaintiff, with liberty to apply for an assessment hearing on damages.
(5)The plaintiff is to notify The Korean Times Pty Ltd by fax by 5:00pm today of these orders, and to notify Mr Nam by forwarding a letter to him by close of business today.
(6)Set aside the orders made by Elkaim SC DCJ on 30 November 2012 for these matters to be consolidated or otherwise heard together.
(7)Matter stood over before Gibson DCJ on Thursday 21 November 2013 at 9:30, when if no defence has been filed, judgment will be entered and the plaintiff may apply to the List Judge for a hearing date for assessment of damages.

		29 November 2013",2013-11-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762766,"VERSI, Peter v R [2013] NSWCCA 206","Judgment

1BASTEN JA: The applicant, Peter Versi, was convicted by a jury on two counts of sexual misconduct involving his stepdaughter. He seeks leave to appeal against both his convictions and sentences. Leave is required with respect to the convictions because the grounds do not raise questions of law only: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1). For the reasons given by Adams J, there should be a grant of leave with respect to each of the convictions and the sentences. 

2Subject to the following qualifications, the appeals should be dismissed for the reasons given by Adams J.

Listening to tape of summing up
3Senior counsel for the applicant invited the Court to listen to the whole of the sound recording of the summing up, in order to assess grounds 2, 3 and 7, which allege that the directions with respect to coincidence and tendency evidence were confusing and misleading, as was the summing up generally. Adams J has declined the invitation to listen to the whole of the summing up but has acceded to the invitation to listen to those specific portions relating to coincidence and tendency evidence, to which objection was taken by the applicant.

4That approach is a pragmatic response in a case where the specific passages challenged are discrete and of limited duration. Nevertheless, there is a question as to whether as a matter of principle, this Court should accede to such invitations and, if so, in what circumstances.

5It is a matter of common experience that transcripts contain inaccuracies which can readily be identified and corrected by those involved in the proceedings. That fact involves no criticism of the highly competent and diligent transcription service: it is easy to mistake or mishear words where the subject matter is unfamiliar. Further, the quality of the sound recording is quite variable. Given these factors, it is commonplace for the trial judge to correct the transcript of the summing up, after it is made available to the court. However, that does not always occur and did not occur in the present case, possibly because the trial was presided over by an acting judge. As in the case of a transcript of evidence, corrections are made, not to remove infelicities of expression, but to ensure that what is recorded is what was in fact said. If there is a dispute as to what was said and the transcript has not been corrected by the trial judge, it may well be appropriate for the appeal court to listen to the sound recording. However, in the present case a corrected version of the transcript was prepared by the solicitors for the applicant and was provided to this Court without objection from the respondent. This Court should rely upon the corrected version, there being no dispute as its accuracy.

6There are omissions even in the corrected version. In some cases, if the omissions were thought to be of material words, it might be proper for this Court to listen to the recording to form its own view (to the extent possible) as to the missing words. However, if those who were present have been unable to decipher the recording, it would usually be unlikely that this Court would be better able. In the present case, it was not contended that any particular words noted as untranscribable were of critical importance.

7The Court is left in the position where it is being asked to listen to the recording, not to resolve any dispute as to what was said, nor to fill any omission, but to form a view as to whether the jury would have misunderstood or misheard directions which were, in their terms, adequate. That is a course which the Court should adopt only with great caution and when satisfied that some benefit can be obtained. One reason for such caution is that an appellate court cannot be sure that the sound recording will give an accurate impression of that which the jury heard. Factors such as the placement of the microphone will not be known.

8Further, although a judge's summing up is a discrete part of the trial, it is often necessary to consider it in the overall context of the trial, which may include consideration of the evidence and the addresses of the prosecutor and defence counsel. If it were thought desirable to invite the appeal court to listen to the summing up, the practice might extend to inviting the court to listen to other aspects of the trial. There is an issue, however, as to the extent to which it is appropriate to invite an appeal court to place itself, as closely as possible, in the shoes of the jury. When addressing a ground challenging a verdict on the basis that it was unreasonable, or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence, it may be necessary for the appeal court to review the whole of the evidence. Nevertheless, the court must always make allowance (as indeed it must with a judge only trial) for the advantages of being present during the whole of the trial. The appeal court is not to replace the jury for the purposes of reconsidering the case afresh. Its role is more limited.

9Finally, such a request must be approached with caution on a pragmatic basis. A limited request in one case will expand in the next. If trials are video recorded in the future, appeal courts will be invited to watch the video recording rather than listen to the sound recording. The time required to deal with appeals will rapidly exceed the available resources.

10Bearing these factors in mind, I am not persuaded that this is a case in which it is appropriate to accede to the applicant's request to listen to either the whole sound recording of the summing up, or discrete portions. The adequacy of the directions should be assessed on the basis of the agreed transcript.

Coincidence evidence
11The rule with respect to the admissibility of coincidence evidence is formulated in the negative, namely that coincidence evidence is not admissible unless two conditions are satisfied: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 98(1). The first condition is procedural (the giving of notice in writing); the second involves the satisfaction of the court that the evidence has ""significant probative value"". The application of these conditions was not raised by the grounds of appeal concerning the directions as to the use of the evidence. However, the way in which the evidence can be used, if admitted, is identified in s 98(1) in the following terms (simplified to identify the principle), namely the purpose of the proposed tender is to prove ""that a person did a particular act ... on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred ... it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally"". Evidence adduced for that purpose is described in the Evidence Act as ""coincidence evidence"": Dictionary, Pt 1 coincidence evidence. The term covers much of what under general law principles was described as ""propensity"" or ""similar fact"" evidence, although propensity evidence is also covered by what is now ""tendency"" evidence, dealt with in s 97. It is admissible if it has sufficient probative value, despite the fact that (prejudicially) it reveals the commission of some other offence, with which the accused is not charged, with the concomitant danger that the jury may reason improperly from satisfaction that the accused committed the uncharged offence to satisfaction that he was guilty of the offence charged. The term ""coincidence"" is not always apt to describe that which is otherwise improbable. 

12The evidence of the complainant with respect to count 2 was that the applicant asked the complainant to assist him with putting cream on his penis and testicles. The other incident, of which evidence was given by Ms SD1, to whom the applicant was also a stepfather when she was an adolescent, involved him inviting her into the bathroom and requesting her to hold his erect penis ""so that he could fix his hernia"". Her evidence was that when she took hold of his penis he ""proceeded to sort of grind his hips against my hand"".

13The question for the jury was whether the incident with the complainant in fact occurred as she described. As explained in Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 482 (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ):

""The probative value of the evidence lies in the improbability of witnesses giving accounts of happenings having the degree of similarity unless the events occurred.""

14Section 98 provides that ""[e]vidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible"" for the identified purpose unless the conditions already noted are fulfilled. A note to the section provides that ""[o]ne of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding"": needless to say, s 98 is not a proscription of evidence of the event the subject of the charge. It is to be understood as a conditional exclusion of evidence of events involving misconduct by the accused on one or more occasions other than that the subject of the charge. That which is significantly probative of the charge is not the fact of other complaints, but proof that the other events occurred. 

15No doubt there is a sense in which it is true to say that, absent communication between the witnesses, which might give rise to suggestion, collaboration or concoction, it is highly improbable that two individuals would describe separate events involving similar conduct on the part of the accused, unless that conduct had occurred. However, s 98 distinguishes between ""evidence"" and ""events"". It is the improbability that ""the events occurred coincidentally"" (that is without a causal connecting factor, namely the involvement of the accused) which is the focus of the section. It would be artificial to base an exclusionary rule upon the similarity of evidence about one event with the similarity of evidence about another. The section does not, in any event, do that.

16This analysis departs linguistically from that of Adams J below, but not so as to affect the conclusion.

17I agree with Adams J that a direction that the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the allegations made by SD1 may have been unduly favourable to the applicant. It was not necessary for the jury to consider the evidence of the complainant and SD1 independently before considering the cumulative effect. It is possible that the jury might have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the truth of each allegation, considered alone: but if that were so, the jury would have been entitled to consider both together in order to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct the subject of the charge occurred, as described by the complainant. As explained by Gleeson CJ in HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334 at [29], generally ""the law as to standard of proof applies to the elements of the offence, not particular facts."" Again speaking generally, ""the indispensable link case apart, it is ordinarily neither necessary nor appropriate for a trial judge to give separate directions about the standard of proof of uncharged acts"": at [32]. The ""indispensable link"" in the present case was the complainant's evidence as to the subject matter of the charge: the evidence of SD1 formed part of the web of circumstances which rendered it more likely that the complainant's account was truthful and reliable. The evidence of the complainant and SD1 was, in that sense, mutually corroborative.

Opportunity for suggestion, collaboration or concoction
18The probative force of the evidence of the two events depended upon the absence of any extraneous explanation. Evidence of opportunity for communication between the witnesses, occurring before they complained, would give rise to at least a possibility of communication about the events and, if not concoction, unconscious suggestion or moulding of memory. Such evidence would almost invariably be raised on the voir dire, as a basis for rejecting the evidence of the misconduct not the subject of a charge. No such issue was raised at trial, either on a voir dire or before the jury, in the cross-examination of either the complainant or Ms SD1. Nor was it raised on appeal.

19Absence of opportunity for concoction between two witnesses was not an element of the prosecution case against the applicant. Indeed, mere opportunity might not have affected the probative value of the evidence, absent evidence of actual communication about the allegations. There was, accordingly, no error or potential miscarriage arising from the fact that neither party raised the issue at trial. In those circumstances, it could not properly have been raised on appeal: cf Adams J at [135]-[142]. If raised it would have been rejected as misconceived, there being no error to which a response was required. It was not raised and need not be addressed.

Appeal against sentences
20The applicant also sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed for each offence. 

21The less serious offence (count 2) involved an act of indecency with a person under 16 years of age, contrary to the now repealed s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum sentence for that offence was two years imprisonment. The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was a period of six months imprisonment, by way of a fixed term.

22The more serious offence (count 3) was sexual intercourse with a person between 10 years and 16 years of age, whilst under the offender's authority, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act (now repealed). The sentencing judge imposed a period of two years three months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 15 months. The sentence on this count was fixed to commence three months after the first sentence and was thus cumulative upon 50% of the first sentence. The non-parole period for the second sentence constituted 55% of the sentence period for that offence.

23It is not in doubt that the applicant was properly to be sentenced according to the law as it stood at the time of the offences. 

24The only relevant ground of appeal was that, ""[t]he sentence was manifestly excessive and outside the appropriate range"". There were in fact two sentences and the applicant's submissions addressed both, and the element of accumulation.

25The applicant's submissions noted that the complainant was aged 11 or 12 years at the time of the first offence, namely count 2. (She was born on 29 January 1974 and the offence was identified in the indictment as occurring between 15 November 1985 and 22 April 1986: she was thus approximately 12 years of age.) 

26The submissions noted that the conduct was less serious than ""an indecent assault"", referring to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act, as then in force. That was true, however the sentence under s 61E(1) was, relevantly, a maximum term of six years or triple that for the offence charged as count 2. 

27The submissions also noted that counts 2 and 3 involved two discrete occasions and were not a part of an ongoing course of conduct or persistent abuse. That was so, but that consideration tended to support an element of accumulation. 

28Count 3 involved the more serious offence, namely sexual intercourse by digital penetration of the vagina. That was said to have occurred in a period commencing at the end of the period with respect to count 2, namely between 20 April 1986 and 31 December 1989. On one view, the seriousness of the offence might have been reduced if the complainant were almost 16 years of age, rather than if she were 12 years of age. However, in resisting any element of accumulation, the applicant submitted that both offences occurred when the complainant was 12 years of age. That implied that the offences occurred within a limited timeframe, but also that the more serious conduct of sexual intercourse occurred when the complainant was younger rather than older. 

29The applicant did not challenge any particular aspect of the reasoning of the sentencing judge, which set out with some care the objective circumstances of the offending and the circumstances of the applicant. It is, accordingly, not necessary to repeat those considerations.

30There was no attempt in the submissions to explore the relevant sentencing principles with respect to long past offences, nor did any aspect of the challenge made by the applicant raise such matters. It is sufficient to note that these offences occurred in the period between the commencement of the Probation and Parole Regulation 1984 (NSW) on 28 February 1984 and its repeal on 25 September 1989, during which period both the head sentence and the non-parole period were subject to reduction, ""in step in a proportionate sense"", as explained by the Court in R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112 at 118G.

31Not only were the offences committed at a time when there was no longer any legal need to prescribe a non-parole period which was less than half the head sentence, but, in the ordinary run of events, the offender would not have faced sentencing until after the commencement of the 1989 Act. It follows that there is no need to take account of principles which might have operated prior to the ""truth-in-sentencing"" reforms. In these circumstances, and given the statements as to the appropriate course to be taken in imposing sentences after the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989 in Maclay, the Court should consider an appropriate sentence by reference to the statutory guidelines (including the maximum sentence for each count), the range of conduct covered by a particular offence the subject of each count and other sentencing principles which were relevant at the time at which, had a timely complaint been made, the offender would probably have stood sentence. No issue as to perceived ""patterns of sentencing"" arise in this case: see MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213 at [31], addressing the principle stated in Maclay. 

32The trial judge noted that there was no evidence of remorse or contrition on the part of the offender. Not only did the offender deny the offences at trial, but he had (and forewent) an opportunity to accept that his conduct was wrong and had disturbed the complainant in 1988, when she was aged 14 years and had raised her complaints with a psychologist. There was a subsequent attempt to resolve issues within the family through the offices of a second psychologist, but again the applicant was unable or unwilling to accept the consequences of his own misconduct. This was not a case in which the applicant was required to confront allegations of sexual misconduct for the first time 25 years after the events.

33It is appropriate to treat the six month fixed term sentence with respect to count 2 as equivalent to a non-parole period. However, there is a range within which the hypothetical head sentence could fall. For example, there is no particular reason to assume that a significant period of parole was intended, in circumstances where, because of the further sentence to be imposed, the offender would not be released to parole on that sentence. On the assumption that the non-parole period was likely to be in the order of two-thirds of the head sentence, one would infer a head sentence of nine months. It is not possible to say that such a sentence would be outside an available range, although it might be at the high end of the range. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the sentence in fact imposed was manifestly excessive.

34With respect to the sentence on count 3, a more severe sentence was imposed, reflecting the fact that the maximum term for the offence was 10 years imprisonment.

35While it is true that this was not an offence at the high end of the spectrum of conduct covered by former s 66C(2), sexual intercourse without consent involving a degree of force would have attracted a higher maximum penalty. Although the conduct involved a relatively short period of time, I would not describe it as ""momentary"", language which would tend to suggest inadvertence and which would undoubtedly belittle the nature of the offending. It is true that personal deterrence will have a limited role to play in a case such as this. The applicant is no longer in a position of authority with respect to children in his household and is unlikely to be in such a position again. Questions of general deterrence must weigh more heavily.

36While there may be different views as to the appropriate sentence in such a case, there was no material put before this Court to demonstrate that the sentence in fact imposed was outside the appropriate range. Accordingly, while there should be a grant of leave to appeal against sentence, the appeal must be dismissed.

37ADAMS J:

Introduction

38On 31 August 2011 the applicant was found guilty on two counts following a trial of an indictment containing four counts. The counts involved sexual misconduct against his stepdaughter then aged under 16 years. He was convicted on count 2, being the commission (between 15 November 1985 and 22 April 1986) of an act of indecency upon a person under the age of 16 years, an offence under s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (since repealed) and of count 3, the commission (between 22 April 1986 and 31 December 1989) of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16 years and under his authority, an offence under s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act (since repealed). The former offence carried a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment and the latter 10 years penal servitude. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on counts 1 and 4. The applicant was sentenced in respect of the count 2 offence to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 29 March 2012 and concluding on 28 September 2012. On count 3 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 29 June 2012 and concluding on 28 September 2013 with a balance of term of 12 months, concluding on 28 September 2014. The overall sentence was 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months.

39The applicant was on bail during his trial and following the jury's verdict on 31 August 2011. Bail was not continued when he was sentenced on 29 March 2012 but, on 16 August 2012, the applicant was granted bail in the Supreme Court. In the result, the only period of custody served by the applicant was between 29 March and 16 August 2012.

40The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence.

The grounds of appeal against conviction

41These are as follows - 

(1)There was a miscarriage of justice in that the procedure prescribed in s 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was not followed in respect of the applicant's wife. 

(2)There was a miscarriage of justice in that the directions to the jury on coincidence evidence were confusing and inappropriate.

(3)There was a miscarriage of justice in that the direction to the jury on tendency was unclear, confusing and misleading. 

(4)The verdicts on counts 2 and 3 were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 

(5)There was a miscarriage of justice in that the guilty verdict on count 3 was inconsistent with a failure to agree on a verdict in respect of count 4.

(6)The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of SD1 as evidence of coincidence relevant to count 2. 

(7)There was a miscarriage of justice in that the directions by the trial judge, in addition to the directions on tendency and coincidence, were confusing and misleading when considered separately or in combination.

42The consideration of ground one requires only a brief reference to the pertinent facts and I deal with that matter first. Otherwise, given the scope of the remaining grounds of appeal, it will be necessary to summarise the evidence in some detail. 

Ground one - Mrs Versi's evidence 

43The applicant's wife was called as a witness for the prosecution on the fourth day of the trial. On the previous day the Crown prosecutor had indicated that it might be necessary to cross-examine her on some parts of her evidence pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995. No reference was made either to s 18 of the Act, which deals with compellability of spouses in criminal proceedings or to s 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which deals with compellability of spouses in relation to a number of specific offences including a ""child assault offence"" of the kind with which the applicant had been charged. 

44Shortly after the learned trial judge commenced his summing up, the Crown prosecutor pointed out to the trial judge that s 18 of the Evidence Act had been overlooked and needed to be addressed. This was an error since s 19 of the Act provides that s 18 did not apply in respect of proceedings for an offence to which s 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act applied. Without descending into unnecessary detail, s 18 of the Evidence Act permits the spouse to object to being required to give evidence as a witness for the prosecution and, in certain circumstances, must not be required to give evidence. On the other hand, s 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that the spouse is compellable to give evidence in the proceedings unless there is an application to be excused from doing so, which may be allowed but only where the matters in subsection 279(4) are satisfied, namely the application to be excused is made voluntarily, that the evidence sought from the spouse is relatively unimportant or can be otherwise proved and that the offence is a minor one. It is clear that neither of the last two elements applied in this case and, accordingly, had the applicant's wife sought to be excused under this provision, the application must have been refused. As it happened, the wife was called, without objection, to give evidence on the voir dire as though s 18 applied. She said, in effect, that she wished to give evidence and had not intended to decline to do so. There the matter lay, no further application as to it being made, and the judge proceeded with the summing up. 

45It is submitted by Mr Bellanto QC, for the applicant, that this ""ex post facto approach"" was inappropriate and amounted to a departure from the requirements of a trial according to law. In my view, this submission should be rejected. Since s 18 was not applicable and therefore s 279 applied and there was no application within s 279(3) by the applicant's wife to be excused from doing so, no question of compellability actually arose. The admittedly unorthodox calling of the applicant's wife to give evidence on the voir dire during the summing up was, therefore, of no moment. No injustice was occasioned to the applicant by this unconventional procedure. It amounted to a mistaken and immaterial, but fortunately short, interruption in the trial. 

46This ground of appeal has no merit. 

The prosecution evidence of the charges

47In order to deal with the other grounds of appeal, it is necessary to set out in some detail the evidence given in the trial. 

48The complainant gave evidence by videolink. She was born on 29 January 1974. She came to know the applicant when she was about seven years old, he having commenced a relationship with her mother. Eventually he moved into their home in Mosman where her younger brother Nicholas also lived. She was then going to primary school. 

49The complainant said she recalled an incident that occurred when she was about eight years old when the applicant was tucking her into bed one night. This occurred before the applicant and her mother were married. (Therefore before she was seven and a half, although she later became somewhat uncertain about the timing of this event.) At the time she was sharing a bedroom with her brother, although she did not remember her brother being in the room at the time. She said that the applicant tickled her while he was tucking her in, starting on her body (which it seems he often did) ""but then proceeded to put his hands down my pants and tickle my vagina and made jokes about the fact that I was getting pubic hair"". She could not remember exactly what he said. In cross-examination, the complainant said she believed her mother and the applicant were unmarried at this time but agreed that they were in fact married in October 1981, when she would have been seven and a half years of age. The fact of the marriage was used by her as a guide to the timing of the incident but she was sure that she was eight years old at the time and had started to grow pubic hair. This incident was charged in count 1, upon which the jury was unable to agree. Her mother's evidence about another incident (involving turpentine - see below) was that it occurred at the second house and, thus in late 1983, when the complainant was at least nine and a half years of age. She clearly remembered that at this time the complainant did not have pubic hair.

50The complainant said that the family moved house when she was about nine years old by which time the applicant and her mother were married. There was family discussion about renovating the house, involving new bedrooms and a new kitchen. She said that about the time of the move, she had showers with the applicant on numerous occasions, encouraged by her mother. She remembered one distinct occasion, when she was about nine years old, when she was in the shower with the applicant alone. He had an erection and, not knowing what it was at the time, she asked him what it was. She did not remember his response but ""I think he just sort of turned around and tried to hide it"". 

51The complainant said that at the time they moved she was often ill and had been prescribed a lot of antibiotics which, apparently, gave rise to secondary symptoms of thrush, requiring treatment with creams. She said that her mother would ask the applicant to examine her vagina because she was complaining about it hurting or itching ""and so he would sort of, you know, I guess like a doctor like way, inspect my vagina"". She said that it happened on a few occasions when her mother was also in the house. She said, ""it was done in a way that sort of portrayed him as a bit of a - not a medical person but someone who was knowledgeable about the body and its ailments"". This was not the subject of a charge. 

52In November 1985 the applicant and the complainant's mother had twins. She said that her mother went away with them to ""a Tresillian type place"", at least once but she was not sure for how long. During one such occasion, when she was 11 or 12 years old, at Queenwood School (where she started in 1984 in year five, the twins being born in 1985 when the complainant was in year six) she had been playing tennis with her brother in the street one afternoon. She said that she went inside the house to ask the applicant if he could come out to play. She said that he asked her to come up to the bedroom where he was and, going in, ""he then asked me to assist with him putting cream on his penis and testicles"" while he laid back on the bed and instructed her on how to apply the cream. The complainant said she ""didn't feel very happy about it or comfortable with it and I remember trying to, you know, finish as quickly as I could. I'm not really sure how it ended, I just remember getting out of the bedroom and then he stayed there, so I left on my own"". 

53The complainant said that, when they moved to the second house, she was given a bedroom which she occupied for most of the time until perhaps year 11 or 12 although she remembered studying for the HSC in a different room. The second house was a two-storey house with her and her parents' bedrooms always on the first floor. However, there was an extension of the ground floor and the first floor space later constructed, at which time her parents moved into a different bedroom. The complainant did not remember when this was done. However, the incident involving the application of the cream occurred in her parents' first bedroom. In cross-examination, the complainant stated that she did not recall that the applicant's penis was particularly hard at the time; it was lying along his pubic bone and facing up towards his head. She said at the time she did not know what an erection was. She said that when she saw her mother (who had been away at Tresillian or elsewhere getting assistance for the twins and perhaps not overnight) she did not tell her about the incident because she was confused and shocked and felt she could not trust her mother not to tell the applicant. 

54Other evidence showed that the complainant's mother stayed overnight at Tresillian for five days between 18 and 23 January 1986 so that the complainant would not have been at school at the time. However, the complainant said that she was sure that the incident occurred some time at the end of 1985 or early 1986 when her mother was not in the house. The complainant's mother gave evidence that, after her stay at the Tresillian centre, she would go there for a couple of hours during the day so she could sleep whilst they minded the twins and would be back at home during the day because of the school holidays. Records showed that the complainant's mother attended day visits at the Tresillian centre between 29 January and 22 April 1986. This act of indecency was that charged in count 2. 

55The next incident allegedly occurred when the complainant was about 12 years old, in 1986 when she was in year seven. In an exam period during the year she became very anxious and was not able to sleep so she went into her mother's room, asking for a cuddle. The complainant said that her mother got ""quite cranky with me and asked if Peter could go and sort it out... So I wasn't allowed to stay"". She went back to her bedroom and got into bed, followed by the applicant. They were underneath a doona. He lay beside her and started to cuddle her - 

""And then he whispered into my ear, 'This is what you should do when you can't get to sleep' and I didn't know what he meant by that, but he then put his hand down my pants and began to masturbate me for quite a while, and I didn't know what was happening. I just froze really. I just didn't know what to do. I felt terrible, but I just didn't know what to do. 

...

He was moving his finger around my clitoris for a while and around the labia minora and he would also a few times stick his finger into the opening of my vagina just partially and then move back up to sort of move his finger around my clitoris and the, you know, the labia area of my vagina.""

(The complainant said that she did not know the anatomical terms at the time, but learnt about them later.) The complainant said that she recalled saying to the applicant repeatedly that she was okay and he could go, feeling that she was unable to be very assertive. Eventually he left. This offence is charged in count 3 of the indictment. 

56The complainant said that, shortly after, within days, again she was unable to sleep, being very anxious and went into her mother's bedroom again - 

""I just remember the same thing but this time I felt absolute dread because I sort of knew what might happen as opposed to the first time where I really didn't know what was going to happen and he came again into my bed and put his hand down my pants and did the same thing, masturbated me but this time I remember my mum came down the hallway and interrupted and he pulled his hand out of my pants very quickly which was the first indication that I had that let me know that he really knew that what he was doing was wrong and then I realised it was very wrong too. 

...

It was the same as the first time, fingers moving round my clitoris sort of in a circular motion, down around the inner areas of the labia and then dipping into the opening of my vagina so just one finger and just sort of dipping it in.""

57In cross-examination the complainant said that she believed the bedroom door was partially open. She did not recall her mother coming into the bedroom but she knew it was her mother because she saw her and her mother asked if everything was okay. Following this incident, the complainant did not go again into her mother's bedroom for a cuddle in the middle of the night. 

58Obviously anticipating evidence from the complainant's mother, Mr Odgers SC for the applicant put to the complainant in cross-examination that there was only one occasion when her mother told the applicant to help the complainant go to sleep. The complainant denied this, saying, ""I believe that it happened more than once and definitely twice"". She also disagreed that the applicant was in her room for two minutes at most, saying that ""it felt like about 15 minutes"" on both occasions. She described the second occasion as ""a very similar scenario"" adding, ""although I believe the second time I felt absolute dread about what may happen if he came to my bedroom. And I believed that I tried to stop it, I said, 'No, no I'll be okay, it's fine, don't worry about it, I'll be okay', but he came anyway"". In her statement to police the conversation about not worrying and being okay was made after she had returned to the bedroom and the applicant was there with her.

59One of the issues in the trial concerned the timing of the counts 3 and 4 incidents. The complainant's best recollection was that they occurred after the renovations which, she believed, had occurred in 1986. However, she also stated that she was sure that she was 12 years old at the time and attending Queenwood School. She accepted that the house was renovated in stages and that the last stage was the construction of her parents' new bedroom, which commenced in 1988 and continued until 1989. The builder informed the investigating police officer that the work was carried out in stages over a number of years, the major works being carried out in about 1988 and 1989. The complainant said that, when questioned about whether she became aware from conversations with police that there was a question mark about this date, it was possible her recollection of the position of her bedroom was not as sure as she thought it was. The Crown contended that the complainant was mistaken as to when the events giving rise to counts 3 and 4 occurred, submitting they occurred prior to the major renovations and not after. In short, the Crown submitted that the complainant's evidence as to her age when these incidents occurred should be accepted in preference to her placement of them by reference to the renovations. 

60An additional occasion led by the Crown, though it was not the subject of any charge, occurred when the complainant was 14 and ""was really controlling what I was eating"". She said that she was in the bathroom and the applicant had said to her, ""Mum's asked me to come up here to talk to you... Why are you doing this... to yourself?... You know that I think you're beautiful"" and gave what the complainant described as ""a really sort of sleazy sloppy kiss on my forehead while I was in the bath naked alone"". She said, in effect, that she remembered thinking that the applicant was inappropriately attracted to her and knew it was wrong and that she also knew it was wrong ""but it was a very uncomfortable situation for me. I felt really vulnerable and just horrible"". Cross-examination proceeded on the basis that it was accepted that there was an occasion when she was in the bathroom and the applicant had said words to the effect of her evidence, but that he did not enter the bathroom at all, and did not kiss her on the forehead; furthermore, it was put to the complainant that at that time there was in fact no bath in that bathroom. She rejected these three propositions. (Mrs Versi gave evidence to the effect of the cross-examination, which I deal with below.) 

Complaint 

61The complainant said that the first person she told about the applicant's misconduct was her brother Nicholas. She was 12 at the time and Nicholas was 10. She said that they were together in her bedroom with the door closed. She said that she was not sure what she told him but said ""there had been inappropriate sexual behaviour from Peter, and I remember his response was along the lines of, 'Oh no, not this too'."" As she understood it, this was only a reference to something that concerned him but otherwise it had no sinister connotation. Nicholas gave evidence that, when he was 11 or 12, before the renovations had begun he was in the complainant's room when she told him that ""she had to rub cream on Peter's penis"". His response was to say, ""Oh, no, not another thing"". Nothing else was said on that occasion. In another conversation which occurred between them after the complainant's and Nicholas' father had died (5 August 1995) when he was 20 years of age she told him that ""he would come in at random times in the night and masturbate her. And - that again she looked at me"", as he felt, to ask ""Is this right?""

62In year seven or eight the complainant said that she also told her friends Pip Smith and Donna Duggan (who was not called) but could not recall what she said to them. The former gave evidence that, when she was about 12 years old and in about year seven, she and the complainant were at the latter's house when the complainant told her that her stepfather had put his fingers inside her vagina and massaged her. The complainant also gave evidence that she wanted to tell her science teacher, a few days after the bedroom incidents but felt unable to do so. 

63The complainant said that she did not tell her mother about the incidents because she did not trust her. She believed that she would tell the applicant about it as that had been what she did in the past whenever she tried to talk to her about anything confidentially. The complainant said that she was scared of the applicant, who was the authority in the house and very controlling, and at times aggressive and violent. She said that he ""used to scream at me a lot and really didn't feel that I could handle that"". 

64Towards the end of 1988 (although in cross-examination she accepted that it was possible that it was the end of 1989), when the complainant was in year nine, she and her brother were taken by their mother to see a psychologist, Dr Margeson-Towndrow in Bondi Junction because, as the complainant put it, she was an anxious child and her mother believed that she was not coping with the divorce. She had not yet told her mother about the applicant's misconduct. The complainant thought there was more than one session. She spoke to the psychologist alone. She recalled, after general conversation about her life, the psychologist asked, ""Is there anything else that's troubling you?"" The complainant said that she asked if she had to keep confidential anything that she told her and, after being assured that it was just between them, told the psychologist what had happened involving the applicant. The psychologist, as it appeared to the complainant, was obviously quite concerned and mentioned that she needed to try and find a safe place for the complainant to live, mentioning the possibility of going into boarding school. At no time did the psychologist mention telling the complainant's mother about it. 

65It appears that on the next day or so Dr Margeson-Towndrow spoke to the complainant's mother about the issue. The complainant did not give evidence of exactly what she understood the psychologist had said. I gather, however, that she believed it was about the applicant's sexual misconduct. (Mrs Versi gave evidence about what she was told, which I summarise below.) The complainant said that she was at her father's house for the weekend and her mother called her ""quite hysterical and very determined to find out what it was that I needed to tell her"". The complainant said she would tell her when she got home and that the conversation occurred in the late afternoon or early evening of that day. 

66It seems from this that the psychologist had told the complainant's mother that there was an important issue but did not explain what it was. The complainant said that she does not remember exactly what she told her mother but she remembered her mother saying that she was sorry that this had happened, to leave it with her and she would sort it out. The complainant remembered feeling very relieved. However, on the following day, ""I was absolutely in the biggest strife of my life"". She said that her mother was no longer supporting her but obviously supporting the applicant who had denied any misbehaviour and they both accused the complainant of ""making it up to cause trouble to destroy the family"". She said that they screamed and yelled at her to think about the consequences of the applicant going to gaol and how that might affect the twins. She said she was terrified and ""just felt like I'd been thrown into the deep end of a swimming pool with absolutely no one there to support me or back me up and I just didn't know what to do"". She said her mother and the applicant screamed at her ""Get on the phone and ring [the psychologist]"". So she telephoned and said, ""Just forget about it... It didn't happen. Just forget about it. I'll be okay, I'll be okay"". She was unsure about what happened at that point but later (shortly after, as I understand it) they all went to Dr Margeson-Towndrow's office for what the complainant described as a ""sort of a mediation session"". She said that she went in to see the doctor independently whilst her mother and the applicant waited in the hallway outside ""but I don't really remember how it was sort of finalised or resolved. I just don't know what happened but it just was from that day on kind of swept under the carpet really"".

67In cross-examination, it was put to the complainant that she ""did not in fact recant either to [her mother]... or to Dr Margeson-Towndrow"". She answered, ""I don't have any recollection of that"" and, shortly after, said that she was not sure that she said to her mother that the allegations she had made were not true. She said that, after the call to the psychologist and telling her that the allegations were not true the topic was heatedly discussed again between her, her mother and the applicant, during which, although she could not remember the details, she said ""my stepfather actually admitted that he had crossed the line and made a mistake, but that he was just trying to help me, and I don't remember my Mum's response to that, but obviously that satisfied her"". She did not remember him elaborating. In her statement to police of 5 September 2008 the complainant had said - 

""During this conversation Peter acknowledged in front of my Mum that he had molested me or touched me inappropriately. Peter said, 'I know I might have crossed the line and made a mistake, but I was just trying to help her and teach her how to get sleep'."" 

The complainant confirmed that this was her memory of the conversation. (As is clear from the above, the complainant had not mentioned the applicant's admission when giving her evidence-in-chief of these conversations.) She was not aware that the applicant ever confessed in any way to Dr Margeson-Towndrow of wrongdoing.

68Evidence was admitted from the investigating police officer as to her conversations with Dr Margeson-Towndrow, who informed her that she used to practice in the Bondi Junction area but only kept patient records for seven years and did not have anything relating to a child with the complainant's name or any recollection of a patient by that name. She said that she saw approximately 500 children a year.

69The Crown tendered a letter dated 19 May 1991 which the complainant said she found in her diary. (There is no reference to it in the diary and the fact that it was written on that date depends entirely on the complainant's evidence to that effect.) The letter says - 

""I am sick of living like this. I want a normal family.

We are living under a time - bomb - Peter. He is irrational, unpredictable and selfish. I hate him.

No body believes me about what he did to me. No one ever speaks about it. I think they have just dismissed it as me making up the whole story. I hate the way he has so much control over my life and so much dominance over mum, when I know what he is really like. I feel sorry for mum, because she has to put up with it for many years to come. But as soon as I leave school, my first priority is to leave home to get away from Peter.""

70The complainant's evidence about her attitude to her stepfather was, as I understand it, not so much that she hated him, although she did at the time she wrote the letter, but ""there were times when I was very scared of him and frightened by him and confused by him and that I didn't like him very much at times."" She was taken to the fact that her mother had divorced her father, although she was very young being only four at the time, and thought that she would have been happier had they remained together but she had no real recollection of what it was like when they were together. She resented somewhat the fact that the applicant loved his twins more than she and her brother, although she also loved them. This cross-examination was designed, as I understand it, to demonstrate some motive for the making of false allegations against the applicant. 

71During 1993, the complainant moved out of home for six months, renting a unit with a friend and supporting herself with a part-time job whilst she was studying. She then moved back home because she was planning to defer university in 1994 and travel overseas with her boyfriend and could not afford to pay rent and support herself at university. There was an altercation between her and the applicant when he threw out a model she had made for her studies and the complainant then went to stay with her father and grandmother until she went overseas. Towards the end of 1993 she spoke to her father's wife, Cheryl (implicitly though it is not altogether clear) about what the applicant had done and told her that she wanted to tell her father but that Cheryl asked her not to because he would be very upset about it and she worried what he might do since he and the applicant did not have a good relationship. Her father died in 1995. 

72The next occasion that the complainant spoke to a professional person about what had happened, of which she gave evidence, was when she was about 19 (thus, about 1993) and went to see her general practitioner, Dr Phelps (whose married name was Fronzek) and explained that she had been abused by her stepfather although she did not go ""into a huge amount of detail"". She was referred to a counsellor, Ms Janet Alexander. The complainant could not recall whether she gave Ms Alexander any details or merely spoke about the allegations in general terms. She saw her several times before a mediation session took place with her mother, during which her mother became very upset and angry with her and accused her of causing trouble and stormed out of the room. The complainant said that she found this traumatic and difficult to deal with. She said that she could not recall whether she went back to see Ms Alexander to ""have a bit of a debrief, but given the negative experience of it, I didn't feel like I wanted to go back"". 

73In cross-examination (again, I think to deal with matters which were expected to come from her mother) she said that she had no recollection of seeing Ms Alexander in 1990. She was further asked in cross-examination - 

""Q. I want to suggest to you that you did go to see her and that after counselling with her, that you did retract - on that occasion, the allegations that you made about Mr Versi?

A. I have no memory of that.

Q. I want to put to you that you in that period when you were being counselled by Jan Alexander, you were expressly asked if Peter touched you inappropriately and you replied, 'No nothing like that', do you recall that conversation?

A. I don't recall that at all.""

74Also during cross-examination, she said that she did not recall asking Ms Alexander to keep everything she was told confidential or telling her that she did not want to go to court. When the mediation session proved ineffective, she did not go to the police at that time because - 

""I just don't remember anyone ever suggesting that that's what I should do and I, you know, had had such a bad track record of disclosing it and not being believed that I really didn't know that that's what I should do.""

The evidence of Ms Alexander

75Ms Alexander specialised in individual and family therapy. From mid 1991 she started working in Neutral Bay, initially at a townhouse and then in premises almost next door. Her practice was to keep all her files and she had no records of consultations with the complainant or her mother prior to 1994. Her records showed that the complainant was referred on 21 October 1994 for counselling in relation to issues involving child sexual abuse and emotional abuse by Dr Fronzek (whose referral letter was produced). She first saw the complainant on 26 October 1994 when, amongst other things, she obtained a fairly extensive family history. Her notes were tendered and admitted without objection. Ms Alexander believed that 1994 was the first time she met either the complainant or her mother for two reasons: first, that the referral note starts a file and, if she had already seen them the file would already have been in existence and would simply have continued; the other reason was that she could remember Dr Fronzek called and said her she was referring the complainant to her and asked whether she would take the case, partly because the family was well known (although they were not well known to Ms Alexander). In cross-examination, Ms Alexander said that she did not believe that she had misplaced any file, perhaps because of the move, and that her usual practice was always to have a file, even if she only saw a person on one occasion. She conceded that, in retrospect, she had possibly encountered the complainant's mother socially but definitely had no real awareness of her until 1994. 

76In substance Ms Alexander's evidence was that her memory relied entirely on the notes, which to some degree were abbreviated and in shorthand. In effect, she translated them onto the record. The following sets out what she said in point form - 

26 October 1994

Consultation with the complainant and also her mother

- The complainant lived with her mother until two years earlier.

- The complainant's father lives in Palm Beach and that she didn't see him.

- She told her mother about the child sexual abuse/assault when she was 14. She was at first believed and then not.

- The first person she told was a doctor.

- The abuse started at age 8 and ended at age 14.

- Her mother abused and yelled at her and as a result the complainant asked the doctor to not pursue the case to welfare.

- The applicant verbally abused her.

- Her mother denies the effect of the abuse on her.

- The effect of the abuse was that (1) she was angry with the applicant and with her mother for not protecting her. She wants her mother to understand and be sorry; (2) she has nightmares about the applicant which occurred more often when she lived in the house; (3) she felt sadness about the loss of her childhood; (4) she was more moody and would snap if treated badly.

- She would pretend that it didn't happen.

- There had been a bad argument in May and had not seen or spoken to the applicant since.

- She had gone overseas between June and September where she was often upset and realised she needed to confront her issues.

- The complainant's aim was to seek to get her mother to believe her, and to tell her father.

- The complainant's mother said: ""Not to feel like I'm on trial all the time"" and that the complainant doesn't get angry about small things.

- The complainant wanted her mother to accept that something had happened, and that what they talked about was not to go beyond the counselling room

- The complainant's father would be angry if he knew; that he was a cold and lazy father who made promises but didn't keep them; he found it hard to express love.

- The step-father has admitted to being in bed and masturbating the complainant to ""help you get to sleep""; 2 times in bed with the complainant; gave a prolonged kiss on the forehead; made her stand up in the bath when naked and anorexic at 14 years of age; the complainant started the apple diet at age 13 and was vomiting between 16 and 17 years of age.

- The complainant wanted: (1) that the matter not go to court; (2) to establish a comfortable relationship with her mother; (3) to increase her self-esteem and become more positive about herself.

- Dr Margeson-Towndrow in Bondi Junction - that the applicant apologised and admitted masturbation of the complainant to the counsellor i.e. Dr Margeson-Towndrow.

77At a follow up session on 25 November 1994 the following was noted - 

Consultation with the complainant's mother and the applicant

- The complainant had glandular fever in Year 7 and was in bed for 6 weeks; she was depressed; suffered urinary tract infection; in hospital in March Year 12 HSC - Tired for many years; Year 9 Ascham (left Queenwood)

- The applicant very angry about the complainant's rudeness and behaviour towards her mother; also her messiness; he was close to her when she was younger; accepted her as his but did not interfere with her relationship with her father.

78On 2 December 1994 there was a further session with the applicant and the complainant's mother during which the former appeared very angry about the allegations of abuse but nothing appears to have been resolved. That was the last meeting involving Ms Alexander.

79(It seems strange - and it was not explained why this was so - that, despite the references in the notes to consultations both with the complainant and her mother, nothing is noted about what the latter was asked, if anything, or her reaction to the allegations. The only statements noted were that Mrs Versi did not want to feel as though she was ""on trial all the time"" and that the complainant did not get ""angry about small things"". However this oddity was not the subject of questioning, so I say no more about it.)

After 1994 

80There was further evidence from the complainant about the relationship with her mother after 1994, the complainant saying that she tentatively rebuilt her relationship with her mother on the basis that she did not ""rock the boat"" and respected the applicant as her husband. The family went on a trip to Italy, and she enjoyed herself, although she and her brother did not stay in the same accommodation as her mother and the applicant and the twins. Although the applicant gave her away at her wedding, she felt obliged to accept the applicant's suggestion that he walk her down the aisle because he and her mother were paying for much of the wedding. After the birth of her first child in August 2002, she asked her mother to visit her, but denied inviting the applicant to come and stated that she felt uncomfortable when he did so. She asked her mother to baby sit on one occasion for a few hours, possibly more than once, but felt uncomfortable about leaving her daughter there. 

81Over the years a number of postcards and cards were sent by the complainant to her mother and the applicant including father's day cards and birthday cards, which contained handwriting as well as the conventional printed message expressing warm affection. The complainant said that she continued to love her mother even though her mother did not support her.

The complainant's mother

82The complainant's mother was called by the Crown. She married the applicant in October 1981, having separated from the complainant's father about two years previously. At the time of their marriage they lived in a house in Mosman with the complainant and her younger brother and, in 1983 they moved to the second house in which there were two upstairs bathrooms, one of which was renovated when Mrs Versi was pregnant with the twins. By the end of the renovation there was a new bedroom and an additional bathroom. Before the renovations, the applicant's and Mrs Versi's bedroom was next door to the complainant's, the doors being a couple of metres away but afterwards it was on the other side of the house. 

83On 15 November 1985 the complainant's mother and the applicant had twins. Mrs Versi said that sex education was given whilst the complainant was in year five. She went to the information night and thought it was ""far reaching for very young children"". She had spoken to the complainant about menstruation and told her that if anyone touched her inappropriately she should tell her. She also gave the complainant some books to read. It may be that year five was year four, when the complainant was nine years old. Mrs Versi said that her relationship with the complainant until 1987, when she turned 13, was a close and happy one. She said that the complainant was a worried and anxious child. On occasion she would talk about her feelings towards her father and stepmother and sometimes criticise them. Mrs Versi agreed that the applicant at times would raise his voice or lose his temper at home.

84So far as attending Tresillian with the twins was concerned, she confirmed that she was there between 18 and 23 January 1986, which period included a weekend. She believed that the complainant and her brother stayed with their father during this occasion. There were also other visits to a Tresillian centre early in 1986 but she did not stay overnight and would always be home before the complainant and her brother were home from school. She said that the applicant was a ""fabulous stepfather to the children"" and she had no concerns about leaving him in charge of them. 

85Mrs Versi said that the applicant did occasionally suffer from rashes and would have to apply a cream and there was one occasion when, following the children and the applicant playing tennis out in the street they came upstairs because the applicant needed to apply some cream to a rash. The children told him to hurry up because they wanted to go and play more tennis. Mrs Versi said that she gave the applicant some cream. He went into the bathroom. The children were running around in and out of the house. Mrs Versi said that she was on the other side of the hallway upstairs with the twins and the applicant put the cream on and said, ""I can't play tennis anymore. My leg's too sore"". The children were ""disappointed and they were still nagging him and we all went downstairs"". She said that the rash was not in the genital area, but more like the upper leg/ groin area. It was not on his testicles or his penis. She had on occasion seen cream being applied by the applicant to a rash in that area. Her evidence is somewhat unclear about this but it may have been that the door was open whilst the applicant entered the bathroom to apply the cream. Mrs Versi did not believe that the complainant and her brother had played tennis with the applicant in the afternoon after school when she was not home, because he would have been at work. 

86In relation to the bathroom incident, when the alleged kissing occurred, Mrs Versi stated that she recalled one night after dinner asking the applicant to speak to the complainant after the evening meal when the complainant had gone to the bathroom and she was worried that she was going to make herself vomit since she was worried about her weight at the time. She said that the complainant was not really listening to her at this time. She asked the applicant, ""Can you please go and tell her because I think she's going to put her finger down her throat straight after dinner. Can you please knock on the door and tell her that she's beautiful and she's thin enough as she is"". She said that she stood at the bottom of the stairs so she could see what happened. The complainant was about 13 or 14 at this time. She said that he did not go into the bathroom but stayed in the hall. She was cross-examined (with leave) by the Crown about her statement to the police in which she said that she ""was present standing behind Peter"". She said that she meant by that statement that she was standing behind him downstairs and could see him. Mrs Versi could not recall whether the bathroom door was open or closed at this time. She said that there was no bathtub in that bathroom. She was adamant that the applicant did not enter the bathroom.

87So far as the allegations in counts 3 and 4 are concerned Mrs Versi confirmed that she had tried to get the complainant to sleep a few times that night and asked the applicant to help her. She said that the applicant would not have gone into the complainant's room unless she asked him to and, generally, if he went into the room to say goodnight she would be with him. She said that the applicant had never gone into the complainant's room in the middle of the night and did not recall an occasion when the complainant came into her bedroom in the middle of the night because she was upset or nervous and could not sleep. She confirmed that there was a period whilst the complainant was a student at Queenwood when the complainant had trouble sleeping. She recalled an occasion (because it was a ""very difficult night"") when the complainant came out into the hall after having been put to bed, telling her and the applicant how much she was having trouble going to sleep. (She later said the complainant ""must"" have come into the bedroom, but she did not recall this.) Mrs Versi said that she put her to bed many times and tried to calm her down but ""had run out of steam, so to speak, so I said to Peter... 'Can you please see what you can do to help her go to sleep?'"" She said that she lay in bed awake because she never went to sleep until the children were settled. The applicant was gone for a minute or so and came back to bed. She said that it could not have been for as long as 15 minutes since she would have got up to see what was happening. Nor was it 10 minutes; it was much shorter. She said that it was not possible that she fell asleep before he returned. She said she did not walk to the complainant's bedroom at any time before the applicant returned. She did not recall any other occasion except for this one time. She said that there was never an occasion when she walked down the hallway to the complainant's bedroom and asked something like, ""Is everything okay"". Nor could she recall any occasion where she asked the applicant to help the complainant go to sleep but the complainant said not to worry and she would be okay. 

88So far as Dr Margeson-Towndrow is concerned, Mrs Versi said that she took the complainant to see her when she was about 15 because she thought that the complainant would benefit from someone to talk to, since she was a teenager from a divorced family. She did not go with the complainant. After the session, she was called in and Dr Margeson-Towndrow told her that there had been some incidents in their home that she thought were improper. The instances that she mentioned were, firstly, when the complainant had accidentally sat in turpentine that had tipped out from a bottle, the second where the applicant had gone to the bathroom to tell her that she was beautiful and must not lose anymore weight, the third that she had been asked to put some cream on his private area because he had a rash and a fourth where he had gone to her bedroom one night when Mrs Versi had asked him to put her to sleep. Mrs Versi said that the complainant was not there when this conversation with Dr Margeson-Towndrow occurred. 

89Shortly after receiving this information, although she could not say exactly when, Mrs Versi spoke to the complainant. She said that she was ""pretty hysterical. My whole world had crashed down, so I couldn't believe that normal things that had happened in my household were suddenly something that I should think were sinister"". She said that she spoke to the complainant either at home or in a telephone call and the applicant was not present. She could not remember what the complainant said at this time. She said that she could not recall taking the complainant back to Dr Margeson-Towndrow. She said that there were no meetings or mediation sessions with Dr Margeson-Towndrow involving her and the complainant or the applicant and the complainant. She could not recall whether the applicant himself went to see Dr Margeson-Towndrow. However, she later said that it was possible that she and the applicant went with the complainant to see Dr Margeson-Towndrow for some kind of mediation. After the initial conversation with the complainant she agreed that there must have been other conversations in the house which ""was in turmoil"" involving her, the complainant and also the applicant in the day or days immediately after she became aware of the allegations. She said that when she saw the complainant at home she did not recall saying to her that she was very sorry that this had happened and to leave it to her to sort out although she did not deny that it was possible she said that. She said that what she had been told by Dr Margeson-Towndrow turned her world upside down and made her feel hysterical. She agreed that it is possible that she screamed at the complainant and also that the applicant did so. She denied that she threatened the complainant in any way or accused her of trying to destroy the family or that the applicant had done either of these things. She did nothing to attempt to force the complainant to recant the allegations nor, so far as she saw, did the applicant do so. She did not tell her to ring Dr Margeson-Towndrow to recant nor, so far as she was aware, did the complainant recant at that time. The applicant did not make any kind of admission of inappropriate touching of the complainant. She said that there were probably many conversations because the household was ""in total turmoil"" but that she did not recall any occasion when she, the complainant and applicant were having a discussion and the applicant said, ""yes, he had crossed the line and made a mistake but that he was just trying to help [the complainant]"" but, if it occurred, she did not remember it. She later said, ""I guess it's possible. It's a very long time ago"". In cross-examination by Mr Odgers she said this conversation had not taken place in her presence. She said that it was possible that she said to the complainant, ""Why are you doing this? I can't - I can't deal with this"". This occurred such a long time ago and she could not recall all the conversations she had. 

90Mrs Versi said that she knew Ms Alexander both in a professional capacity and as a friend (rather meaning, I think, as an acquaintance). She first met her in her professional capacity in 1990 after having seen Dr Margeson-Towndrow. She said that the complainant had counselling with Ms Alexander as did she and the applicant. They all had counselling together. This was in 1990 and definitely not in 1994. She said that during the 1990 counselling sessions, they addressed all the issues raised by Dr Margeson-Towndrow which were resolved. She said that, when the complainant was asked whether the applicant had touched her inappropriately she said, ""Nothing like that"". Mrs Versi said that she believed that innocent situations had, in effect, been misconstrued so that is why, after having given the matter a great deal of thought, they went to Ms Alexander in 1990, shortly after seeing, as I understand it, Dr Margeson-Towndrow. She said that as she recalled it, the complainant was still at school, which she left in 1991. What she described as ""this resolution"" was obtained with Ms Alexander before the complainant did her HSC, which was in 1991.

91Mrs Versi said that the complainant lived at home until 1993 and she never observed anything abnormal about her behaviour towards the applicant. Nor has she seen the applicant ever being violent towards the complainant. She said that they helped the complainant when she moved out of home in 1993, that the complainant then returned and moved out again in 1994. She did not recall any incident involving the applicant throwing a model, which the complainant had made, out the front door. Mrs Versi said that she saw Ms Alexander again in 1994 because she was traumatised over the falling out with the complainant following a big argument, which resulted in the complainant leaving the home. She said that the argument, was about the complainant's behaviour. She was being argumentative, abusive and had struck Mrs Versi. She went to Ms Alexander for help alone without the complainant. 

92In 1994, when Mrs Versi went to Ms Alexander following the falling out with her daughter, she became aware at some point that the complainant was again making allegations of inappropriate behaviour by the applicant and she went to see Ms Alexander with him. There was some discussion of the allegations which were angrily denied by the applicant. Mrs Versi could not recall a counselling session with the complainant and could not recall any of the things recorded in Ms Alexander's notes. At no point did the applicant make any kind of admission of touching the complainant inappropriately.

93As to the complainant's wedding, Mrs Versi said that Nicholas had wanted to give the complainant away and the complainant said to him, ""just butt out, I don't want you to get involved, I want Peter to walk me down the aisle"". When her child was born, Mrs Versi said that the complainant called and asked if she and the applicant could go, saying, ""are you sure you want both of us to come?"" and that the complainant replied ""yes I want you and Peter to both come immediately"".

94Mrs Versi also gave evidence, that in the early 90s (as I understand it, occurring on a number of occasions) when, the complainant ""would come into our bathroom when she had two other bathrooms to use and sit on the loo when he was in the shower and I was at the basin... chatting to us at the same time like she was just a normal daughter"". 

Evidence of SD1

95The evidence of SD1 was admitted in relation to count 2 only, as coincidence evidence. She was born in 1965 and her younger sister in 1968. When she was five years old her parents separated and, in January 1975, her mother married the applicant. In 1979, when she was 13 and in year eight at school, they moved to a second house. The incident in respect of which she was called to give evidence was related by her as follows -

""Q. As best you can, [SD1], can you describe what you recall happening in relation to that incident?

A. Yes, I came home from school one afternoon, I was on my own. I proceeded down the hallway of our house at... The bathroom was on the right-hand side as I came down the hallway and as I passed the bathroom on the way to probably the kitchen, I observed Peter in the bathroom. I could see him facing the mirror. He was wearing his bathrobe and I could see the reflection in the mirror that he was naked. He called me in. He said he was having trouble with his hernia. I was aware that he had a hernia, I didn't know the exact details but I believed it was, you know, in his groin area. As l drew closer to the bathroom I could see that there was a - that the bathroom basin was full of water. He called me over and asked me to hold his - I noticed his penis was erect and he wanted me to hold his penis so that he could fix his hernia. I did that. I came up to his right-hand side and used my right hand to hold his penis. He then proceeded to sort of grind his hips against my hand. I had to adjust my grip a few times because it was quite awkward. After a while I started to feel very uncomfortable so I said I didn't want to do it any more and I stopped, and then I left the bathroom. I can't remember if he said anything to me but I just remember feeling very uncomfortable and wanting to remove myself from the situation."" 

96Nothing like this had occurred previously nor, up to the time the applicant and her mother had separated in about mid 1980, did it happen again. Nor did her sister ever mention to her that anything like this had occurred to her. The applicant did not tell her not to say anything. Following the separation SD1 and her sister visited the applicant for a while at her mother's insistence, but she found the visits uncomfortable. She did not see the applicant after the end of 1980. Although SD1 was upset about the effect of the divorce on her mother, she denied any feelings of hostility or animosity towards the applicant.

97SD1 said that she came to make the statement following enquiries made by the investigating officer of her mother. She was informed by the officer about allegations of sexual impropriety against the applicant but not given any detail in respect of them. The officer's evidence was to the same effect. 

Evidence of the applicant

98The applicant's evidence commenced with the allegation made by SD1. The applicant denied that this event occurred. He agreed that in 1979 he had a problem with an inguinal hernia, which he had for six or seven years. 

99The applicant denied ever showering with the complainant and ever having tickled her and touched her in the vaginal area. He gave evidence also about an incident in which the complainant spilt some turpentine whilst working on a cabinet in the carport. The complainant sat in it and it burnt her. The applicant was not present at the time although he heard some yelling and screaming. Mrs Versi asked him to carry the complainant upstairs because she was too heavy for her to do so. He said he took her up to the bathroom and Mrs Versi attended to her, he assumed by washing her. He said that he did not touch her inappropriately in any way. So far as the complainant suffering from thrush at various times during her childhood, he denied ever touching her vaginal area to treat this condition. He recalled a time when Mrs Versi stayed overnight at a Tresillian centre for a number of days shortly after the twins were born. He recalled that during this period both the complainant and her brother went to stay with their father. He recalled playing tennis in the street on occasions with the complainant and Nicholas, although not specifically on any occasion when Mrs Versi was not at home. He did recall playing tennis in the street at a time when he had a heat rash problem on one occasion. He said that he stopped playing and went inside the house. He said the inside of his leg close to his groin but also quite a way down the leg started to bleed so he asked Mrs Versi for something to put on it that might help. He said that he had been doing a lot of running and sport and it had started some days before. She brought him some cream which he applied to the area in the upstairs bathroom. He said at the time the children were running around because they were trying to get him to go back to play tennis but he thought they came up to the hall outside the bathroom. He said that he never asked the complainant to place cream on his penis and testicles. 

100He recalled an occasion when the complainant came into their bedroom saying that she had trouble sleeping and Mrs Versi told him to go with her to her bedroom. He said that Mrs Versi had been to see her many times that night and they were both awake. Eventually Mrs Versi asked him to go to see if he could get her to go to sleep and he did so. He said that he got up, put on some clothes of some kind which he could not recall, and went to the complainant's bedroom for perhaps up to two or three minutes. He went to find out what was wrong and why she was not going to sleep and would have asked her what was wrong. He denied getting into bed with her and touching her around the vaginal area. He said it was not possible that he was in the room for 15 minutes. He does not recall any other occasion when Mrs Versi asked him to go into the complainant's bedroom to help her go to sleep. 

101The applicant recalled an occasion when the complainant had gone upstairs after dinner. Mrs Versi was concerned about her losing weight and asked him, because he seemed to have less conflict with the complainant to ""go and tell her not to lose any more weight and that she looked lovely or beautiful or nice or whatever. I don't remember the exact words"". The applicant said he went upstairs and got her attention, he did not know if he knocked on the door or the door was partly or fully open and, when the complainant said ""Yes"" he told her what Mrs Versi had asked him to tell her. He said that he did not enter the bathroom. He then went downstairs and Mrs Versi thanked him. In cross-examination he said that it was possible that there was an occasion when the children were playing tennis on the street and their mother was not at home but insisted that, on the occasion when he had the heat rash, Mrs Versi was at home. In cross-examination the applicant explained that standing at the top of the stairs put him about three quarters of a metre or a metre - the width of the hall - away from the door. His recollection was that Mrs Versi was downstairs, at the bottom of the stairs where, he supposed, she couldn't be seen by her daughter. He could not recall whether he knocked or not. He said that the complainant opened the door, he thought in her underwear. He explained that the complainant was not in the bath because there was no bath in that bathroom. The adjacent bathroom, however, did have a bath. 

102The applicant first became aware of the allegations about sexual misconduct in 1989 or 1990 after Mrs Versi took the complainant to see a psychologist in Bondi or Bondi Junction (obviously, Dr Margeson- Towndrow). Mrs Versi told him about the allegation. He was not present at the time. There were conversations about the allegations between him, Mrs Versi and the complainant. He denied making any admissions to the complainant, his wife or the psychologist. He agreed in cross-examination that he attended Dr Margeson-Towndrow's rooms with the intention of speaking to her about the allegations, but she would not go into detail about them. When he was first made aware of the allegations he was shocked and angry that anything of that kind could be said about him. He said that when he spoke to the complainant about the allegations he was ""pretty angry because what had been said was so horrible and against everything I believe"" and agreed that he had probably yelled such things as, ""Well, how can you say these things?... they're not true"". He denied forcing the complainant to ring the psychologist and say her allegations were not true. He was not aware that the complainant made a telephone call to Dr Margeson-Towndrow and, certainly, he had not instigated her to do so. He denied saying to the complainant that she would destroy the family and he might go to gaol and also denied saying to Mrs Versi and the complainant that he had crossed the line and made a mistake and was trying to help the complainant. 

103The applicant recalled attending sessions with Ms Alexander when the complainant's allegations were discussed. He said that the first time was not November 1994 but was 1990. He went with Mrs Versi and the complainant. Mrs Versi and the complainant went into her room whilst he waited outside. They came out, some discussions still taking place the subject of which he could not recall but (I take it Ms Alexander) asked the complainant ""whether I had touched her vagina"" and she said, ""No nothing like that"". The applicant said that he did not recall seeing Ms Alexander in 1994 although it was possible that he did and that he told her that he was angry about the complainant's behaviour and rudeness towards her mother, that she was messy, that he was close to her when she was younger, that he accepted her as his own child and that he did not interfere with her relationship with her father. He said that the consultations occurred after the complainant left following a fight with her mother. They started, he said, ""because we needed some help as a family again because we needed to talk about the big fight and then I think that's when we found out that she'd raised all these things [which she had raised in 1990] again."" He accepted that he also saw Ms Alexander in 1994, possibly in November when he made a number of complaints about the complainant's behaviour. He did not make any admissions of misconduct during those sessions.

104So far as what occurred after 1994 was concerned, it was broadly speaking, similar to the evidence given by Mrs Versi. 

Character evidence

105I do not propose to set out the evidence given under this head. It is sufficient to say that there were five witnesses called by the applicant, many of whom had seen him interacting in various family and social settings with the complainant over many years. The interaction did not demonstrate any lack of affection between the applicant and the complainant. Their evidence was not sought to be controverted by the Crown. The witnesses had known the applicant and his family for many years. Their evidence was, as far as this kind of evidence usually goes, comprehensive and persuasive.

The prosecution address to the jury

106The prosecutor, after general submissions about the onus and standard of proof, commenced by a thorough and detailed analysis of the complainant's evidence, in light especially of Mrs Versi's evidence, dealing with each of the sexual allegations, including of course, those which comprised the charges. She outlined the complaints to demonstrate how they were consistent in substance with the complainant's evidence. The prosecutor submitted that this material comprised six points: the complainant's evidence; the complaint evidence; Ms Alexander's notes; the evidence of Mrs Versi; the evidence of the accused; and the character evidence. Lastly, she moved to the evidence of SD1. It is, I think, important to note that she submitted, as to the use which the jury might make of this evidence - 

""There is such a similarity between those two acts and I'm specific - number 2 on the indictment, not the others, number 2 - and the circumstances in which they occurred ... There is such a similarity that because of the improbability that those things happened coincidentally you can use that to establish that the accused committed count 2 because coincidence is not a likely explanation. So that's the way you can use that evidence.""

The prosecutor then suggested that, although it was a matter for the jury, they might start with count 2 because, if they were satisfied that the applicant was guilty of that charge, that they could be satisfied that the accused had a sexual interest in the complainant, which could inform their consideration of the other counts.

107The address finished with quotations from the evidence of the complainant as to her attitude towards the applicant and her motive for bringing the allegations of misconduct forward.

The defence address to the jury 

108After some general remarks about the charges and the onus and standard of proof, Mr Odgers pointed to the difficulties facing an accused in having to deal with allegations of wrong doing that was said to have occurred 30 years ago and submitted that an accused in that situation could only do four things, all of which the accused had done. These were, in substance: first, to show how the allegations had changed over the years, adversely reflecting on the honesty and reliability of the complainant; second, to demonstrate that some of the allegations were false, also to adversely reflect on her reliability and honesty; third, to give evidence and subject himself to cross-examination; lastly, to call character evidence. Mr Odgers then pointed to 20 matters which, he submitted, demonstrated significant problems with the complainant's evidence. I do not intend to list them here. It is sufficient to say that they were, though of varying importance, all worthy of consideration. They were succinctly and persuasively put and supported by accurate references to the evidence. Not surprisingly, he relied heavily on the evidence of Mrs Versi where it contradicted that of the complainant and also cited what he contended were inconsistencies and implausibilities in the complainant's evidence. He sought to demonstrate that the complainant was hostile to the applicant from an early age for reasons that had nothing to do with any alleged sexual impropriety, referring to various parts of the evidence that, he contended, demonstrated this to be so. He pointed to the applicant's own evidence denying the allegations and the powerful character evidence called on his behalf. 

109So far as SD1 was concerned, Mr Odgers emphasised the fact that the applicant was not charged with the event of which she gave evidence and that what she said occurred could not overcome what he described as the many, many problems with the account of the complainant. He specifically referred to two matters which he wished to highlight: the first was that, in respect of the incident charged in count 4, her highly implausible memory for detail regarding something that occurred 31 years ago, pointing to her being able to recall that the palm of her hand was facing down and that the applicant's legs were slightly bent because of the height of the bathroom vanity; and, secondly, despite SD1's denials about this, he submitted it was clear that she had and still has considerable animosity to the applicant, referring to a number of matters surrounding the break up with her mother, his entering into a new relationship quickly afterwards with someone with whom she did not like and the miscarriage suffered by her mother, all of these matters being in her statement to police when they had nothing to do with his misconduct. Although SD1 said that these things were mentioned in order to ""anchor a time when the incident... occurred"", Mr Odgers pointed out that there was no need to do this as there was no dispute or question mark about the fact that the separation occurred in 1980 and these details, which were not the subject of any enquiry by the police officer taking the statement, were completely gratuitous and indicated her ill will towards the applicant. 

The summing up

110The trial judge commenced his directions to the jury immediately following the conclusion of Mr Odgers' address, commencing about 12.30pm. The directions were completed by the end of the afternoon, when his Honour adjourned the trial, directing the jury to return the following morning to commence its deliberations. 

111The summing up commenced with a brief recitation of the counts on the indictment and then covered general directions which it is not necessary to analyse: they were in the conventional terms, covering the respective responsibilities of the judge and jury, the distinction between honesty and reliability, the permissibility of accepting the whole or part of a witness' evidence, the distinction between counsel's addresses and evidence, the necessity to consider the totality of the evidence, not only that to which the judge refers or to which counsel has referred, the need for each juror to participate in the consideration of the evidence and the determination of the issues, the onus and standard of proof and, finally, the need for unanimity. His Honour then went to each count, explaining the legal elements of each and the facts upon which the Crown relied to establish the applicant's guilt. There then occurred the interruption to which I have referred relating to the compellability of Mrs Versi. The following exchange occurred concerning the content of the summing up - 

""HIS HONOUR: ... Now counsel, I have been through your address. I will characterise them in this way: I think there were six points you directed the jury's mind to.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour.

...

HIS HONOUR: I wouldn't propose to go through your final address in a way that is sometimes appropriate where there are a series of different --

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: -- to draw to the jury's attention. So far as Mr Odger's is concerned, it's a similar situation. You delineated the 20 points and made the not proved beyond reasonable doubt submission.

ODGERS: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: So, if you have any objection tell me, but that was my assessment of it. In other words, I think you both made the issues very clear.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: [Raised the possible need for a clean copy of the transcript, should the jury want a copy of it.]

HIS HONOUR: ... It would be advisable to produce a clean copy of the transcript. Similar to the point I just made that there's a lot of detail concerning a limited number of circumstances... [And] for a judge to select some of the evidence and not others and it could be confusing for them."" 

112At this point a note was received from the jury as to the meaning of indecency in the counts. After discussion with counsel, the judge gave an uncontroversial answer to this question. His Honour then moved to what was, in substance, a chronology of events starting with the birth date of the complainant, her parents' separation, her mother's subsequent marriage to the applicant, that she had a brother younger than her by about two years and subsequently twin siblings. He mentioned the homes occupied by the family. This, described as ""background evidence"", was not in dispute. 

113The trial judge then moved to the first count, briefly explaining the elements and the Crown case in relation to them before moving to the context in which the alleged offence occurred, dealing with the complainant's recollection of where they were living at the time and her school year to date the offence, the Crown case that Mrs Versi attended a Tresillian nursing clinic for a week or so with the twins and that during this time the children remained in the house under the care and supervision of the applicant. His Honour then said - 

""The witnesses have given their evidence... [by question and answer] and have been carefully cross-examined by the accused's counsel. In both the addresses of counsel they, in order to assist you, went through a lot of the detail of the evidence and the chronology with you so it is not my intention to repeat that detail. What I am trying to do is to make sure that you understand the essential ingredients of the offence and how the Crown makes out its case and the arguments that counsel have put to you and other direction[s] of law that you need to take into account when considering the evidence during your deliberations.""

114His Honour then moved to count 2, briefly outlining the Crown case and then adding - 

""Now it is usual in, within, people's recollection and in trials in the experience of this Court that there are variations in the detail so I have given you the way the Crown outlined the case. Now if the evidence departs from that, that is when you have to decide and Mr Odgers carefully pointed out a number of points, whether or not they are recollection, misrecollections, that will, poor recollections of memory, inaccuracy, or whether there are some deliberate purpose in the evidence being different from what, how, the Crown opened the case but it is up to you to evaluate that when you consider the evidence.""

(I have accepted the transcript prepared by the applicant's solicitor for the purposes of this appeal, it being agreed that the transcript prepared by the court reporters was inaccurate in some respects. It will be seen in this example that there appear to be some repetitions or ""stutters"" on occasion. I am satisfied that the jury would have well understood that this was merely where the judge had corrected himself as his Honour moved through the directions. The meaning of what his Honour said is clear enough. I will deal later with the general complaint about lack of clarity in the directions. The above passage is set out in response to the complaint that the trial judge did not adequately put the defence case to the jury. For present purposes, the passage cited is the only reference to the defence case on count 2 made by the trial judge.)

115The judge completed his account of the facts relied on by the Crown in relation to count 2 and the necessity to prove that this was indecent according to community standards. His Honour then referred to the renovations and moved on to counts 3 and 4, briefly describing the alleged acts and how, on the Crown case, the offences came to be committed. His Honour made no mention of the defence's criticisms of the evidence of the complainant in relation to these charges. 

116The trial judge then took up the coincidence evidence of SD1. 

117In addition to the contention, articulated in ground six, that this evidence was inadmissible, it was also contended (as stated in grounds two and seven) that the directions on this question were confusing and misleading. Here, again, I have used the transcription of the applicant's solicitor of the summing up, setting out the material parts that seem to deal with this particular criticism. The relevant passage is as follows -

""I will turn first to what is called, ladies and gentlemen, the coincidence evidence. This is an important direction, as are the others, but what I am going to say is may not be familiar to you in your day to day lives so it requires particular attention. The accused is charged only with the offences stated in the indictment. You have before you evidence that the Crown relies upon as establishing that he committed the offences, that is accused [pause] complainant. However, you also had evidence before you that the, um, act..., um the accused is alleged to have inappropriately had contacts with... [SD1], that conduct being of allegedly the sexual kind. Now, when we consider what is described as coincidence evidence we consider the similarity between the acts and the circumstances. The Crown case here is that the circumstances were stepfather, stepdaughter in the home. The acts were involved the, each person touching the stepfather's penis, a further circumstance being the alleged purpose of a spurious medical reason. That evidence is before you because sometimes there may be such a similarity between two different acts and the circumstances in which they occurred which I have identified that a jury may be satisfied that the person who did one act must have done the other. Now when I say ""other"" it is important to communicate to you that it is not the others as alleged. It is only count 2 in the indictment because it is count 2 in the indictment that refers to the acts involving the touching of the penis in the medical circumstances that are said to be spurious. You mustn't take... [SD1]'s evidence, ...[SD1]'s evidence into account when you are reasoning in respect of counts 1 and 3 and 4 and if during your discussions it drifts into that then you should correct the position. 

The Crown contends there is such a similarity between the acts and the circumstance and the circumstances in which they occurred that because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally it establishes that the accused committed the act that is the subject of the offence because coincidence is a very unlikely explanation for the similarity or similarities. In this case the Crown says that provided you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct... [SD1] complains of then that act and the circumstances in which it were done was so similar to the act that the Crown amounts to in count 2 in the indictment you would conclude that the accused must have committed the offence with which he has been charged. It is important to note that evidence of such a pattern of behaviour can only be used in the way the Crown asks you if you are firstly satisfied that the accused did the other act beyond reasonable doubt. You must be satisfied that the conduct alleged by... [SD1] occurred and be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before in your reasoning it can assist in deciding whether or not the acts or the conduct alleged in count 2 in the indictment occurred..."" [Emphasis added.]

118His Honour then dealt with tendency evidence in the following way - 

""Now the next area that I want to take your minds to is that of tendency evidences. You may have heard in your general life experience when dealing with coincidence fact, evidence striking similarity. Evidence of tendency can be admitted. The Crown contends that the accused has a tendency to have a particular, to act in a certain way. The Crown says that the conduct alleged in the indictment with respect to counts 1, 3 and 4 demonstrate that the accused had a sexual interest in the complainant and that he was willing to act upon it. By proving that the accused had this sexual interest and he is willing to act upon it the Crown argues that you will find it more likely he committed acts charged in the indictment. Evidence of an accused person having a tendency can only be used in the way the Crown asks you to use it. If you first make two findings beyond a reasonable doubt and the Crown Prosecutor made this clear to you, the first finding is that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an act was committed or acts were committed. In making that finding you do not consider each of the acts in isolation but you consider all the evidence and ask yourself whether you are satisfied that a particular act relied upon actually occurred. If you cannot find that any of these acts is proved beyond reasonable doubt then you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had a sexual interest in the complainant and was willing to act upon it and decide the case on the remaining evidence. If you do find beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of these acts occurred then you go on to consider the second finding. You ask yourself whether from the act or acts that you have found proved you can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the sexual interest in the complainant and that, and he was willing to act upon it. If you cannot draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt then again you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had that tendency, and I will state that in a more summarised way. If having found one or more of the acts to have been proved, that is the acts in the indictment I have just referred to beyond reasonable doubt, and if you can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had this sexual interest in the complainant that the Crown, alleges and that he is willing to act upon it you may use that in considering whether the accused committed the offences charged. Now in other words, you can consider, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a complaint was made out and the two matters I just identified to you. You can use that in considering other charges. It is important to give you two warnings in respect of that because you probably would follow from what I have just said. And the first is you must not substitute or replace the evidence of the other acts for the evidence of the specific charges and very importantly you must not reason that simply because the accused may have done something wrong to the complainant, on another, on another occasion he must have done so on the occasion charged and that re-emphasises your responsibility to consider each charge separately and return separate verdicts in respect of each charge and if the evidence you are not persuaded the evidence is sufficient with respect to one particular charge you can bring in a verdict of not guilty in respect of that charge. If you are persuaded beyond reasonable doubt the charge is made out then you bring a verdict of guilty. But subject to the direction I am just giving you, you can use in your discussions a circumstance of other charges in the indictment. But it is something about which you must we would ordinarily say exercise considerable care and caution in doing that. I would put it to you this way you must be disciplined in doing that and not let your deliberations stray into employing material in some inappropriate way because it is fundamental that these charges are being heard together as a matter of convenience and you mustn't reason that because if you are satisfied that one occasions occurred he must have done others.""

119His Honour then dealt with the evidence of complaint and delay and the prejudice suffered by the defence because of that delay, giving warnings in respect of the latter about which no complaint is made. His Honour then returned to the matters of coincidence and tendency - 

""So you have the evidence of [SD1] that is required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before you can amend it [sic]. You've got the evidence of the various charges finding one beyond reasonable doubt you can employ the tendency approach that I have directed you about."" (Emphasis added)

120His Honour then mentioned, in relation to counts 3 and 4, that it was alleged by the Crown that these offences occurred upon the complainant in her bedroom at the second house while she was attending Queenwood school and submitted that the complainant was mistaken about whether or not the renovations were complete at that time and accepted that they must have occurred, on her evidence, before the renovations. His Honour noted, in relation to this matter, that ""the accused's counsel, in his list of points has pointed to the difference in the evidence and asks you to take that into account in evaluating the complainant as a reliable witness"" and added, ""It is perhaps a good example of the process that you are going to have to go through of evaluating inconsistencies and differences and attributing to them a value"".

121The judge then referred to the evidence of Mrs Versi but only to point out that it was usual for the party calling a witness to be able to cross-examine that witness ""who appears to be unfavourable"" and that the cross-examination was not pursued in any vigorous way but, rather, the prosecutor was attempting to bring out what was actually in Mrs Versi's mind. His Honour said, ""The question is what she said to the prosecutor and what she said to the accused's counsel and what do you make of it"". Aside from stating that Mrs Versi's evidence ""touches many of the issues which you have to decide and the reliability of the complainant in particular and the accused who gave evidence to you"" his Honour did not enter at all into her testimony. 

122The judge then gave a direction on the right to silence, which the applicant exercised when the police sought to interview him, moving on to the alleged admissions made by the applicant, denied both by him and Mrs Versi. He directed the jury that they could not be relied on unless the jury were satisfied that the admissions were in fact made and what was meant by them. 

123After giving directions as to the use to be made of the evidence of good character, his Honour moved to counsel's addresses, commencing with that of the Crown prosecutor. This was briefly summarised as having ""concentrated on six areas"": firstly, the evidence of the complainant who, although in some things was mistaken, for example the date of the renovations, was doing her best to tell the truth; secondly, the evidence of complaint, referring to Mrs Versi's evidence in this context; thirdly to the evidence of the character witnesses; fourthly, acceptance of the onus of proof being on the Crown; then the evidence of SD1 as coincidence evidence and lastly references to the evidence in more detail, asserting that the complainant had not told lies or made false allegations, stated the truth about the matters described in relation to counts 1 and 4, told Dr Margeson-Towndrow about it, when ""it was brushed under the carpet"", and then went to Ms Alexander in 1994 where it did not go very well, her mother walking out and the complainant was disappointed and hurt once more, that she was estranged for a time and decided to restore her relationship with her mother on a superficial level. 

124With respect to Mr Odgers' submissions to the jury, the judge said that it was in many ways a similar and appropriate approach, urging that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any one of the charges was made out. His Honour made a brief additional reference the defence address and concluded. 

125Mr Odgers sought a Markuleski direction, which the judge gave. The Crown prosecutor sought a direction that good character did not provide a defence and to remind the jury that no inference could be drawn adverse to the applicant because the complainant gave her evidence by way of CCTV, which his Honour also gave. 

Grounds two and six - the coincidence evidence

126This evidence was led only on count 2. Two points were taken on the appeal in respect to this matter: the first concerned the admissibility of the evidence of SD1 as coincidence evidence, it being submitted at trial that it was so prejudicial as to give rise to the risk that it would be used by the jury in their consideration of the other counts; the second, was that the language used by the trial judge would have confused the jury. In respect of the latter contention, Mr Bellanto for the applicant conceded that there was no legal error as such in the direction. 

127The relevant provisions of the Evidence Act, for present purposes, are as follows - 

98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: 
(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Note. One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) ...

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.

Essentially, as I understand it, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the evidence of SD1 was so prejudicial in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4 that its probative value in relation to count 2 was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect as it would be likely to divert the jury from a proper consideration of the evidence solely relating to the other counts. This problem was illustrated on appeal by reference to the suggestion in the Crown prosecutor's closing address that the jury should start with considering count 2. Accordingly, it was submitted, the hurdle imposed by s 101, requiring the probative value of the evidence to substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect was not overcome. 

128I do not accept this submission. If it were correct (and it must be) that a determination of the applicant's guilt of any one, two, or three of the counts in the indictment established that the applicant had a sexual interest in the complainant, then that evidence could be used as supporting the Crown case on the remaining count or counts as one of the circumstantial facts which the jury was entitled to take into account. Of course, merely because a person has a sexual interest in a child does not mean that that person has committed some sexual misconduct in relation to the child but it is, nevertheless, a fact able to be taken into account. (This, of course, is tendency evidence; I will come to the applicant's complaint about the directions in this regard shortly.) Furthermore, the guilt of the applicant in respect of count 2 (or, for that matter, of the other counts) necessarily involved satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that he was lying (at, in all likelihood, that his wife's evidence was unreliable) in respect of that offence and the jury would be entitled to use that finding in considering the other counts. 

129It should be observed, however, that there was confusion about the alleged coincidental events, although not any confusion identified by the applicant on the appeal. The fact that the applicant misconducted himself in the particular manner charged was in dispute. If it were proved independently of the evidence of SD1, then resort to any coincidence was otiose. The relevant events here which were coincidental was not the sexual conduct itself but the circumstances alleged by SD1 and the complainant, and the facts that the applicant was the stepfather of both girls, who were of the similar young age. If there had been no opportunity for them to have conferred or jointly concocted their complaints, it was open to the jury to consider that the similarities were such that it was highly improbable that the witnesses were telling lies. That this is so is demonstrated by the obvious conclusion that would arise if, (to take an extreme case for argument's sake) SD1 had given evidence that some time prior to the complainant making her complaint about being asked to apply cream to the applicant's private parts, she had told the complainant about what the applicant had asked her to do. The mere fact that the two complaints related to what might be regarded as strikingly similar circumstances would not, plainly enough, have sufficient probative value to make the evidence of SD1 admissible and it must have been rejected. It should also be noted that both alleged acts - that is to say that involving SD1 and that involving the complainant were in dispute. There was no independent evidence supporting the evidence of either. At base, the true matter upon which reliance was put by the prosecution was that, since both complaints were (to use the vernacular) so uncannily similar, it should be inferred that (absent the possibility of communication) no other inference is, than that the conduct occurred was reasonably open. 

130It was therefore unnecessary that the jury should be persuaded that the applicant had in fact misconducted himself with SD1. The process of reasoning was much simpler: if the accounts were so similar and contained such unusual features as to make accidental coincidence very unlikely, then the complainant's evidence was powerfully supported and the applicant was guilty of the offence under consideration. The fact that he was also - by parity of reasoning - guilty of the same misconduct so far as SD1 was concerned was an interesting but immaterial fact. I have used the term ""very unlikely"", since it is not necessary, as I think, to prove that an innocent explanation was not reasonably possible, merely that it gave substantial support for the evidence whose reliability was in question. 

131The distinction between cases in which the coincidental events are not in dispute and cases in which they are in dispute was explained in Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; (1995) 182 CLR 461 by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ at 482 (references omitted) - 

""An important distinction is to be drawn between cases such as the present case in which the 'similar facts' are not in dispute and cases in which such facts are in dispute. Thus as their Honours [Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ] said in Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 295 - 

'Where the happening of the matters said to constitute similar facts is not in dispute and there is evidence to connect the accused person with one or more of the happenings evidence of those similar facts may render it objectively improbable that a person other than the accused committed the act in question, that the relevant act was unintended, or that it occurred innocently or fortuitously. The similar fact evidence is then admissible as evidence relevant to that issue.'

Where the propensity or similar fact evidence is in dispute, it is still relevant to prove the commission of the acts charged .... The probative value of the evidence lies in the improbability of witnesses giving accounts of happenings having the degree of similarity unless the events occurred. Obviously the probative value of disputed similar facts is less than the probative value those facts would have if they were not disputed. But the prejudicial effect of those facts may not be significantly reduced because the prejudicial effect that the law is concerned to guard against is the possibility that the jury will treat the similar facts as establishing an inference of guilt where neither logic nor experience would necessitate the conclusion that it clearly points to the guilt of the accused..."" 

132The note to s 98 of the Evidence Act says that the evidence might still be admissible even if the occurrence of one of the events was disputed. The example given by the ALRC report explicates the kind of situation in which this might be so - 

""For example, if the Crown has evidence that the accused committed another substantially similar crime, the evidence could go to the jury on the basis that, if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that: (i) the accused committed the other substantially crime; and (ii) that the same person committed that crime and the crime charged the jury should be satisfied that it was the accused who committed the crime which he or she is charged."" 

Many variations on this theme can easily be posited but none of them are similar to the circumstances in this case.

133Accordingly, the trial judge was, with respect, correct to allow the evidence of SD1 to be tendered as evidence of such similarity as to lend substantial support to the evidence of the complainant. Since, if the jury were satisfied that count 2 were proved beyond reasonable doubt, they were entitled to use that finding as establishing the existence of a sexual interest in the complainant, that resulting circumstantial fact could be used in its consideration of whether the applicant had committed the other charges, there was no merit in the objection to its admissibility. As to the risk that the jury might simply move from being satisfied that the applicant had misconducted himself with SD1, or for that matter, was guilty of count 2, to being satisfied of his guilt on the other counts, his Honour directed them that they must not so reason. It is not contended that these directions were erroneous.

134However, the coincidence directions (particularly the italicised portion in the quotation above) invited the jury to move directly from being satisfied that the applicant had acted towards SD1 as she alleged, to the consequential guilt of the applicant on count 2 of the indictment. The correct line of reasoning identified above - namely that, if the conduct described by SD1 and the complainant bore such particular or unusual features as to render it very unlikely that fabrication (or, perhaps, confabulation) was an explanation of their similarity, then they were entitled to regard the coincidental accounts as supporting the truthfulness of the complainant's evidence about the offence - was not put to the jury. At the same time, the judge's direction that it was necessary to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant had misconducted himself with SD1's evidence before the coincidence between her account and that of the complainant could be used, favoured the defence. His Honour did not say (though in my view it would have been correct to do so) that the coincidental account of the complainant could be used to support the evidence of SD1. 

135I have mentioned that the evidence of SD1 could only be significant as coincidence evidence if it were proved that there was no opportunity for communication between her and the complainant (or, if there were, that neither communicated their complaint to the other). It is obvious that the parties did not direct their attention to this issue. It will be seen from my summary of the evidence that it would seem most unlikely that there were any such communications, the sense of the evidence being that the two families remained very much separated and there being no suggestion of any interaction. It is significant, as it seems to me, that Mr Odgers did not deal, whilst questioning SD1 or in address, with the question of the coincidence or the possibility of communication but, rather, concentrated on the contention that SD1 fabricated her accusation, motivated by hostility for the applicant. (Of course, if it were indeed independently made, that she happened to be hostile to the applicant, if true, would not weaken its coincidental force.) If the fact of non-communication were in issue, the prosecution bore the onus of proving it, as essential to an assessment of the cogency of the coincidence evidence. It seems, however, that it was simply accepted that communication had not occurred and the case was approached by prosecution and defence on that basis. The trial judge (with respect, rightly) did not advert to this matter in the directions to the jury.

136(I note that perhaps the evidence of SD1 was also tendency evidence, but it was not proffered on this basis and it is not useful to explore this possibility.) 

137So far as confusion in expression is concerned, I have (at the request of applicant's counsel) listened to the recording of the summing up on this matter. It is enough to say that I do not accept that there was a realistic risk that the jury would have been confused by what the judge said or the manner in which he said it. I note that Mr Odgers made no complaint about this matter at the close of the summing up. 

138It follows that the directions as to coincidence evidence were in error but for reasons other than that raised on the applicant's behalf. 

139We have not had the benefit of submissions from the parties on the significance of what in my view is an error in the coincidence directions. It is, of course, not possible to know whether the jury's verdict as to count 2 involved relying on the evidence of SD1 beyond reasonable doubt or whether they simply believed the complainant. A reading of the transcript does not suggest, it should be stated in fairness, any reason why SD1's evidence should not have been accepted but, of course, this Court has not had the opportunity of seeing her give evidence. 

140I would conclude, at all events, that the applicant has not lost ""a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted"" (per Fullagar J, Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514) or ""a real chance of acquittal"" (per Barwick CJ, R v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 376): see Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365, per Brennan, Dawson, Toohey JJ at 371-2. However, in Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300; 80 ALJR 444; 158 A Crim R 133; 223 ALR 662 the High Court pointed out (at [40]) that care that must be taken with these formulations of the statutory test. The Court described the task of the Court of Criminal Appeal as follows (omitting references) - 

""That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognising that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself.""

141Recognising the ""natural limitations"" arising from considering only the written record, I conclude that the coincidence between the two complaints is such that it should be concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant's evidence in respect of count 2 is truthful and reliable and that of the applicant cannot be accepted nor, to the extent that it impinges on this matter, can that of Mrs Versi. There is no reason to suppose that the jury disregarded the judge's emphatic warning to the jury that the coincidence evidence concerned only count 2. Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider further whether the error I have identified infected, as it were, the jury's conclusion as to count 3. 

142Accordingly, despite the error as to the use of the coincidence evidence, ""no substantial miscarriage of justice"" was actually occasioned and I would apply the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Grounds two and six should be rejected. 

The tendency directions

143The tendency identified as available following proof of one or more of the counts was that the applicant had a sexual interest in the complainant and was willing to act upon it. The judge warned the jury that this was the only way in which a finding of guilt could be used. (This was rather favourable to the applicant, since the jury were also entitled to draw adverse findings as to honesty in respect of the applicant and, at least, as to reliability in respect of Mrs Versi, if they found the applicant guilty of one or more of the charges.) His Honour warned the jury that they were not to substitute or replace the evidence of the other acts which they found were committed for the evidence of the specific charges and emphasised that the jury must not reason that because the accused had committed one offence or more on another occasion, even if that is an occasion for which he had been charged, he must have done so in respect of the particular charge under consideration. Certainly, the global way in which the trial judge dealt with the consequences of a guilty finding on one charge for the other charges did not make for clarity. It is obvious that one would only need to consider tendency where there was an outstanding charge under consideration. I am quite satisfied that the jury would have understood this. Again, no application was made for any redirection by Mr Odgers for the applicant. I am satisfied that there was no material misdirection and certainly no miscarriage arose from it.

144The ground of appeal, as pressed on appeal, rested on what was submitted to be unclear or confused directions as to the use to which the evidence of tendency might be put. At Mr Bellanto's request, I have listened to this part of the summing up. I would accept that there were some obscurities and misspeaking. However, they were not such as to have led to any real risk that the jury might have been confused or misled. I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that Mr Odgers did not seek any redirection upon this ground. Ground three is rejected.

Ground seven - the summing up as a whole

145Mr Bellanto urged the Court to listen to the recording of the entire summing up, submitting that this would make good the applicant's complaint of the risk that the jury was confused about the matters which they were required to heed. No specific arguments were made concerning confusion as to any parts other than coincidence and tendency and there is nothing in the transcript dealing with the other issues that suggests any real risk of confusion, so I have declined to accede to counsel's request. I see nothing in the transcript provided by the applicant to suggest that the occasional misspeaking was such as to give rise to a real risk that the jury were misled or confused either as to the facts or the law. 

146The applicant points to the direction by the judge that, ""If you are not persuaded the evidence is sufficient with respect to one particular charge you can bring a verdict of not guilty in respect of that charge"", submitting that it was a misstatement of the onus of proof. (The emphasis on the word ""can"" is to identify the source of the alleged error, not to suggest that the trial judge emphasised this word: the thrust of the direction was to emphasise the importance of distinguishing between charges.) This direction, although not happily phrased, would have been understood in light of the emphatic direction given earlier by the judge - 

""In a criminal trial there is only one ultimate issue, has the Crown proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt? If the answer with respect to any of the charges in the indictment is yes, the appropriate guilty verdict; if the answer is no, the verdict must be not guilty."" [Emphasis added]

No redirection was sought in relation to this matter, not surprisingly. I do not think for a moment that the jury might have laboured under the misapprehension that, even if they were not persuaded of the sufficiency of evidence as a charge, they could still convict. It is also submitted that the following passage diluted the standard of proof - 

""By proving that the accused had this sexual interest and that he is willing to act upon it the Crown argues that you will find it more likely he committed acts charged in the indictment.""

It seems to me that this statement of the matter was correct. The Crown did not argue that the presence of the sexual interest established the applicant's guilt but was a fact to be borne in mind together with all the other facts in relation to each charge which, in the Crown's submission would lead to a guilty verdict.

147Accordingly, I would reject ground seven. 

Ground five 

148This ground relies on the ex facie inconsistency between the guilty verdict on count 3 and the failure to agree on a verdict in respect of count 4. 

149In MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367-8, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ quoted the following statement from R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 per King CJ at 593 (with whom Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ agreed) -

""[J]uries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.""

Their Honours commented at 368 (references omitted) - 

""We agree with these practical and sensible remarks.

... Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and commonsense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. 'It all depends upon the facts of the case'.""

150It is sufficient to say in this case that the circumstances of each charge, as related by the complainant, differed somewhat. In relation to count 3, the jury must have accepted that the applicant had gone to the complainant's bedroom at the instance of Mrs Versi when the complainant had said that she was finding it difficult to sleep, entered her bed and committed the sexual assault which she described. The second interference in her bed, which the complainant said occurred only within a day or two of the first, was cut short by her mother coming into the hallway close to the door and asking if everything was all right. Considering the proximity of the two occasions, a juror may have thought that it was possible that the complainant had confabulated and had not been prepared to accept that her memory was reliable as to two events of the same kind happening in a short space of time. Furthermore, Mrs Versi agreed there had been one occasion such as that described by the complainant when she had sent the applicant into the bedroom to settle her. Although she said he was only away for two minutes, this might well reasonably have been regarded by the jury as an unreliable qualification, given the lapse of time and Mrs Versi's own expressed (indeed, apparent) difficulty in accepting that her husband had misconducted himself in any way. There was no such support, however, for the second incident. Furthermore, as the Crown submitted, the evidence of penetration was somewhat less clear in relation to count 4 where the complainant's initial description, though it referred to masturbation, did not make any reference to penetration. She said that when her mother ""came down the hallway and interrupted... he pulled his hand out of my pants very quickly"" although when specifically asked by what she meant by masturbation on the second occasion the complainant said that it was the same as the first time and gave a description which would amount to penetration. I am not persuaded that the verdict on count 3 is relevantly inconsistent with the failure to agree on a verdict on count 4.

151In my view, this ground of appeal should be rejected. 

Ground four

152It is submitted for the applicant, in substance, that the complainant's evidence was so unreliable both when considered by itself but also when the evidence of Mrs Versi and the applicant are taken into account, together with the character evidence, that the verdict should be set aside as unreasonable or one that cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence: s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The relevant principles have most recently been discussed by the High Court of Australia in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400. French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ summarised the position as follows (references omitted) - 

""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

[11] It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty'.

[12] This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.'

[13] The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.

[14] In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality': In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'."" 

Their Honours considered that, in the judgment under appeal, this Court had ""concerned itself with whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support the verdicts, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence... [which] inquiry is not what is required by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act"" (at [20]). Their Honours went to point out that, on appeal, ""the task of the Court of Criminal Appeal was to make an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, to determine whether the verdicts of guilty could be supported"" [22]. 

153It must certainly be accepted that the prosecution case in respect of each count depended on the acceptance by the jury of the evidence of the complainant as to its truth, accuracy and reliability. There is no doubt that the complainant was mistaken as to the date of the renovations which was one (but certainly not the only) marker for the dating of the acts alleged in counts 3 and 4. Her evidence was also contradicted on a number of significant matters by her mother, quite apart from the applicant's denials. One might accept that in some cases a mother in the position of Mrs Versi finds it impossible to accept that her husband has committed sexual misconduct against a child, especially a child of their's and, has perhaps, closed her eyes to what an unbiased witness might have thought was at least problematical behaviour. It is, however, an altogether different matter for a witness such as Mrs Versi to fabricate evidence which, in respect of a number of matters, must have occurred if the complainant were telling the truth, though it is possible perhaps that some other differences with the complainant's evidence (accepting that evidence to be true for the sake of this discussion) were perhaps reconstruction and confabulation, driven (as it were) in favour of the applicant by her strongly held opinion that he was entirely innocent. Other relevant matters reflecting on the complainant's evidence are the delay in complaint, not altogether satisfactorily explained; the lack of consistency in the nature of the complaints made from time to time; and the implausibility of the applicant making any admissions, especially admissions to Mrs Versi whose attitude to the allegations, as recounted to her, had that occurred, is even more unlikely. It is fair also to observe that, as mentioned above, a number of the witnesses called to give character evidence also gave evidence about the apparent normality, indeed mutual affection, which they observed between the applicant and the complainant during family occasions when the witness was present over significant periods of time. However, that evidence may have been discounted as superficial, given the undisputed evidence of allegations made by the complainant to third parties.

154A number of other criticisms concerning matters which the complainant could not recall and unclear recollections were enumerated in the applicant's submissions to this Court. It is unnecessary, as I think, to repeat here all the defence arguments or, for that matter, the countervailing matters put by the Crown. 

155In significant part, there is nothing in the evidence of the applicant and Mrs Versi in particular which, so far as the transcript goes, suggests that the evidence they gave on the important issues was not truthful or reliable and, on my reading, their evidence does not demonstrate significant inconsistencies or implausibilities, nor hallmarks of, as it were, putting their heads together to fabricate untruths. But it cannot be denied that the jury in this case had a very substantial advantage over this Court in assessing the significance of these matters. 

156Leaving aside the evidence of SD1, so far as one can judge from the transcript, it is fair to say, I think, that there are sound reasons for concluding that the evidence of the complainant as to counts 2 and 3 was not so persuasive as to dispel the significant doubts raised by a number of seeming implausibilities and inconsistencies. However, to my mind (to adopt the language of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487), these doubts are resolved by the ""jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence"". Making full allowance for these advantages, I do not think that ""there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted"". 

157Accepting that I may have underestimated the problems with the complainant's evidence, the decisive matter which I have found convincing is the evidence of SD1. As I have mentioned, SD1 was cross-examined to suggest that she was motivated by her dislike of the applicant to fabricate the account she gave of his misconduct towards her. I have explained that this does not really deal with the significance of the coincidence evidence. That coincidence can only be explained by some communication between the complainant and SD1 of which there was no evidence or any material which might lead to a suspicion of joint concoction. I have previously mentioned the absence of any focus on this question but I think that, reading her evidence fairly, it is inconsistent with the reasonable possibility of this occurring. It is one thing, as it seems to me, to come forward with a distasteful allegation out of resentment or dislike, however strong, but quite another to fabricate it. Accepting that the Crown did not seek to adduce evidence on this matter, nevertheless the defence did not suggest to the complainant that she had any communications at all with SD1 nor was it put to SD1 that she had communications with the complainant. 

158In the result, I am of the view that the coincidental accounts given by the complainant and SD1 cannot be explained by the reasonable possibility of joint concoction. This must lead, to my mind, to the rejection of the evidence of the applicant and Mrs Versi in respect of count 2. I hasten to add, in fairness to Mrs Versi, that this is not to say that her evidence about an instance in which the applicant applied cream in their bedroom as deposed to by her was untrue, but it certainly leaves open the possibility of an instance such as that described by the complainant, when she was not present. Taking the coincidence evidence into account - and bearing in mind the problems with the complainant's evidence - I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant is guilty of count 2.

159This conclusion has the effect of very significantly changing the conclusion which one might otherwise draw from reading the evidence of the applicant and, for that matter, the evidence of Mrs Versi: as it were, the calculus of assertion and denial. It shows that the applicant's denial of the cream application incident is false, a finding as to his credibility which can and should be used to assess the credibility of his denials, otherwise apparently believable, in respect of the other counts. It also shows, that Mrs Versi's evidence on this point is either unreliable or irrelevant, possibly reflecting reconstruction over the years fuelled by her opinion about the applicant's innocence. Moreover, once it be accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of count 2, this demonstrates a sexual interest in the complainant which makes it more likely that her evidence about the other incidents is truthful.

160Accordingly, I consider that ""the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged"" (see SKA at [21]). Furthermore, if it be relevant, I am myself persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt of the charges of which he was convicted. It follows that this ground of appeal must be dismissed.

Imbalance in the summing up

161This was not a ground of appeal. In the course of his submissions on ground two, Mr Bellanto (as he put it) interrupted himself to observe, in effect, that the summing up was imbalanced in the sense that the trial judge referred to the prosecution case in some detail and made little reference to the way in which the defence put its case. This is not the appropriate way in which to take a substantive point of appeal and it should be inferred that no such error forms part of the appeal. I note, in passing, that very experienced counsel took no such point at the trial. 

Conclusion on the appeal against conviction

162I would therefore grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal as to each conviction.

The appeal against sentence

163I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Basten JA (with whom Latham J agrees) concerning this ground of appeal. Their Honours would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. With respect, I do not agree with this outcome. The following are my reasons for this conclusion.

164The applicant was aged 62 years and 8 months as at the date of sentence. On count 2 of the indictment the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 29 March 2012. Considering the fixed term as a notional non-parole period and assuming the same variation of the ratio between the full term and non-parole period that was applied to the effective non-parole period and the overall sentence (60 per cent) the starting point for this sentence was 10 months. On count 3, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 months commencing on 29 June 2012 (hence, accumulated by 3 months on the sentence for count 2) with a balance of term of 12 months. Accordingly, the overall sentence was 2 years and 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months. The statutory ratio between non-parole period and overall term was, therefore, 60 per cent rather than 75 per cent. (I refer below to the special circumstances that led to this calculation.) 

165The ground relied on for the appeal against sentence was that it was manifestly excessive and outside the appropriate range, the applicant submitting also: the sentences should not have been accumulated; the primary judge erred in his Honour's assessment of objective seriousness; excessive weight was given to the requirement of general deterrence; the sentences were higher than those which would have been imposed at the time the offences were committed; and the sentencing judge erred in failing to apply to the non-parole periods the same calculation that would have been used at the time of the offences.

The objective features

166There was no dispute in this Court as to the facts found by the primary judge. His Honour noted that the applicant was the stepfather of the complainant, and the offences thus constituted an abuse of his position of trust and authority. So far as count 2 was concerned, his Honour found that the applicant procured the complainant, then ""a 10 year old or thereabouts"", to rub cream onto his genitalia as he lay on a bed. (Although no point is taken in this regard, the indictment specified an age of 11 or 12 years, and the evidence was inconsistent with any earlier age.) The judge said he did not fully accept that the applicant's claim of the presence of a rash and for some ""assistance of a medical kind"" was a ruse. He considered that ""what happened... [was a] spontaneous or impulsive reaction"". In respect of count 3, the judge found that the complainant, being unable to sleep, went into the bedroom of her mother and the applicant to ask her mother for a cuddle. Her mother woke up and asked the applicant to deal with the complainant. He took her back to her bedroom, got into the bed with her and, whispering words along the lines of, ""this is what you do when you can't get to sleep"" put his hand down her pants and briefly placed his finger inside her vagina, in the words of complainant, he ""sort of dipped it in"". 

167The judge accepted as correct the Crown's submission that the offences were spontaneous, although there was ""some evidence of inappropriate context... when the offender kissed and cuddled the complainant inappropriately"" and added - 

""Other than to say the misconduct was spontaneous it is difficult on the evidence to reach firm conclusions as to the offender's motive."" 

His Honour found that the offences did not represent an ongoing course of conduct or persistent abuse towards the complainant. 

168It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the ""facts could be fairly described as falling at the lower end of objective seriousness"". The judge considered that the force of this submission ""is very much reduced having regard to the age of the complainant"", making no distinction between the offences. Referring to the aggravating matters listed in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and, having noted in relation to the victim's age and vulnerability and the applicant's abuse of trust and authority, that the former was an element of both offences and the latter an element of count 3, his Honour said -

""It was not the worst case by any means but was very serious misconduct of a sexual kind against a child... What was involved here were two discrete acts against the one victim twenty-five years ago. ""

169The judge declined to find that the applicant had committed an offence against SD1 since it could not be known whether the jury so found in reasoning to the conviction on count 2. Of course, it was therefore a matter for his Honour to decide and he was entitled to take into account, for this purpose, the coincidence evidence. Be that as it may, no point was taken by the Crown in this respect. The conclusion that the offending conduct appeared to be out of character was thus somewhat favourable to the applicant, although it is fair to observe that the evidence supported the conclusion that the applicant had not committed any other offences. 

170Dealing with subjective factors, the judge noted that the offender had no previous convictions, was between 36 and 40 years of age at the time of the offences and found, since they were committed, the applicant had been of ""impeccable character"" despite his having ""commonly been in situations which provided the opportunity for misconduct"". He accepted that the applicant had undertaken ""considerable community work in particular raising funds for worthy causes"". Although the not guilty plea and the applicant's continued denial of guilt precluded a finding of remorse, his Honour concluded, in light of his good conduct since the offences, it ""is very unlikely that any re-offending will occur"" and that ""there is no present sign, indication or suggestion that the offender is in the category of persons who have an ongoing sexual interest in children"". His Honour concluded that, the ""minimal"" chance of re-offending diminished ""slightly"" the role of personal deterrence and consequently the length of the sentence. As well, the applicant ""is entitled to a slight reduction in the sentence that otherwise would have been imposed for his good character over the past twenty years or so"". In respect of general deterrence, his Honour said - 

""In cases of sexual misconduct against children, any sentence imposed must embrace a very substantial element of general deterrence. This is particularly so where the offender is in a position of trust"".

The complainant's age

171I have already mentioned the judge's reference to the age of the complainant when the offence in count 2 was committed. The situation so far as count 3 is concerned is not so simple. The age of the complainant at the time of the offence, as particularised in the indictment, was 12, 13, 14 or 15 years. Furthermore, if the complainant had been 15 years of age at the time, given that the charge in the indictment extended to 31 December 1989 and the fact that the complainant's 16th birthday would have been 29 January 1990, she may have only been a few months short of her 16th birthday when the offence was committed. The evidence was conflicting as to the date of the offence, the Crown's case being that it was earlier than the date indicated by the complainant's evidence.

172This issue was not taken up directly in the sentence proceedings. In the context of a submission as to whether concurrent or partially cumulative sentences should be imposed, the prosecutor submitted that, in accordance with sentencing practice at the time of the offences (if committed within a short period, which was conceded) the Crown would support a wholly concurrent sentence. The judge responded, ""Yes, I accept that."" In his written submissions, senior counsel for the applicant had conceded that the age of the complainant at the date of both offences was about 12 in the context of submitting that the sentences should be concurrent. In the result, however, the judge accumulated the sentence on count 3 by 3 months on the sentence imposed on count 2. The reason given for this course was that it was ""appropriate"". His Honour did not refer to, let alone make any finding about, the age of the complainant at the time of the count 3 offence or the time frame of the offences or, for that matter, the correctness of the submission as to the practice at the time of the offences. Considering his Honour's reasons as a whole (particularly the observations as to what was demonstrated by the table of cases) I have concluded, with respect, that his Honour simply decided that, despite the past practice in this respect, the sentences should be accumulated to some degree. 

Delay

173The judge noted that it is not uncommon in child sexual assault cases for there to be a substantial delay between the offences and the laying of charges. He mentioned the young age of the complainant at the time of the offences and briefly set out the evidence as to complaint and the responses of the applicant and Mrs Versi. Although there was no reference to the reasons for delay after the complainant became an adult, as I understand the effect of his Honour's reasons, the delay in bringing the charges was not due to any tardiness of the authorities and hence this factor was immaterial.

The sentencing practice at the time of the offences

174The judge observed that the sentences should accord with ""the sentencing standards current at the time"" of their commission, citing R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 130 A Crim R 481; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 and AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; (2007) 169 A Crim R 32 at [39]. Referring to a schedule of old sentences together with some prior cases which were relied on in submissions by the applicant's counsel, his Honour said this material should not be applied ""in a mechanistic way"", adding that it showed the ""continuing requirement to impose sentences that recognise the objective seriousness of sexual assault"" and the ""applicable sentencing standards expressed in prior cases emphasise the importance of general deterrence in cases of sexual misconduct"". His Honour made no reference to the general level of sentencing shown in the material, nor specifically to the practice as to non-parole periods. 

175The judge found special circumstances applied, stating - 

""The present practice is not necessarily to reduce the sentence on account of any executive policy of remissions that might have applied to the offender had he been sentenced when the Probation and Parole Act made such provisions. However, those circumstances justify a finding of special circumstances quite apart from the other subjective features which may have produced the same finding. Although not determinative, other factors indicative of special circumstances include the offender's age, [and] the fact that this is his first time in custody.""

Character, deterrence and delay

176The consideration of these questions requires some further discussion of the relevant principles. 

177The first of these matters concerns the character evidence tendered by the applicant. This was unusual because of the number of witnesses who provided written testimonials and those who gave evidence at the sentence proceedings. It is fair to say, I think, that neither the testimonials nor the evidence was formulaic. The witnesses all expressed their disbelief that the person whom they thought they knew well could have committed the offences of which he was convicted. There was also convincing evidence that, over many years, the applicant had participated to a significant degree in fundraising for and providing services to charities and their events including Rotary, The Royal Children's Hospital, The Starlight Foundation and Stepping Stones House. He received a commendation award for instigating and organising, as a private citizen, substantial financial contributions and material support for the SES, police and volunteers engaged in rescue operations in the Thredbo landslide disaster in 1996. Accordingly, the applicant's otherwise good character involved more than mere absence of prior or subsequent convictions and what might be regarded as private virtue. Nor were his ""good works"" used to provide an opportunity for the commission of the offences. 

178A useful starting point for considering the significance of good character in connection with sentencing an offender for sexual offences is Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267, where the applicant (a priest for many years) had pleaded guilty to nine counts of indecent assault, three counts of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years knowing that he was not consenting, one count of gross indecency, one count of indecency, with 39 additional offences taken into account. The appropriate principle is, as McHugh J said (at [25]) - 

""If an offender is of otherwise good character, then the sentencing judge is bound to take that into account in the sentence that he or she imposes. The weight that must be given to the prisoner's otherwise good character will vary according to all of the circumstances."" [Original emphasis.]

179Not surprisingly, and given the nature and extent of Ryan's offences, ""his otherwise good character could only be a small factor to be weighed in the sentencing process"" (McHugh J, ibid [33]). The two identified features in this regard were, firstly, that whilst Ryan was doing ""good works"" he was at the same time committing grave offences and, secondly, the ""good works"" at the heart of his claim of good character were the priestly duties in the course of which he committed the offences and of which he took advantage to do so. Accordingly, although Ryan was certainly entitled to some leniency, he was not entitled to significant leniency (ibid [35]). To the same effect see Callinan J at [174] citing, with approval, R v Hermann (1988) 37 A Crim R 440, an appeal against a sentence of an offender of apparent good character who had sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter on a number of occasions over a period of three years. Where Lee J (with whom McInerney J agreed; Kirby ACJ dissenting) said (at 448) - 

""So far as the question of good character is concerned, it has been pointed out in other cases that, where the event is not an isolated one, it is difficult for the court to give a great deal of consideration to an accused's 'previous good character', for the truth of the matter, as the evidence has disclosed, is that whilst appearing to have a good character and others believing so, he has over a lengthy period been committing a heinous crime on a helpless child. To give to an applicant's so-called 'previous good character' much weight in such circumstances is to give an appearance that the court is conceding to a parent or person in loco parentis or within the family unit some right to use a child for sexual pleasure at will. Of course, when the offence is an isolated one, the matter of the good character of the applicant as a factor in mitigation may be given a much greater degree of significance."" [Emphasis added.]

Callinan J referred also (Ryan at [175]) to the reduction of the effect of good character where a series of crimes are deliberately and carefully planned and executed (citing R v Morley [1985] WAR 65). 

180Although it is fair to say that it is appropriate in cases of child sex offences to limit the significance of the offender's otherwise good character, the extent of so doing is not fixed: the particular facts are important. Thus, in R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527, Howie J (Simpson J agreeing) said -

""[21] It is unnecessary for the purposes of determining this appeal to consider the circumstances in which a court may legitimately determine that it will give less weight to prior good character as a mitigating factor. Generally speaking such a situation might arise where general deterrence is important, the particular offence before the court is serious and it is one frequently committed by persons of good character. Another situation may be where the prior good character of the offender has enabled him or her to gain a position where the particular offence can be committed. 

[22] Less weight might also be given to prior good character in a case where there is a pattern of repeat offending over a significant period of time. That will frequently be the case in child sexual assault offences because such offences are often committed during a period of an ongoing relationship between the offender and the complainant."" 

See also R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 per Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and I both agreed) at [45] - [69]. 

181I would also add, though perhaps it does not need mentioning, that obviously the nature and extent of the character evidence must also be taken into account. In this case, that evidence, together with the isolated and aberrant nature of the two offences calling for sentence, indicates, to my mind, that it should be given somewhat more than slight weight.

182The second issue concerns the complainant's age at the date of the offence in count 3. There can be no doubt that, as a general rule, the younger the victim of a sexual assault, the greater is its objective seriousness: see, for example, PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84 per Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) (at [11]), where her Honour observed (references omitted) - 

"" ... [The] case law recognises the seriousness of sexual offending against younger persons, including, as a general proposition, that the younger the child, the more defenceless and vulnerable the child will be. The case law, over the last two decades at least, is consistently to the effect that in sexual offence cases, the younger the child, the more serious the criminality"". 

Her Honour added (see [12]) that the particular vulnerability of a child of young years is recognised by the principle that, even where the age of the victim is an element of the offence, the age of the child within the specified range is still material. 

183Although the evidence would not justify a finding, adverse to the applicant, that the complainant was aged less than 15 years at the time of the count 3 offence, as mentioned above, senior counsel for the applicant, at first instance, submitted that the complainant was about 12 years of age at the time of both offences. As mentioned above, the judge made no finding about this. However, it should be inferred that his Honour acted upon the basis of the agreed position. This question was not agitated in the appeal except in the sense that it was submitted by the applicant that the sentences should have been concurrent and by the Crown that the accumulation was appropriate. In my view, this Court should proceed on the basis put by the parties in the sentence proceedings. 

184The third important consideration is the significance of delay, both as to the weight to be given to personal and general deterrence and the effect of the sentencing practices as they applied at the time of the offences. 

185It is appropriate to accept the primary judge's findings that the two offences were isolated and the applicant poses no risk of re-offending. The following observation of Howie J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) in Regina v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534; (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 applies -

""[81] ... In a case such as this where there has been such a lengthy delay between offence and sentence and where the offender is rehabilitated, it is the fact of imprisonment rather than the length of the sentence which will be of greatest significance to punish the offender and denounce his conduct. Although general deterrence is important it can never be allowed to dictate a sentence which is not proportionate to the offence committed or appropriate to punish the particular offender before the court.""

These observations were repeated by his Honour (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) in AJB v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 51; (2007) 169 A Crim R 32. Commenting on the practice in 1982 (until the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989) that a non-parole period was fixed somewhere between a third and half of the term of the sentence, his Honour said (at [39]) - 

""... [One] consideration in determining ...[the] non-parole period was the seriousness of the offence and the requirement of general deterrence. General deterrence was not a significant matter in the applicant's case because in light of the very lengthy period that had transpired between the offences and the passing of sentence and his reform it was not appropriate to make an example of him to deter others from similar conduct.""

186Furthermore, in light of both the isolated and aberrant character of the offences, the absence of subsequent offending, and the minimal likelihood of re-offending, it was also appropriate to sentence the applicant on the basis that personal deterrence is a factor of little significance. 

187Noting the observation of Howie J in AJB at [31] that it was not appropriate for the Court ""to try to replicate, not only the sentencing practices of 1982, but also the executive practices of that time in respect to the treatment of prisoners"", Basten JA (with whom RS Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreed) said in Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 - 

""[11] The remission system operated not pursuant to the general law, or executive act (although there were areas of discretion) but pursuant to regulations made under the Prisons Act 1952 (NSW) and, at the relevant time, the Prisons Regulation 1968 (NSW). The entitlement to 'ordinary' remissions varied depending upon whether the offender had previously served a period of imprisonment of three months or more. If so, he or she was entitled to remission of one-quarter of the sentence period; if not, the entitlement to remission was one-third of the sentence period. (The relevant provisions are conveniently found in Smith v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) [1980] 2 NSWLR 171 at 183-185, in the judgment of Hope JA; see also Smith v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) [1980] HCA 49; 147 CLR 134 and Green v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) [1982] 1 NSWLR 327.) 

[12] As explained by Gleeson CJ, Hunt and Loveday JJ in Maclay, it was established principle that the sentencing judge should not increase the sentence to counteract the effect of anticipated remissions on the period to be served. However, that did not mean that the court ignored the anticipated remissions. With the introduction of the parole system pursuant to the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW), it became necessary for the sentencing judge to take account of the likely diminution on account of remissions in order to avoid 'the absurd result that a prisoner would be, as a result of the remissions system, released before the expiration of the non-parole period specified by the sentencing judge, with the result that the non-parole period would be rendered nugatory' [13] There might be a nice question as to whether it would now be necessary to consider the sentencing practices at the date of the offending, or as at the date of likely sentencing. With the commencement of the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW), the absurdity which had previously existed was removed by providing for remissions to apply to the non-parole period. The result was, again in the words of the Court in Maclay, that 'all marched precisely in step in a proportionate sense': at 118G. However, the courts held that 'neither in relation to head sentences nor in relation to non-parole periods were sentencing judges to increase terms to negative the effect of remissions that would be applied to them': Maclay at 120D. 

[14] Applying the law, rather than executive practice, a sentencing court, whether in 1981 or 1984, would have fixed a non-parole period on the assumption that the overall 'sentence period' would be reduced not only by one-third, on account of ordinary remissions, but also for 'earned' remissions and, in all probability, other remissions which might accrue from time to time, such as 'special strike remissions', designed to recognise the increased harshness of imprisonment during periods of industrial action by prison officers, which were not uncommon.""

Accordingly, since in that case the sentencing judge's imposition of a non-parole period at two thirds of the overall term, which would not have accorded with sentencing practice at the time of the offending, error was demonstrated and the non-parole period should be fixed at one third to one half of the head sentence (see also RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [86] - [93]). The present case, to my mind, is no different in substance. Here, of course, the offences were committed after the commencement of the Probation and Parole Act 1983, so that the fact that the non-parole periods would have been reduced by the application of remissions must be ignored.

188Since, under the Probation and Parole Regulation 1984, remissions applied also to the non-parole period (as they did to the sentence) it was not appropriate for a sentencing judge to make allowance for the likely reduction in the head sentence by way of remissions, as this reduction would have been effected pursuant to the Regulation. Moreover, the judge was not able to take into account the possibility or likelihood of the reduction by increasing the non-parole period which was imposed: R v O'Brien [1984] 2 NSWLR 449; R v Paivinen [1985] HCA 39; (1985) 158 CLR 489. In 1986, however, s 21A was inserted into the Probation and Parole Act entitling the judge to order, in effect, that the remissions otherwise applicable, should not be applied in a particular case where to do so ""was desirable by reason of the nature of the offence or the antecedent character of the [offender]"", so that the full non-parole period imposed would be served. The effect of this provision was undermined by this Court's decisions in R v Rogers (1987) 8 NSWLR 236 and R v Evans (1987) 8 NSWLR 540, that it was inappropriate in any circumstances for a sentencing judge to exercise the power conferred by s 21A. In R v Watt [1988] HCA 58; (1988) 165 CLR 474 the High Court held that this approach amounted to an abdication of jurisdiction and the section should be applied according to its terms. In R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112; 46 A Crim R 340 this Court held, considering the situation after remissions were removed by the Sentencing Act 1989, that there should not be a reduction in sentences in an attempt to adjust for that removal. 

189Spigelman CJ (with whom Grove and Sully JJ and Newman AJ agreed, Mason P contra) concluded, in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368; (2002) 130 A Crim R 481 at [31] that it was appropriate for a court to take into account - 

""... the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of an offence when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender."" 

As Garling J (Basten JA (with additional comments) and R A Hulme J agreeing) said, in MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213 at [80] - [81] this principle has been regularly applied by this Court, though not without difficulty. His Honour went on to summarise the present position - 

""[82] The difficulty arises because the sentencing court is being asked to reflect sentencing patterns or practices from earlier times, in a sentence being imposed at a much later time. In order so to do, the court must have a clear picture of what those earlier sentencing patterns and practices were. And, that picture must be as comprehensive as is possible.

[83] In some circumstances, it will be possible for the relevant sentencing pattern to be capable of being readily discerned. As cases such as Shore, Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71; (2008) 183 A Crim R 540, PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84; 216 A Crim R 365, and Magnuson [[2013] NSWCCA 50] show, a comprehensive identification of similar cases, or else references to readily available statistical databases may assist in establishing earlier sentencing patterns. But, as experience shows, such sources need to be considered with some care because of inherent difficulties with them. For example, are the cited cases truly representative of those decided over the period, or else how is it that the statistical tables or analyses provided take into account, and identify, the wide variations in objective criminality and subjective circumstances. Statistical tables of sentencing outcomes are always to be treated with care.

[84] However, if a sentencing pattern is readily, and reliably discernable, then such material ought be put before the sentencing court for it to be taken into account. Ordinarily, it is not to be thought that a sentencing court will know, without assistance, what earlier sentencing patterns were. Much less is it to be ordinarily thought to be appropriate that material of this kind is not put before a sentencing judge and then is deployed on an appeal to this Court. 

[85] Whether or not such a sentencing pattern can be reliably discerned, other historical matters relevant to sentencing practice can be identified, and ought be considered as part of the sentencing process. One such historical matter is the then existing statutory regimes under which a person would have been sentenced, including whether the legislation provided for, or else sentencing practices reflected, non-parole periods of a specific length or ratio to the overall sentence: see AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51 169 A Crim R 32 at [36]-[38] per Howie J, Adams and Price JJ agreeing; MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261 at [27] per Hidden J, Campbell JA agreeing, at [43]-[48] per Smart AJ, Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [16] per Basten JA.

[86] However, in ascertaining any legislative provisions which may impact upon sentencing practices, the court does not engage in understanding the impact, if any, of executive practices on sentence. A ready example was the, now discontinued, executive practice of granting remissions to prisoners with respect to their head sentence: see AJB at [31]. Even if this practice was not truly an executive one, the operation of the remission system ought not be reflected in sentences which are imposed now: Rosenstrauss at [10]-[12] per Basten JA, R S Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing.""

190His Honour went on to refer to the use of judicial recollection as providing a basis for or a confirmation of the existence of a sentencing practice or pattern and the problems with this course. The position as to non-parole periods is quite different. It is accepted that sentences imposed prior to the Sentencing Act of 1989 involved non-parole periods usually in the order of one third to one half of the head sentence and a sentencing judge should take this into account in considering whether there are special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act justifying a reduction of the non-parole period which would otherwise apply. 

191In this case another feature is material. As I have already mentioned, it was submitted by the prosecutor to the primary judge that, were his Honour to hold (as it was submitted he should) that the two offences were committed within a relatively short time span, the applicable sentencing practice at the time of their commission would have been that the sentences would have been wholly concurrent. Even though there are substantial problems with a judge applying his or her recollection of past sentencing patterns, as it happens my own recollection coincides with the agreed position taken in the sentencing proceedings. In my view, that position should be accepted and applied by this Court. At the same time, the overall sentence must reflect the total criminality involved in both offences.

192The applicant provided the sentencing judge with case summaries of indecent assault offences more or less similar to those here under consideration, which were committed in the 1970's and 1980's, a list of sentences passed between 1970 and 1985 for the offence of indecently assaulting children (many of which involved other sexual offences including intercourse), a list of sentences passed between 1992 and 2006 for offences committed through that period under s 61M(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1900, a table of indecent assault cases where non-custodial sentences had been passed between 1990 and 2005 and, lastly, a table of sentences under s 66C(2) (sexual intercourse with a child between 14 and 16 years, under authority) passed between 1986 and 2003. The possible utility of this material was significantly reduced by the lack of any attempt at analysis. It is not for the Court to construct the argument to which the tender of such material is directed. Nevertheless, the overall picture leaves me with the distinct impression that the sentences imposed at about the time of the offences were somewhat lower than would now be imposed, even after adjusting for the increased maximum penalties. Also produced were Judicial Commission statistics of sentences passed between 2006 and 2012, which do not distinguish cases on the basis of the applicable legislation. Since the legislation had significantly changed between that which applied to the offences under appeal and these dates, the statistics are not useful. 

Conclusion

193With respect, it seems to me that the sentencing judge overstated the weight that needed to be given to the considerations of personal and general deterrence and understated the significance of the applicant's good character. Furthermore, given that a non-parole period of between a third and a half of the head sentence would have applied at the date of the offences, his Honour's application of a ratio of 60 per cent, without an explanation for doing so, and where nothing in the facts argues for such a differentiation is also, with respect, an error. 

194To my mind, the sentences here are not manifestly excessive, either individually or overall. However, error having been demonstrated, this Court must consider for itself whether lesser sentences are warranted and, if so, to impose them in lieu of the sentences under appeal: Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284. 

195Certainly the age of the complainant at the time of the offences is a significant component. For all that these offences were at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness, they were inherently grave, involving a breach of trust and sexual interference with a young child whose personal integrity, it was the duty of the applicant to protect, and the abuse of which exposed her to long term adverse consequences. For these reasons, I consider that a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate.

196So far as count 2 is concerned, the abuse of the applicant's authority increases the seriousness of the offence. The maximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment must apply to acts of indecency of much greater gravity, involving children of a much younger age than 11 or 12 years and direct intimate interference with their physical integrity, together with the use of force and threats. This offence was disgusting and humiliating but involved no threat or force, was over quickly and there was no interference with the complainant's person. With respect, this was not only not ""the worse case by any means"" but, having regard to the range of circumstances comprehended by the section, was well within the lower range of objective gravity. Such a finding would seem to be inconsistent with the starting point of ten months, bearing in mind, furthermore, that the scale of available sentences is not linear by any means. 

197In respect of the count 3 offence, this also involved no threat or force and was momentary. The extent of interference was slight, indeed the least capable of constituting the offence. The (somewhat uncertain) age of the complainant was approximately midway between the ages contemplated by the section. This offence also was very much at the lower end of objective seriousness for offences comprehended by the section. 

198I have already referred to the relevant subjective features. The applicant is now something over 64 years of age. It is appropriate to apply a non-parole period of between a third and a half of the overall head sentence, the special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Sentencing (Criminal Procedure) Act 1999 comprising the sentencing practices at or about the time of the offences together with the applicant's age. Having regard to the consideration to which Howie J referred in Moon (quoted above), it seems to me that the appropriate ratio is in the order of 40 per cent. Following his sentence on 29 March 2012, the applicant was granted bail in the Supreme Court on 16 August 2012. He has thus spent 141 days in custody, which should be taken into account in the manner envisaged by ss 18 and 28A of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

Proposed orders

199I would propose the following orders - 

(1)Leave to appeal against conviction is granted.

(2)Appeal against conviction is dismissed.

(3)Leave to appeal against sentence is granted.

(4)The appeal is upheld, the sentences are quashed. In substitution therefore, the following sentences are imposed - 

(i)on count 3, the appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of nine months imprisonment and a balance of term of one year and three months;

(ii)on count 2, the appellant is sentenced to a fixed term of four months.

Disposal of the appeal

200As the appellant was granted bail pending the outcome of this appeal, the sentences under appeal, in accordance with ss 18 and 28A of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 must be directed to recommence on the date of this judgment, the appellant being required to serve the balance of the sentences (rounded down slightly). Accordingly, the Court makes the following orders - 

(1)Leave to appeal against conviction is granted.

(2)The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

(3)Leave to appeal against the sentences imposed is granted.

(4)Appeal against the sentences is dismissed.

(5)On count 2 of the indictment the appellant's fixed term is directed to recommence on 14 November 2013 and expire on 23 December 2013.

(6)On count 3 of the indictment, the appellant's non-parole period is directed to recommence on 14 November 2013 and expire on 23 December 2014, with a balance of term of 12 months commencing on 24 December 2014 and expiring on 23 December 2015. 

(7)The appellant is to be released on parole on 24 December 2014.

201LATHAM J: I agree that the conviction appeal and the sentence appeal ought be dismissed for the reasons provided by Basten JA. I provide these additional reasons for joining with Basten JA with respect to the sentence appeal.

202As Basten JA notes, the sole ground of appeal against the applicant's sentence was that ""the sentence was manifestly excessive and outside the appropriate range"". The assertion that the sentence is outside the ""appropriate"" range adds nothing to the submission that it was manifestly excessive. The written submissions relied upon by senior counsel do not distinguish between the sentences imposed for the individual offences and/or the aggregate sentence. 

203There is nothing in the written submissions that explicitly attributes error in the findings made by the sentencing judge. To the extent that Adams J has inferred from the applicant's written submissions a number of errors, I would draw attention to the following matters.

204The height of the submission in relation to the accumulation of the sentence for count 3 on the sentence for count 2 to the extent of 3 months is :-
any penalty on count 2 should have been properly absorbed within the penalty on count 3. They occurred when the complainant was aged approximately 12 years and there is no need, in fairness, to apply the principle of totality. The totality approach is appropriate where there are a large number of offences and where the offences are not closely related in time and nature and where there is more than one victim.

205The determination to partially accumulate sentences is an exercise of the sentencing discretion. The judge was required to impose an appropriate sentence for each offence, having regard to the relevant maximum penalty, and then consider, in the exercise of his discretion, how best to structure the sentences in order to arrive at an aggregate sentence which appropriately reflected the totality of the applicant's criminality : Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57 ; 194 CLR 610 at [45]. It is not a question of fairness to the applicant. It is not the law that the principle of totality is only ""appropriate"" in the circumstances described by the applicant. The applicant does not (and could not correctly) submit that it was not open to the sentencing judge to partially accumulate the sentences. Unless the applicant can demonstrate that the discretion to do so miscarried in the House v The King sense, there is no error. Of course, that is a distinct consideration from the question whether the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive.

206The applicant's submissions on the objective gravity of each offence simply state that counts 2 and 3 are ""at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness"". The judge's finding was that the submission that the applicant's conduct (on each occasion) fell at the lower end of objective seriousness was ""very much reduced having regard to the age of the complainant. It was not the worse case by any means but was very serious misconduct of a sexual kind against a child."" (I agree with Adams J that this Court should approach the appeal against sentence on the basis that the complainant was about 12 years of age at the time of each offence.) 

207Clearly, his Honour assessed the objective gravity of each offence as above the lower end of the scale, whilst accepting that the conduct was spontaneous or impulsive. The applicant does not submit that the judge took into account any irrelevant consideration or failed to take into account a relevant consideration. The assessment of the objective gravity of an offence is part of the process of instinctive synthesis. Moreover, it is not necessary to make a detailed or specific assessment of where an offence falls on a notional scale where the offence does not carry a standard non parole period : Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71] to [74] per Simpson J (Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing) ; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [46] per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing). The applicant has not demonstrated any error and has not submitted that the judge's finding in general terms was not open to him.

208The applicant's submissions with respect to specific and general deterrence consist of general statements of principle that do not advance any error on the part of the judge. The delay between the commission of the offences and sentence, the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and the low risk of re-offending were all addressed by the judge in his remarks on sentence. The applicant's reliance upon delay fails to take account of earlier efforts by the complainant to report the offences.

209The applicant's reliance upon Simpson J's comment in R v Jenkins (1999) NSWCCA 110 at [38] that ""his Honour rightly considered general deterrence to be an important factor in the sentencing decision but, in my view, he allowed that single factor to override, to an impermissible degree, the applicant's favourable subjective circumstances, and particularly the finding that he was unlikely to re-offend"", is also misplaced. That statement explains and supports a finding by her Honour that the sentence under consideration was manifestly excessive, a proposition that was rejected by every other member of that bench (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, Newman and Hulme JJ). In any event, Simpson J was not laying down a statement of principle. Her Honour was merely dealing with the circumstances of that particular case.

210In the instant case, the judge's observation that ""in cases of sexual misconduct against children, [particularly where the offender occupies a position of trust] any sentence imposed must embrace a very substantial element of general deterrence"" is entirely orthodox. There is nothing in that statement that demonstrates the attribution of excessive weight to that factor.

211As for the assertion that the sentences and non parole period imposed were higher than those imposed at the time of offending, I agree with Basten JA that perceived patterns of sentencing in 1985 and 1986 play no part in this application.

2762774,R v Warren ROSS (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 2043,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The accused applies for the exclusion of evidence from Asana Deaves and Tandara Warrick-Deaves, the siblings of the deceased. They are currently 9 and 7 years of age respectively. They were respectively 7 and 5 years of age at the time the infliction of the fatal injuries. 

2Their evidence in chief will be adduced by playing their records interviews on 27 August 2011 and 8 September 2011 respectively. 

3To the extent that the evidence is sought to be used for tendency purposes, I have already ruled that Asana's evidence meets the tests in s 97 and s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act), but only taking into account the content and the tests for tendency evidence against an accused, but not any difficulty associated with competence to give evidence or contamination of the evidence. I ruled that Tandara's evidence did not satisfy these tests and is not admissible or to be used for tendency purposes. Issues have been raised as to competence to give evidence, and whether the unfair prejudice of the evidence outweighs its probative value for reasons other than the tendency use of the evidence. 

4While the tests under s 101 of the Act overlap with, or are similar to, the tests under s 137 of the Act, the material now before the Court goes beyond the mere content (by way of transcript) of the evidence sought to be adduced. 

5The application under s 137 of the Act is based on the proposition that the probative value of the evidence includes its reliability and is, in law, relevant to the exercise of the discretion to exclude the evidence. Further, the accused submits that the evidence is only indirectly relevant, because it is not evidence of the infliction of the fatal injuries. Therefore, it is submitted, the bar for unfair prejudice to outweigh probative value is lower. 

6The basis for the foregoing submission is that neither of the young girls attests to seeing the infliction of the fatal injuries. 

7At the time of the fatal injuries there were five persons at the home of the deceased. They were the accused, Ms Donna Deaves (the deceased's mother), the two girls and the deceased. 

8During the course of the evidence so far, there have been suggestions that the deceased may have sustained the injury by accident associated with falling from a cupboard or bed. Other suggestions are that the injuries were sustained from one or other of these impugned witnesses hitting the deceased with a child's swing or other object. 

9Whether or not all of those suggestions are ultimately made, the impugned witnesses give evidence of the whereabouts of the deceased (i.e. that she did not sleep in her bed or on her mattress); and that she stayed home when the eldest child, Asana, went to school on the Friday. They also give evidence of certain punishment regimes on the days leading up to the death of the deceased. 

10Given the place these issues play in the circumstantial support for the evidence of Donna Deaves, even though neither child witnessed the infliction of the fatal injuries, I do not consider their probative value low. On the contrary, the evidence of each of them is significant and the absence of their evidence would be significant. 

11The application under s 137 must be approached on that basis. 

12One is always reluctant to require a young child to suffer the trauma of giving evidence, or to relive the trauma of any stressful situation, which the child is being asked to recall. However, that factor is not unfair prejudice to the accused. 

13The prejudice identified by or on behalf of the accused can be categorised as matters affecting reliability and accuracy of the evidence. The interviews, in unedited versions, show, it is submitted: that the timing of questions or answers was problematic; that the witnesses were from time-to-time unresponsive; that some questions were plainly misunderstood or the answers plainly (or known to the Court to be) incorrect; internally inconsistent; illogical (e.g. remembering something in her sleep); obvious failure of memory or inconsistency with independent or other evidence; and, the answers to some questions were strange. 

14The prejudice that is said to be unfair is that, by virtue of their age and the manner in which, of necessity, they must be cross-examined, these issues will be unusually difficult to test. This, it is said, will be particularly unfair and unfair in a manner of which the jury will be unaware or in which jurors would be inexperienced. 

15Further, the manner of the interviewing includes the putting of some propositions, some known to be incorrect (at this stage and ought to have been known then). 

16There are a number of responses to these issues. First, the reliability of the evidence is a matter for the jury: R v Keenan Mundine [2008] NSWCCA 55; (2008) 182 A Crim R 302; R v Linard Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228; Adam v R [2001] HCA 57; (2001) 207 CLR 96. To the extent that some reliability issues are obvious from the interview itself, the jury is in as good a position as counsel and the judge are. 

17Secondly, the members of the jury will have as much experience with children as do counsel and the judge, perhaps more. The assessment of witnesses is one of the reasons juries are used in criminal trials. 

18Lastly, there are issues associated with contamination of the evidence, being either discussions between the girls, or between each of them and others. There is evidence on the voir dire that establishes such conversations occurred, but not the full content of the conversations. 

19There will be, no doubt, some difficulty in cross-examining each of the children. That is true of all children. In criminal trials, with a jury, those difficulties are exacerbated because of the effect on the jury, were the cross-examination to be as searching as it might have to be. 

20Nevertheless, these are not unusual or insurmountable difficulties. And they apply to all young witnesses, who, by their age or circumstance, engender empathy. In this case, unlike most, the child is not the victim and the evidence not as essential. Nevertheless, as earlier stated, the evidence has a significant probative value. 

21The issues associated with possible contamination, and other issues of difficulty, can be the subject of direction or warning from the Court, which, in all of the circumstances, will overcome most, if not all, of the unfairness. That which is not overcome is overwhelmingly outweighed by the probative value of the evidence. 

22In the foregoing exercise of weighing, I have weighed the probative value of the evidence, taking account, notwithstanding Shamouil and others, of its reliability and the age of the witnesses. I have also weighed that value against any unfairness to the accused. 

23I take the view that ""unfair prejudice"" is slightly narrower than the term ""unfairness"". Similarly, not all prejudice is unfair. For example, the restrictions on cross-examination associated with the age of the witness creates an imbalance, which is, on one view, unfair, but may not be ""prejudice"" in the relevant sense. Nevertheless, I have taken it into account in the exercise of my discretion. 

24I do not consider in those circumstances that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, and I reject the objection.

		20 August 2014",2013-11-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762780,R v Rawlinson [2013] NSWSC 1722,"Judgment


	
	Section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides as follows:
	


""30 Change of venue

In any criminal proceedings, if it appears to the court:

(a) that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had, or

(b) that for any other reason it is expedient to do so,

the court may change the venue, and direct the trial to be held in such other district, or at such other place, as the court thinks fit, and may for that purpose make all such orders as justice appears to require.""


	
	The accused is presently scheduled to be tried along with two of his co-accused for the murder of Katherine Foreman at Wollongong commencing on 3 February 2014. He seeks an order by notice of motion filed on 28 October 2013 that the venue for the trial be changed from Wollongong to Sydney. That application is made in the following circumstances.
	


Background


	
	Ms Foreman grew up, lived and worked in the Wollongong area and the surrounding localities such as Port Kembla, Balgownie, Mount Warrigal, Coniston, Oak Flats, Albion Park and Woonona. She graduated from the University of Wollongong and obtained employment with Legal Aid in Wollongong. Ms Foreman later obtained employment at Dribbus Kovacevic Lawyers in that city. She then worked for R&M Legal (now known as McNamara & Associates) in Nowra before establishing her own firm in Wollongong where she practised extensively.
	
	
	The Crown case is that Ms Foreman died as the result of a deliberately lit fire in her home in Corrimal at approximately 2.30am on 27 October 2011. The accused is alleged to have been involved with his co-accused in the planning, preparation and commission of this offence. It appears that he had been in a relationship from time to time with Ms Foreman for a number of years. The accused's semen was recovered from Ms Foreman at a post mortem examination.
	
	
	The crime is said to have generated significant local publicity. I have not been furnished with the details of that publicity or any evidence to establish it. However, it is not in contest that the events that give rise to these proceedings have attracted considerable interest and notoriety in the Wollongong area and the surrounding districts. The accused contends that the publicity that has already been generated in Wollongong is such that it is unlikely that any, or many, prospective jurors will not already have heard of the case and, by implication, will have formed views concerning it. The present application is based upon the proposition that this will not also be the case with respect to potential jurors in the Sydney area. The accused contends that he will be unlikely to receive a fair trial in Wollongong in these circumstances because of the suspected predisposition of jurors drawn from the local area where media interest in the death of Ms Foreman has been extreme, and where she was a well-known identity.
	
	
	The accused also contends that the publicity during the trial favours a change of venue. It is not clear to me why that should be so, given that nothing that is reported in either location will extend beyond what falls out in evidence during the trial, and that no obvious distinction between publicity of the trial in Wollongong as opposed to Sydney has been suggested or established.
	
	
	Wendy Evans is also charged with the murder of Ms Foreman. Ms Evans has pleaded guilty to that charge and is due to be sentenced by me. Ms Foreman and Ms Evans were known to each other professionally and in due course developed a personal friendship. It appears that a number of witnesses who are likely to be called at the trial are employees of the Department of the Attorney General in Wollongong who will both know Ms Evans and will have also known Ms Foreman. Several other people in the Wollongong legal fraternity are likely to become witnesses at the trial. The accused's solicitor Benjamin Archbold has sworn a detailed affidavit setting out the names of these people and to some extent the nature of their relationship with the deceased and with each other.
	
	
	Although no submissions were made about the significance of these potential witnesses or of their relationship with the deceased, there appears to be some concern that their evidence should not be given in the local professional environment in which they practise or circulate. The burden of this evidence would appear to be that the pool of local citizens available to be empanelled as jurors from Wollongong would be more likely to include people who knew the nominated witnesses than an equivalent group of potential jurors drawn from Sydney. That presumably carries with it the potential problem that the number of panels from whom the final jury might be drawn will have to be larger, with the associated prospect that it will not be possible to empanel sufficient jurors with no connection to the accused or these witnesses even from an expanded pool.
	
	
	The accused contends in these circumstances that he will not receive an unprejudiced or fair trial and that the change of venue from Wollongong to Sydney is likely to alleviate that concern.
	


Consideration


	
	It is uncontroversial that it falls to the Attorney General to fix the place of trials. The Crown contends that this is a right with which a court ought not lightly to interfere. It is a matter in which the onus for a change of venue lies heavily upon the accused: R v Dorrington [1969] 1 NSWR 381; R v Brewer [2000] NSWCCA 488. R v Cattell (1967) 86 W.N. (Pt 1) 391 is an example of a case in which a change of venue was ordered. Sugarman JA commenced his judgment at 392 with a brief statement of some considerations to which it is convenient to refer:
	


""This is an exceptional case. First, there are absent from it those considerations which are usually regarded as requiring or making it desirable that a trial for crime should take place in a particular locality, notwithstanding that that course may involve certain disadvantages to the accused person such as those flowing from local discussion of the crime or local publicity given to the committal proceedings, which disadvantages, it is thought, are met by a just expectation that the jury will perform their duty in accordance with their oaths.""


	
	The circumstances that made that case exceptional consisted in the fact that the accused was charged with offences alleging that he fraudulently issued a prospectus that ultimately attracted considerable public subscriptions from the Newcastle area. The companies concerned were well established there. A significant proportion of those who took up subscriptions in the companies, and who consequently lost their entire investment, came from the Newcastle area. As his Honour described it, ""because of the companies' local associations and business activities, the value of such local investment was out of proportion to the population of the locality."" His Honour went on to observe at 393 that:
	


""…[o]f all recent company failures it is thought that the failure of this group would be best remembered in Newcastle, and it may be difficult to obtain in Newcastle a jury of twelve persons, none of whom was personally affected, or had a relative, friend or acquaintance who was affected, in his pocket, by such failure. No doubt there were investors in these companies in Sydney also; but Newcastle is a much smaller community and because of this, and of the disproportion earlier mentioned, the chances of encountering such persons as I have referred to on a Newcastle jury are so much the greater.""


	
	It is implicit in the opening remarks of Sugarman JA, and it is not in contest, that I should assume that jurors drawn from the community, wherever that might be, will perform their task as jurors in accordance with their oath to consider the evidence impartially and assess it in accordance with directions that they are given. McHugh J made some relevant remarks in this context in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31] as follows:
	


""The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials. It is of course true that, if a jury persists in returning a verdict that is contrary to law, the trial judge must accept it. But that only means in Lord Mansfield's words that, although '[i]t is the duty of the Judge... to tell the jury how to do right... they have it in their power to do wrong'.""


	
	The Victorian Court of Appeal considered issues of the kind arising for consideration in this case in The Queen v Boriss Vjestica [2008] VSCA 47. The informative discussion in the judgment of Maxwell P at [2]-[36] should be noted.
	
	
	The accused's principal contention in this case is based upon the proposition that any steps that can be taken either to eliminate or to reduce the risk that they will not or may not perform in accordance with their oath should be taken if it is possible to do so.
	
	
	I am informed that a substantial portion of the Crown case will rely upon telephone intercepts. The Crown contends that to that extent at least the prospect of juror partiality is neutralised by the impersonal nature of the evidence.
	
	
	The accused contends that one or more of the selected jurors will either know, or know of, him or Ms Foreman. The Crown's response is that such a concern overlooks what will inevitably be the instruction given to the panel in waiting concerning the identity of all accused, as well as witnesses nominated as likely to be called in the trial. The Crown also contends that in a city the size of Wollongong it will be entirely feasible to empanel a jury that has no disentitling connection with or knowledge of any party or prospective witnesses.
	
	
	The Crown also submits that pre-trial publicity is a modern fact of life. Jurors are regularly warned about disregarding information that they may have gleaned from sources at large in the community before the case commences. This case is no different.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown reiterates the desirability of crimes committed in a particular community being tried in that community. In the absence of exceptional or poisonous circumstances, such as those identified in Cattell, there is no warrant for removing the trials to Sydney.
	
	
	It does seem to me that there are no circumstances of the kind that Sugarman JA referred to in Cattell that apply by analogy here. The burden of that decision was that a general mood of ill feeling towards the accused might have existed in Newcastle because he was allegedly associated with a corporate structure that failed, which directly affected the financial health of a large portion of the local population from which the jury was to be drawn. Perhaps implicit in the reasoning in that case is the notion that some potential jurors might have been so affected or influenced by the activities of the companies with which the accused was associated that calls for impartiality may inadvertently, or even consciously, have gone unheeded.
	
	
	Be that as it may, there does not appear to me to be anything particularly exceptional about the circumstances of the present case. The touchstone of the accused's contentions is fundamentally that it will not be possible to find a jury in Wollongong, drawn from those who are called for service when the trial commences, who actually heed the trial judge's exhortations to withdraw from the case if they have any reason to suspect that they may know someone who is likely to be called as a witness, or have a strong or unshakable view about some aspect of the case. If that concern materialised, a change of venue may be required. However, it is simply not possible to test it in advance. Unless or until that unlikely situation presented itself, I consider that it is necessary to proceed upon the assumption that prospective jurors will listen to and abide by the directions and instructions they are given. Any different assumption is clearly inimical to the current traditional and widespread use and selection of juries to hear criminal trials in the first place, whatever the particular venue may be.
	
	
	It seems to me that there is no proper basis for a change of venue in this case. Accordingly I consider that the accused's notice of motion should be dismissed.

2762781,Fysh v R [2013] NSWCCA 284,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
2HOEBEN CJ at CL:Trial and sentenceThe applicant for leave to appeal stood trial between 15 October 2012 and 14 November 2012 before McCallum J and a jury with respect to four counts of insider trading under ss 1043A(1)(c) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  On 14 November 2012 the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on the first two counts and guilty with respect to the third and fourth counts.
3Counts 3 and 4 alleged that in early December 2007, while in possession of inside information which was not generally available concerning Queensland Gas Company Ltd (QGC), the applicant purchased shares in QGC in the amount of 240,000 and 10,000 respectively.
4On 19 December 2012 the applicant was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with respect to count 3, to commence on 11 December 2012 and expire on 10 December 2014.  On count 4 the applicant was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, to commence on 11 December 2012 and expire on 10 June 2014.  Her Honour ordered that the applicant was to be released on recognisance after serving 12 months of imprisonment.
5The applicant sought leave to appeal from his conviction on the following grounds:
Ground 1:  The verdicts were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, because it was not open to the jury to be satisfied that at the time that he purchased the QGC shares, item (f) of the information in MFI 4 was possessed by Mr Fysh.
Ground 2:  The verdicts were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, because it was not open to the jury to be satisfied that at the time that he purchased the QGC shares, Mr Fysh possessed the substance of the information in MFI 4 taken as a whole or in combination, in that he did not possess the information in item (f) of MFI 4.
Ground 3:  The verdicts were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, because it was not open to the jury to be satisfied that the information in MFI 4 was material in the sense that if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares.
6The application for leave to appeal and the appeal were heard by this Court on 17 July 2013.  At the conclusion of the appeal, the Court made the following orders:
1. Leave to appeal granted.
2. Appeal allowed.
3. The conviction on the counts, the subject of the appeal, be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.
7The Court advised that it would provide reasons at a later date.  These are the reasons.

11MFI 4, to which reference was made in the Grounds of Appeal, was in the following form:
""Counts 3 and 4 - QGC PARTICULARS OF INFORMATION
Purchase of shares in QGC between 2 and 8 December 2007.
The Information
(a) The Team had identified using CSG to produce LNG as a potentially economically viable means of providing BG Group with a source of LNG in the Asia Pacific region.
(b) The Team identified four companies, Origin Energy Ltd (Origin), Santos Ltd (Santos), QGC and Arrow as holding over 90 percent of the CSG resources in Eastern Australia and had clearly linked an entry position for BG Group into Eastern Australia to an M & A, a ""farm-in"" or ""partnering"" with one of these four.  
(c) BG Group's Portfolio Development Committee had, in September 2007, approved funding for the Team to pursue its strategic plan to deliver a material CSG entry for BG Group into Eastern Australia within the next 12 months.
(d) BG  Group had commissioned Advanced Resources International (ARI) to assess the size and quality of CSG resources in Eastern Australia.  ARI's assessment was that Eastern Australia had two world class CSG plays which were comparable to the United States San Juan Basin CBM (Coal Bed Methane, another name for CSG), namely the areas of the Undulla Nose/Walloon Fairway in the Surat Basin and Comet Ridge in the Bowen Basin.
(e) The Team's assessment of the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of the holdings of Origin, Santos, QGC and Arrow in the Walloon Fairway and Comet Ridge areas was 28.2 trillion cubic feet (tcf) for Origin, 13.6 tcf for QGC, 10.2 tcf for Santos and 6.9 tcf for Arrow.  Arrow's holdings were of significantly inferior quality to that of QGC.
(f) The Team had prepared evaluations of QGC and Arrow in which the Net Asset Valuation (NAV) of QGC was more than 2 ½ times its then current share price on the ASX while the NAV for Arrow was about half its then current share price on the ASX.
(g) The head of the Team, David Maxwell, had concluded that the successful companies in Queensland involved in CSG were those with acreage that had unlocked the science of converting CSG to LNG for that acreage and that Arrow appeared to be the poorest in that regard.
(h) Mr Maxwell had been working on a ""Queensland opportunity"" and from 2 December 2007 would be travelling to Australia and for the following two weeks would be locked into leading (and capturing) the Queensland opportunity involving an M & A, farm-in or strategic alliance.
(i) It was reasonable to conclude that the ""Queensland opportunity"" was in respect of such a proposed relationship between BG Group and QGC.""
12Much of the relevant law and facts were not in dispute at the hearing.  In relation to the law, it was not in dispute that the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt four elements of the offence being relevantly for Count 3 (and applied in equivalent terms for Count 4, save for the dates and quantum of shares acquired).
1. Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that, between 2 and 7 December 2007, the accused acquired 240,000 shares in Queensland Gas Company Ltd.
2. If so, has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did so intentionally.
3. Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he acquired the shares, the accused possessed inside information.
4. Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew or ought reasonably to have known that:
 (i) The information was not ""generally available""; and
(ii) If the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a ""material effect"" on the price or value of shares in QGC?
13The applicant and the Crown agreed upon a large number of the relevant facts which were set out in the Joint Statement of Agreed Facts, which was provided to the jury (Exhibit A).  For example, it was not in dispute that the applicant had bought the shares at the times alleged.  The applicant's defence focused on whether he possessed all of the information alleged in MFI 4 and whether the information that he did possess at the time of purchasing the QGC shares was ""material"" in the relevant sense so as to be ""inside information"".
14Two of the critical issues at the hearing were:
(a) Whether the applicant was required to possess each and every item of the information set out in MFI 4 and whether the Crown had proved the necessary possession; and
(b) Whether the Crown had proved that the information possessed by the applicant was material in the sense that if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of the QGC shares.
15In relation to the first of these issues, her Honour determined that the Crown was required to prove that the applicant possessed the body of information, that is, all of the information set out in MFI 4, taken in combination.  As her Honour directed the jury, the test was whether the applicant possessed the substance of that information taken as a whole, or in combination, except any part of the information that the jury considered made no real difference.
16No complaint was made by either side in relation to her Honour's determination in this regard or the directions given to the jury by her Honour.  The applicant's complaint was that the jury could not have been satisfied that he did possess the body of information set out in MFI 4 because they could not have been satisfied as to his possession of Item (f), which was an important part of the information.
Agreed Facts
17Exhibit A was a Statement of Agreed Facts.  In order to understand the applicant's submission, it is necessary to understand the factual background and what issues were in dispute.  The following facts formed part of Exhibit A and were agreed.
18The applicant held a Bachelor of Science and a PhD in physics from Monash University.  He was employed by BHP in various capacities after leaving university and rose to the position of Commercial Manager Asia (CMA).  In 1998 he joined the BG Group and was responsible for business development in Asia generally.  He was a member of the Group Executive Committee of BG (""the GEC"") which was the senior management group within BG.  
19BG was a large international energy company with a particular focus on gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Its head office was in the United Kingdom at Thames Valley Park, Reading and it was listed on both the London Stock Exchange and the US Over-the-Counter Market.  It was one of the top ten listed UK companies and for the year ending 31 December 2007 had a total revenue of over 8.3 billion pounds, a total operating profit of over 3.2 billion pounds and a market capitalisation of approximately 35 billion pounds.  BG had business operations in 27 countries over five continents.
20The GEC was responsible for the overall general management of BG's business and reported to the Board.  In 2007 Sir Frank Chapman was the Chief Executive and Executive Director of BG.  The GEC delegated functions to the Portfolio Development Committee and the Investment Committee.  It approved major investments up to a certain value.  Projects above that value had to be approved by BG's Board.  A new business opportunity in BG became designated as a ""Project"" and had a project name allocated only once it reached the stage where BG had decided to actively pursue it.  Projects that needed to be kept confidential were given a coded project name.
21For some years before 2006, it had been a goal of BG to enter the LNG business in the Asia Pacific region.  In 2006 BG established an Asia Pacific LNG business development team (the Team) based in Singapore.  David Maxwell (Mr Maxwell) was appointed to head the Team, which included two senior managers, Gary Thompson and Jim Seaton, each of whom had the title Vice President - Business Development.  They both reported to Mr Maxwell.
22In about mid 2007, the Team identified an emerging opinion within the market that coal seam gas (CSG) also known as Coal Bed Methane (CBM) and Coal Seam Methane (CSM) may be able to be used to produce LNG, although what was involved in the process was not completely understood within BG at that time.  Mr Maxwell proposed that using CSG as feedstock for the production of LNG should be investigated further.
23From its review of publicly available information, the Team identified Eastern Australia as a possible source of CSG, with four companies holding the majority of CSG resources - Arrow Energy NL (Arrow), Queensland Gas Company Ltd (QGC), Santos Ltd (Santos) and Origin Energy Ltd (Origin).
24On 12 June 2007 BG held its annual strategic review at which Mr Maxwell gave a presentation which identified CSG to LNG as one of a number of ideas that could deliver BG an Asia Pacific source of supply of LNG.  The applicant attended that presentation.
25From 1997 the applicant operated an account with Goldman Sachs JB Were (GSJBW) stockbroking in Melbourne, through which he traded securities on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  Between 1997 and 2007 the applicant built up a portfolio of industrial and resources stocks listed on the ASX that he traded regularly through GSJBW.  Without setting out the various trades in detail, it would be fair to say that the applicant's share trading was substantial with large sums of money involved.  His share trading during 2006 is illustrative.  In January 2006 he held 1,100,000 shares in TYC worth $968,000.  In May 2006 he held 400,000 in MCR worth $336,000 and 600,000 shares in INP worth $192,000.  In May 2006 he sold his entire holding in TYC.  In the same month, he purchased 500,000 shares in Elk Petroleum, an Australian oil company at a total purchase price of $325,000.  He sold out of Elk in July and August 2006 with a loss of around $140,000.  In September 2006 he sold his holdings in MCR for a total sum of $713,790 and purchased an additional 708,145 shares in INP at a cost of around of $493,000.  Throughout 2007 the applicant gradually purchased an additional 2,591,855 shares in INP investing a further $1,250,121.
26On 14 June 2007 the applicant instructed GSJBW to purchase 100,000 Arrow shares at up to $2.85 per share.  100,000 Arrow shares were transferred to the applicant on 19 October 2007.  On 18 June 2007 the applicant placed an order to buy a further 150,000 Arrow shares.  This trade was completed on 21 June 2007.  
27On or about 1 August 2007 Mr Maxwell spoke to the applicant by telephone about how to get BG interested in business development opportunities.  After the meeting, Mr Maxwell sent the applicant an email attaching a Macquarie report on the Gladstone LNG facility and referring to ""the big four (Santos, Origin, QGC and Arrow)"" and noted that they held ""90 percent of the 2P of 5178PJ (bcf)"".  On 9 August 2007 the applicant sent an email to the BG GEC containing an article about Australian CSM which referred in particular to Arrow and QGC and copied it to Mr Maxwell.  In August 2007 Mr Maxwell and the Team prepared a ""Traffic Light Paper"" (TLP) to seek approval and funding to assess the potential for converting CSG to LNG and also to review and identify opportunities for BG to enter the CSG business in Eastern Australia.
28On 17 August 2007 Mr Maxwell emailed his draft TLP to the applicant.  The applicant emailed back comments about the draft proposal and on 19 August 2007 Mr Maxwell thanked him for the comments and told him that the TLP had been amended to pick up most of them.  The Portfolio Development Committee approved the recommendation in the TLP and agreed that Mr Maxwell should define the strategy and business case for CSM in Eastern Australia ""and identify mature BE options to deliver a material business which should be presented to the Committee for consideration in due course"".
29The applicant was one of five people who received an email from Mr Maxwell on 11 September 2007 advising that the Australia CSM work was approved by the Portfolio Development Committee.  In the email Mr Maxwell said that he saw Origin as a potential feedstock supplier to a CSM LNG project but that the other three (Santos, QGC and Arrow) had a higher proportion of their gas uncontracted.  In due course Mr Maxwell was authorised to engage Advanced Resources International (ARI) to assess the size and quality of the CSG resource in Eastern Australia and to rank the acreage held by the companies with material CSG positions.  Core Collaborative (Core) was engaged to review the market and provide economic modelling.  
30On 26 and 27 September 2007 Messrs Seaton and Thompson met with representatives of ARI and Core in Singapore to receive the interim results provided by ARI, which they passed onto Mr Maxwell the next day.  On 18 October 2007 Mr Maxwell emailed the applicant to request a meeting between the applicant, Mr Thompson and Mr Seaton.  In the email Mr Maxwell told the applicant that Messrs Thompson and Seaton ""are in Thames Valley Park next week for internal reviews on the CSG work which is going very well.  Some very interesting insights are emerging from the technical work and we have identified a valuable opportunity which we are now moving quickly on.  I have suggested to Gary and Jim that they spend some time with you sharing the work and insight/results"".
31On 23 October 2007 at BG's head office in the United Kingdom, Messrs Thompson and Seaton met with the applicant.
32On 14 November 2007 BG's Mergers and Acquisitions Group assigned a confidential code name ""Project Honey"" to the negotiations with QGC.  On 27 November 2007 Mr Maxwell had dinner with the applicant in Singapore at Mr Maxwell's request.  From 27 November 2007 to 2 December 2007 Mr Maxwell and the applicant exchanged a number of emails. 
33Relevant emails were:
28 November 2007 - Mr Maxwell (from Singapore) to the applicant with the subject ""Queensland CSG Resources"" attaching three Powerpoint slides.
29 November 2007 -  Applicant (from India) to Mr Maxwell (in Singapore) with the subject ""Queensland CSG Resources"" replying to Mr Maxwell's email of 28 November 2007.  
30 November 2007 - Applicant (from India) to Mr Maxwell (in Singapore) with the subject ""A couple of things"".
2 December 2007 - Mr Maxwell (from Singapore) to the applicant (in the UK) in response to the applicant's email of 30 November 2007.
2 December 2007 - Mr Maxwell (from Singapore) to the applicant (in the UK) attaching a copy of the presentation entitled ""Eastern Australia Coal Seam Gas (CSG) - ARI Technical Overview Presentation 25/26 October 2007"".
2 December 2007 - Mr Maxwell (from Singapore) to the applicant (in the UK) with the subject ""Re Queensland CSG Resources"" in response to the applicant's email of 29 November 2007.
2 December 2007 - Applicant (from the UK) to Mr Maxwell with the subject ""CBM"".
34On 2 December 2007 at approximately 11.22pm (GMT) (10.22am, 3 December 2007 Australian Eastern Daylight Time), the applicant's stockbroker received a telephone call from him (in the UK) which instructed him to buy 240,000 QGC shares at $3.20 per share.  240,000 QGC shares were bought on the ASX the same day and the applicant was notified.  Settlement of the QGC share purchase took place on 6 December 2007.
35On 3 December 2007 at approximately 10.39pm (GMT) (9.40am on 4 December 2007 Australian Eastern Daylight Time), the applicant's stockbroker received an email from him in the UK giving instructions to acquire a further 10,000 QGC shares at up to $3.25 per share.  Settlement of the QGC share purchase occurred on 7 December 2007.
36On 3 December 2007 negotiations commenced between BG representatives (Mr Maxwell, Mr Seaton and Mr Allen) and QGC representatives (Mr Cottee and others) regarding a proposal that (among other things) BG take an equity position in QGC of around 9.9 percent.  The negotiations continued over some weeks.  
37On 8 December 2007 the Chairman of the Investment Committee sent an email to certain members of the GEC, including the applicant, attaching amongst other things a ""Project Honey"" Board pre-read for discussion.  On 13 December 2007 the BG Board discussed ""Project Honey"" and referred it to the Investment Committee.  On 16 January 2008 the Investment Committee resolved to recommend the deal between BG and QGC to the Chairman's Committee.  On 21 January 2008 the applicant was added to BG's project list for ""Project Honey"".  On 29 January 2008 the Chairman's Committee approved the deal and authorised the Investment Committee to approve the final terms.  
38At some stage before the end of January 2008, the applicant informed Graham Vinter, BG's general counsel, that he held QGC shares.
39On 1 February 2008 at 10.30am (Australian Eastern Daylight Time) the ASX announced a trading halt for shares of QGC at the request of the company pending a company announcement.  The last traded price of QGC shares on the ASX before the closure was $3.42.
40Three announcements were released to the Australian market; one on 1 February 2008 by QGC, another on 3 February 2008 by QGC and an Investor Briefing by BG on 4 February 2008 prior to the Australian market opening.  The announcement by BG and QGC to the ASX concerned:
(a) An $870 million strategic alliance or joint venture which included BG acquiring a 9.9 percent shareholding in QGC at $3.07 per share and a direct ownership interest of up to 30 percent of QGC's CSG assets, some of which was contingent on the construction of an LNG facility or the certification of 7000 petajoules of proven and probable (2P) gas reserves; and
(b) A report that QGC currently had more than 7,255 petajoules in reserves and contingent resources as assessed by independent certifiers Netherland Sewell & Associates Inc.
41When the market opened on the ASX at 10am on 4 February 2008 following the release of the three announcements, the QGC share price rose.  QGC commenced trading at $3.90 and went as high as $4.14 during the day.  On 28 October 2008 BG announced to the market an on-market takeover of QGC at $5.75 per share effective 15 December 2008.  On 19 November 2008 the applicant sold his entire holding in QGC on the ASX (295,000 shares at $5.75 per share) accepting BG's on-market offer at a time when it was clear that BG would proceed to compulsory acquisition of QGC.
Evidence at trial
42Mr Maxwell gave evidence in the Crown case.  He said that he had been recruited by BG in order to grow the BG gas and LNG business with a particular focus on LNG in the Asia Pacific region.  The applicant was a senior executive in BG.  Mr Maxwell viewed him as a colleague and while he had no direct reporting relationship with him, the applicant was always supportive of what the Team were trying to do.  Other senior executives in BG encouraged Mr Maxwell and team members to speak with the applicant because he was probably the person sitting around the GEC table that had the best understanding of Australia.
43Mr Maxwell explained how the thinking of the Team developed in September and October 2007.  He said that ARI was engaged to ""interpret the technical results that were, the technical information that was publicly available on the resources we were looking at and their techniques and own experience and that allowed them to interpret those results and to then determine in their view what the size of the resources might be and quality of the resources might be and separately we, as a result of the confidentiality agreement we put in place with QGC, ARI were able to access some technical data that QGC had made available to ARI for ARI to then analyse.""  (AB 2 T219.37)
44With respect to Santos, Mr Maxwell said:
""The interest in Project Corn was declining for two reasons; one was the liability issues associated with the Indonesian mudslide and secondly, the more we looked at the resources that QGC, Origin and Arrow had in addition to the resources that Santos had we started to learn that some of those resources were better than we had previously expected them to be and some were not as good as we might otherwise have expected them to be.""  (AB2, T221.34)
And further:
""I think it became clear to us, or it did become clear to us, that Origin and QGC and Santos had the best quality resources and Arrow resources in terms of quality were not as good as the resources that the other three companies had.""
45In September 2007 BG head office asked the Team to do an evaluation of Arrow as the possibility of a 17 percent shareholding in that company had arisen.  In response, on 2 October 2007 Mr Maxwell sent the Arrow Overview Presentation Pack.  On 18 October 2007 Mr Maxwell sent an email to BG head office indicating that the Team felt that the best fit and most doable option was QGC.  The team had prepared a Queensland Opportunity Pack (the QGC Pack).  Mr Maxwell described the QGC Pack:
""A document setting out in a summary form the current thinking of the team on the QGC opportunity and flagging up or identifying the value proposition that we felt QGC could represent for the company and identifying some of the issues that would need to be addressed if we were to pursue that opportunity.""  (AB2, T258.22)
46In late October 2007, the Team received the final ARI report.  As a result of ARI's findings, the team concluded:
""The opportunity that we were or that we had identified in QGC was firming as the best opportunity for the company.""  (AB2, T258.20)
47Mr Maxwell and the Team summarised ARI's findings in the ""ARI Technical Overview Presentation 25/26 October 2007"".
48Mr Maxwell arranged for Messrs Thompson and Seaton to meet with the applicant at the BG head office and share their insights and results.  Mr Maxwell said:
""I had been encouraged by other members of the Group Executive and people to whom I had reported to work with, to seek the support and work with Mr Fysh because of his business development expertise and his Australian background and understanding of the Australian economic and oil gas circumstances.""  (AB2, T260.47)
49He said:
""I always found Mr Fysh to be very helpful and that is the reason why I continued to communicate with Mr Fysh.  And at the appropriate time when we were coming up to key milestones seek, seek his view.""  (AB2, T261.09)
50Mr Maxwell gave evidence regarding a meeting that took place in November 2007 between BG senior management and Mr Cottee of QGC at BG's head office in the United Kingdom.  Mr Maxwell facilitated the meeting:
""The BG team management that met with Mr Cottee, after the meeting, encouraged us to continue to progress as quickly as we could, the negotiations with Mr Cottee and his team.  With a view to establishing a set of agreements which we could take back to BG Group for BG Group - or recommend to BG Group senior management, the board, for approval.  Approval to acquire an interest in Queensland Gas and an approval to acquire from Queensland Gas interest in certain assets that they held."" (AB2, T270.11)
51Mr Maxwell said that the email chain between himself and the applicant on 23 November 2007 was indicative of a meeting he was trying to arrange with the applicant because:
""It had been announced that we were going - my line of reporting was to move from Mr Friedrich to Mr Martin Heuston and there was a situation which I saw emerging where Mr Fysh had responsibility for the geographic region of South-East Asia, my team had responsibility for the business development aspects in South-East Asia around gas and LNG, which reported in through a different senior executive and I wanted to have a conversation with Stuart around that.  That was the main reason for my wanting to meet with him.""  (AB1 p 285, AB2 T70.39)
52In late November Mr Maxwell met with the applicant in Singapore.  Amongst other things, they talked about:
 ""... the business that we were pursuing in LNG and coal seam gas in Queensland, but we didn't talk about the intimate details of that, that business ...  We talked more about why QGC was the right opportunity for us to pursue, given the context - given the analysis that we had been undertaking, but we didn't talk about the details of that analysis.  It was just that QGC was the better opportunity for us of the four that we had contemplated back in the middle of the year.""  (AB2, T272.14)
53On 27 November 2007 Mr Maxwell emailed the applicant regarding their discussion the evening before.  In that email Mr Maxwell wrote ""We'll send you a slide or two on the CSG resources ownership allocation for info"".  Mr Maxwell gave evidence that he was making ""a reference to the share of CSG resources held by the four main companies in Queensland and I would send some information on that to Stuart Fysh"" (AB2, T274.20).  Mr Maxwell said that he sent the email to the applicant because ""it was an element of the conversation that we had the night before and I was just sending information in support of comments that I had made to Mr Fysh at the time"".  This was at a time when the emails which formed part of the agreed facts were passing between Mr Maxwell and the applicant.  In relation to the dinner in Singapore, Mr Maxwell said:
""There was discussion at the dinner in Singapore of QGC versus the other opportunities that we had, sorry, there was discussion in Singapore of QGC relative to the other coal seam gas companies ...  Why QGC was a good opportunity for BG Group or why that was the opportunity we were pursuing but I can't recall at this point in time any further details of the QGC opportunities at the dinner, at the meeting in Singapore on that evening.""  (AB2, T278.15)
54Under cross-examination Mr Maxwell said that there were some members of the GEC who knew about ""Project Honey"" who were not on the distribution list.  He agreed that the applicant's name was not on the distribution list. (AB2, T295.49)
55Mr Maxwell agreed that in August 2007 the team was still looking at ""Project Corn"" (Santos) as one of the options.  At that time the team was also meeting with a company called ""LNG Limited"", a mid/small scale LNG company looking at a CSM to LNG project in Australia.  Nothing came of that contact.  
56Mr Maxwell agreed that the TLP did not particularly focus upon Arrow and QGC.  At that time, the team were pretty much at the beginning of the five stages towards possible approval of the project (AB2, T351.20, 353.47).  As of that time (September 2007), he agreed that the team was still conducting a scoping exercise as to whether CSG to LNG was worth doing.  He explained that the reason he was asked to look at the possibility of BG purchasing a stake in Arrow in September 2007 was that this was offered by a company that had a large shareholding in Arrow.  He agreed that by the end of November 2007 he needed to be conscious of the confidentiality arrangements regarding ""Project Honey"".
57Mr Maxwell agreed that when questioned in December 2008 about the meeting with the applicant in Singapore in November 2007, he could have said ""It can't have been very eventful because I can't remember the dinner"".  In relation to the apparent discrepancy between what he had said in December 2008 and what he said at trial, Mr Maxwell said:
""If that is what the transcript says I guess that is what I said.  I think memories get jolted at times and other things come into your mind and you suddenly remember other aspects.""  (AB2, T363.13)
58Mr Maxwell accepted that in December 2008, when asked by ASIC examiners about whether anything was said about QGC in the course of the Singapore meeting, he responded:
""I can't, I can't recall and this came up in an internal meeting, an internal discussion last Friday.""
Mr Maxwell agreed that he was on oath to tell the truth when questioned by ASIC and had been doing his best to recall the matter (AB2, T366.45, 367.10).
59Mr Maxwell agreed that when he was questioned by ASIC on 10 December 2008, it was much closer in time to the Singapore meeting with the applicant and that he did not claim to have a better recollection at trial than in December 2008.  Mr Maxwell said that he did not have a better memory of the meeting but that what he had done was review his notes and his calendar.  When questioned about these notes, Mr Maxwell agreed that he could not remember whether he ever had such notes [about the meeting with the applicant in Singapore] (AB2, T368.44).
60Mr Maxwell agreed that when questioned by ASIC about the Singapore dinner with the applicant, the thing he recalled about their conversation was organisational changes in BG.
61Mr Thompson gave evidence in the Crown case.  He said that the team headed by Mr Maxwell were looking at new business developments for BG in the Asia-Pacific region with a particular focus on Australian coal and gas.  During the first half of 2007, the focus was upon ""Project Corn"" (Santos) but that this opportunity began to fall away by mid 2007.
62He said that on 21 August 2007 he and Mr Maxwell met with Mr Cottee (QGC) in Brisbane.  The purpose of the meeting was to introduce BG and explore whether QGC might be interested in exploring CSG opportunities with BG.  After this meeting, the team began preparation of the TLP into which Mr Thompson had input.
63He said that Mr Maxwell presented the TLP on 10 September 2007 and as a result, BG expressed its support for the team to continue looking at CSG in Eastern Australia.  He and Mr Seaton met with ARI and Core to discuss their work.  The ARI consultants presented their initial assessment of the resource positions in the key places.  An Arrow shareholding was becoming a potential option and BG requested that an assessment of Arrow be done to consider whether they should take a shareholding in it.
64On 2 October 2007 the Team, including Mr Thompson, finalised the Arrow Pack, which consisted of ARI's findings.  It was intended that the Arrow Pack would be conveyed to BG head office.  ARI's findings indicated that there were four major resource holders being Santos, Origin, QGC and Arrow, who had a lot more gas than the team had initially thought existed.  The Team put together a similar summary for QGC called the ""QGC Pack"".
65In the last week of October 2007, he and Mr Seaton and ARI prepared the Arrow Overview Presentation based on ARI's final report.  Mr Maxwell emailed that PowerPoint presentation to the applicant on 2 December 2007.
66On 18 October 2007 Mr Maxwell arranged a meeting via email between Mr Seaton, Mr Thompson and the applicant.  The email said:
""Next week Gary and Jim are in TVP for internal reviews of the CSG work which is going very well ...  We feel we have identified a valuable opportunity ....  I have suggested to Gary and Jim that they spend some time with you sharing the work and insights/results.""
The applicant had responded:
""Looking forward to it, we will sort out a time.""
67Mr Thompson said that on 22 or 23 October 2007 he and Mr Seaton met with the applicant in his office at BG head office.  The subject matter of the discussion was CSG in Eastern Australia.   Messrs Thompson and Seaton briefed the applicant on the team's work.  Slides from both the QGC and Arrow Packs were presented to the applicant by placing the slides in their paper form on the table for discussion.
68The evidence of what happened at that meeting is of importance.  Mr Thompson's evidence concerning the meeting was:
""Q.  What do you recall the subject matter of your discussion was?A.   Yes, we were briefing him on our work on coal seam gas in Eastern Australia and we presented some slides from both the QGC pack and the Arrow pack in our discussion.
Q.  By ""presented"" what do you mean?A.  Just had them on the table for discussion points.
Q.  In a paper form like they are in the bundle?A.  In a paper form, yes.
Q.  Did you say you had some slides?A.  Yes we did have a few, like when we present it to other members of the Group Executive ...  When we went through the entire presentation we had some loose slides on the table for referring to in conversation. 
...
Q.  I appreciate that you were relating background, in effect?A.  Yes and I provided an overview of the ARI work and I said words to the effect that it shows that Santos, Origin and QGC have the better acreage of the four main players.
Q.  Which four?A.  Santos, Origin, QGC and Arrow.  That Arrow's acreage was on the margin of the play.
Q.  On the what?A.  On the edge of the play, on the edge of the fairway.  Not in the sweet spots of the fairway.  And that there is considerably more gas than we had originally thought was there.
...
A.  Yes.  I also believe I made the comment when the two valuation slides were on the table, which Jim mainly spoke to, that QGC looked like a better opportunity than Arrow.
...
Q.  Are you saying that one of the documents, I think you referred to as the valuation page, is contained in that pack?A.  Yes, slide 9 of that pack, which is page 162.  (This was a slide relating to Arrow.)
Q.  Page 162?A.  That's correct.  ...  I don't believe I specifically spoke to this slide, as in terms of referring to numbers or figures on this particular slide.
Q.  What about anyone else?A.  Jim went through the slide.
Q.  By ""went through"" do you mean he said things about them?A.  I believe so.  It is some time ago.
HER HONOUR:  Five years to be precise, or four years and 364 days.
CROWN:  Q:  And then you also, I think, referred a little while ago to the valuation sheet or page from the QGC pack; is that right?A.  That's correct.
Q.  Look at the pages which you've previously examined, starting at page 175, please?A.  I have the papers in question.
Q.  Can you see in the bundle, following page 175, the page which you described as a valuation page or sheet, the slide?A.  177 (This was a QGC slide).
Q.  What happened, if anything, in relation to that page or slide during the meeting you've described?A.  Again, it was referred to in the meeting by Mr Seaton as one of the slides that he had brought with him and in front of him, yes I didn't specifically talk to the slide myself.
Q.  You?A.  I did not specifically talk to this slide myself.
Q.  Thankyou.  Do you remember anything else that took place during that meeting?A.  Stuart offered some views on how we could, sorry, Mr Fysh put some views on how we could sell the opportunity internally.""  (AB 2, T386.24-389.50)
...
""Q.  Do you recall whether or not any other slides or pages from these packs were referred to during that meeting?A.  I don't specifically recall any other slides.
Q.  Do you recall anything else about what was said during the meeting?A.  In the dialogue on the size of the resource, I recall Mr Fysh questioning is there really that much gas there?  I recall him being enthusiastic and supportive of the opportunity for BG.
Q.  Which opportunity was that?A.  Coal seam gas in Eastern Australia.""  (AB 2, T391.3)
69Mr Thompson said that on 25 and 26 October 2007 he, Mr Seaton and Mr Kuskra (of ARI) went to BG head office to brief the executive members on CSG and gain general support to pursue the opportunity of CSG in Eastern Australia.  Mr Kuskra presented ARI's findings to the BG executive.  He said that around November 2007 a transaction team was specifically set up (called ""Project Honey"") to look at a targeted entry into CSG.  He said that in 2007, he was asked to conduct a due diligence on Project Honey in Brisbane and out in the field and to assess their operational practice in anticipation of a potential future transaction (AB 2, T414).
70In cross-examination, Mr Thompson said that the Arrow pack was a quick estimate of the opportunity.  ""It was done very quickly and it wasn't, it was a very preliminary assessment"" (AB 2, T419.8).  He agreed that ARI did its own independent drilling and went underground and collated publicly available information.  The same applied to the Core consultants.  
71Mr Thompson agreed that he did not remember which ARI slides he had on his person going into the meeting with the applicant, but recalled that he had some slides.  He acknowledged that he had previously indicated on oath that he was not sure which slides were shown to the applicant at the meeting.  Referring to the ASIC questioning, he said:
""I answered the questions put to me on the day, which is some time ago, to the best of my recollection.""  (AB 2, T242.30)
He said that although they talked more broadly than just Arrow and QGC, he had a general recollection of Arrow and QGC being discussed by Mr Seaton, but he could not recall specific details.  He agreed that his notes did not actually reflect the applicant being shown a slide.
72Mr Thompson agreed that he was involved in a discussion on 17 December 2007 within the BG Executive concerning Eastern Australia CSG to LNG in terms that included the ""recommendation"" and ""Executive summary"" in the briefing note of 17 December 2007 (Exhibit 2 - AB 1, p493-4).  Mr Thompson confirmed that the document was a paper, basically concluding the end of ""create phase"" work and recommending going into the ""assess phase"" work, seeking funding for the ""assess phase"" work and it followed readiness reviews which were held on 30 November upon completion of the ""create phase"" work (AB 2, T428.10).
73Mr Seaton gave evidence at trial.  He was part of the team under Mr Maxwell in 2006-2007.  He recalled that it became apparent that a shareholder in Arrow wanted to sell its shareholding to BG.  As a result, an evaluation was conducted as to whether BG would be interested in acquiring that package of shares.  He said that he was involved in the preparation of the evaluation, i.e. the Arrow pack.  He confirmed that the team specifically put the valuation figures together on slide 9 ""High Level Valuation"".  
74Mr Seaton said he was also involved in the preparation of a QGC pack because they were ""evaluating suitable entry opportunities to progress CSG to LNG.  We had evaluated the Arrow opportunity and QGC was the next in the sequence to evaluate"".  He said that both the Arrow and the QGC packs were strictly internal documents.
75Mr Seaton said that he adopted the habit of keeping a copy of the QGC slide pack inside the back of his ring bound notebook, because he was referring to the slide pack on a regular basis and it was very handy to have a hard copy around.  He could not recall whether he also kept the Arrow pack on him.
76Mr Seaton said that on 23 October 2007 he and Mr Thompson met with the applicant at BG's head office in Reading.  Mr Seaton had with him the QGC pack in his ring bound notebook.  Mr Seaton recalled that they discussed CSG business opportunities generally, but he could not recall the specifics of the conversation.
77In relation to this meeting, Mr Seaton said:
""Q.  You and Thompson went to head office?A.  Yes we did.
Q.  What happened in relation to your custom about carrying the QGC Pack around with you?A.  I still had it in the back of my notebook.
Q.  Did you meet at Reading in the BG head office with Mr Fysh?A.  Yes we did on 23 October.
Q.  And was Mr Thompson also there with you?A.  Yes he was.
Q.  What did you talk about?A.  We talked about business opportunities in Australia.  We also talked about the CSG opportunity.  I can't recall any specifics of the conversation.
Q.  Was there any attitude that Mr Fysh made plain in relation to what you were talking about?A.  My recollection is that Mr Fysh was very supportive, generally, of pursuing business developments in Australia and pursuing CSG to LNG opportunities.
...
Q.  Are you able to recall whether or not anything was shown to Mr Fysh when you met him?A.  I can't recall anything specifically in relation to Mr Fysh.""  (AB 2, T454.43-455.27)
""Q.  Was there any discussion about graphs in the meeting?A.  I can't recall a discussion about graphs.  I made the note.  
Q.  Was there any discussion about any particular companies?A.  I can't recall any specific discussions.
Q.  All right.  Insofar as you can recall the general subject matter, what was it that you were seeking from Mr Fysh if anything?A.  We were seeking his view on how best to present the CSG or LNG opportunity and potential questions that might be asked by the Executive.
...
Q.  And what was it that was presented?A.  It was the ARI Pack that was presented.
...
Q.  As suggesting that you had updated Mr Fysh in that regard; had you done that?A.  I can't recall specifically discussing QGC with Mr Fysh.""  (AB 2, T456.41-458.4)
78Mr Seaton was also involved in putting together the slide pack for the ARI Overview Presentation on 25 - 26 October 2007.  The purpose of the meeting was an internal technical review to enable BG (both executive and technical people) to have exposure to the ARI work.
79Mr Vinter gave evidence.  He was a member of the GEC and headed the legal function at BG.  He said that some time before the end of January 2008 or earlier, the applicant informed him that he held QGC shares.  His evidence was:
""I have been an investor for sometime in Australian Stocks.""  He may have said ""Energy Stocks"", and he made a joke that actually he probably earned more from his investment activity than he had through being employed by BG Group.  I remember that quite clearly.  He said that he had been following the no, he said actually that he had actually seen the prospects of a coal seam gas project providing gas to export project before BG had and had, as a result, acquired shares in QGC.  So at this stage we, he had been aware, that we were proposing a transaction with QGC and I said that we needed to just stop and consider about whether there might be an issue here in relation to insider dealing.""  (AB 2, T500.35)
80In relation to the applicant's knowledge of Project Honey, Mr Vinter said:
""A.  Yes, there was [a conversation], I don't think we went into any great detail but I do remember in response to a question I put to him that Stuart volunteered something along the lines of, yes, I think I probably asked him, ""What did you know in relation to Project Honey"", and Stuart replied, ""I knew the guys were doing something but not this""."" (AB 2, T502.20)
81Mr Vinter said that he did not act any further in relation to the information which the applicant had given him.  He said:
""The bald answer to that question is that's correct.  I did not act any further.  We concluded the conversation with words to the effect of ""I think you are the right side of the line"" and Stuart replied along the lines of ""That is what I think too"".""  (AB 2, T502.50)
82Under cross-examination, Mr Vinter agreed that he did not take notes of his conversation with the applicant in late January 2008 when the applicant disclosed his ownership of QGC shares.  As a member of the GEC, Mr Vinter could recall the investment committee meeting on 16 January 2008, but could not recall whether Sir Frank informed the GEC of Project Honey.  ""I don't specifically recall that.  I was already aware of the Project ... I don't specifically recall the resolution, but I do definitely recall that the Chairman's Committee was empowered to basically give us the final go ahead to sign documentation"" (AB 2, T508.40).
83Sir Frank Chapman gave evidence.  He said that the proposal about Project Honey was put before the Board at BG on 13 December 2007.  He received a CSG pre-read before the board meeting.  The applicant was copied into that email.  Having approved the concept, the Investment Committee were then responsible for completing and delivering the deal.  During December and January, negotiations about the form of the deal were proceeding.  In mid-January 2008, a meeting of the GEC took place.  The purpose of the meeting was to inform those GEC members who were not on the Project Honey list, what was shortly to happen between BG and QGC.  The applicant was present at that meeting.
84Mark Greenwood was an Equities Analyst at JP Morgan and gave evidence at the trial.  His function at JP Morgan was to evaluate oil and gas stocks in Australia and to forecast future earnings, estimate the value of those companies and provide investors with recommendations about whether they should effectively buy, sell or hold these stocks.  He said that in order to form opinions, analysts relied on publicly available information such as financial reports the companies had published historically, information available in the public arena and some data sources, including Bloombergs.   Analysts would synthesise information and put together forecasts of earnings to come up with a view on the stock.
85If the analysts saw a valuation that was significantly in excess of the share price, they would have a positive view of the stock, what they would call an ""overweight"" recommendation, but if the price of the stock was significantly greater than their inherent value, they would recommend that the clients sell the stock.  During the period January 2007 to February 2008, Mr Greenwood was responsible for following all publicly available information that would influence companies Woodside, Santos, Oil Search, AWE, Roc Oil and QGC.  Mr Greenwood would form views on the valuation and future earnings for those companies.
86In mid-2007, JP Morgan looked at QGC closely and regular reports were produced.  From then until January 2008, Mr Greenwood was not aware of information of BG having an interest in dealing with or going into some sort of joint venture with QGC.  When QGC announced its alliance with BG to commercialise CSG via LNG, Mr Greenwood produced a report dated 4 February 2008.
87Under cross-examination Mr Greenwood agreed that in a report dated 1 August 2007 he valued the QGC stock as ""underweight"".  By September 2007 his recommendation changed to ""overweight"" because from the material he analysed it could now be seen as a ""buy"" recommendation.  Mr Greenwood explained that JP Morgan's system was more of a relative recommendation than an absolute recommendation system, i.e. if the target price was more above the share price than it was below, that it would be considered relatively ""overweight"".
88When shown a JP Morgan document, Mr Greenwood agreed that as early as October 2006 it was known that there was growth of the CSG industry in Australia.  It was impressive and it was apparent that people had underestimated its impressive growth.  Mr Greenwood agreed that JP Morgan in the report compared the Australian CSG industry favourably to the US market.
89Mr Greenwood agreed that the 2006 JP Morgan document indicated that the enormous reserves potential, combined with reasonable economics would ensure CSM would fill the gaps between supply and demand.  Mr Greenwood explained that predicting a ""favourable future"" for CSG stock would depend upon the valuation of the stock, what share they had of reserves and what those reserves proved to be, their access to technology necessary to exploit the reserves and whether they had customers lined up and access to funding.  
90Daniel Dreyfus was a private client investment advisor at RBS Morgans.  He gave expert evidence on behalf of the Crown on the issue of the ""materiality"" of the information in MFI 4, i.e. that if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares.
91Mr Dreyfus gave evidence that his clientele ranged from very conservative people who had retired and were living off the earnings of particular investments, business people who were still working and in the accumulation phase of their savings, some younger people at the starting point of their investing careers and active traders who followed the market all day and traded off the market for gain and invested in shares and fixed income securities.  
92Mr Dreyfus had a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of NSW, an MBA from a UK management course called ""Cranfield"" and since 2004 had been a Master Stockbroker with the Strong Brokers Association in Australia.  Mr Dreyfus explained that the status of a Master Stockbroker is ascribed to people who have worked in the industry for a long time.  His clients included institutional clients, who were themselves professional fund managers, dealers who had orders to buy and sell shares to people like himself, active traders who were far more active in selling and buying and perhaps made riskier investments and conservative investors for whom capital preservation was very important and who relied heavily on Mr Dreyfus's advice.
93Mr Dreyfus indicated that he had never encountered information about companies that was not publicly available and discussed it with his clients.  He agreed that over the years he had cause to discuss the possibility of corporate activity with his clients.  He said:
""There's a variety of issues that need to be considered but there is not necessarily definitive answers in assessing whether a corporate action may or may not occur and as a financial advisor we try to make those assessments and then from that basis make recommendations to clients.""  (AB 3, T 811.41)
94Mr Dreyfus was asked to consider whether the information contained in MFI 4 would be likely to influence his clients.  He gave the following evidence in relation to MFI 4:
(a) Conservative low risk private clients: were unlikely to be interested in this type of information because of the assessment of the risk return trade off.  (AB 3, T816.43)
(b) Large institutional investors:  He agreed that the information in MFI 4 would be unlikely to influence such investors (AB 3, T818.10).
(c) Small and mid-cap investors:  Yes, the information would influence such investors because ""they specialise in small and mid-cap investments and QGC was a small or mid-cap company.  If they had investments anywhere in that sector, then this is information that is likely to influence them in making a decision about those investments.  (AB 3, T818.24)
(d) Active traders:  Yes, they had a higher tolerance for riskier investments, and those for whom shorter term capital gain could be more important than dividend income, those able to make quick decisions about whether or not to invest or those who had a good understanding about the energy sector would be likely to be influenced by MFI 4 (AB 3, T819.1).
(e) Hedge Fund clients:  Yes, if they believed the risk return parameters made a profitable outcome likely, they would be influenced in the decision about whether or not to acquire QGC shares.  Those investors were likely to conduct their own research before deciding whether or not to invest, in a shorter timeframe than large institutional funds (AB 3, T819.22).
95Mr Dreyfus said that there were a number of qualifications that might operate on the likelihood of the information in MFI 4 influencing investors to invest in QGC shares.  They included:  The age of the information, reliability and credibility of the source of the information, the question of how much BG was willing to spend, whether Santos or Origin would be targets if the QGC bid failed and whether BG could afford either of these, whether ARI was a reputable group, whether anyone had seen the ARI report, whether the Teams' assumptions about gas reserves matched that of other analysts, what other analysts thought of the Teams' valuation of Arrow and QGC, whether such valuations had implications for other companies, whether the valuations might tempt other companies to enter the market, what type of deal might be done between the companies, what the information might mean to AGL as a major QGC shareholder, whether AGL might block any deal, whether the market had already factored in the information and the likely impact on the QGC share price (AB 3, T822.31-823.46).
96In cross-examination Mr Dreyfus said that when forming his opinions he drew upon his experience of advising clients on listed securities across all sectors.  He agreed that he was not a specialist in advising on gas sector shares (AB 3, T825.31).
97Mr Dreyfus accepted that with respect to MFI 4, the position that the Team at BG had reached was that QGC was very much more favourable, in terms of worth and market price than Arrow.  He agreed that he had not done any analysis of the trading records or history of either Arrow or QGC before June or December 2007, to look for comparative events or releases of information to see what could be gauged from such a comparison.  He was referred to an ASX release, dated 5 December 2006, announcing that AGL had taken a significant stake in QGC and agreed that it was the sort of information that might cause a price increase in QGC.  He also agreed that this occurrence played no part in his opinion expressed about the QGC information that he had given, but denied that there was a resemblance between the 2006 occurrence and the happenings with BG and QGC in December 2007.
98Mr Dreyfus agreed that before a corporate announcement was made, there was always a level of uncertainty about whether it would succeed, and agreed that MFI 4 contained no announcement of any deal or bid and that added ""another layer of uncertainty"" (AB 3, T870.21).
99Mr Dreyfus was referred to MFI 4 and to particular (e) and agreed that if the information there set out had been obtained from publicly available material it would have made a big difference to his opinion.  He was not prepared to make the same concession with regard to particular (f) of MFI 4.  In relation to particular (f), he said:
""Q.  It wouldn't make any difference?A.  No, I'm not saying that.  I am, I'm saying it didn't have the basis to assess how they arrived at those figures.""  (AB 3, T897.47)
100Mr Dreyfus agreed that in order to assess the significance of the fact that the BG Team had prepared an evaluation of QGC and Arrow, something would need to be known about the Team.  Further, he agreed that it would be relevant to know whether or not BG was playing catch-up in the field of CSG to LNG in Eastern Australia.  He stated that what he took into account was the material presented to him in order to arrive at his conclusions (AB 3, T898.40).
101Mr Dreyfus referred to particular (d) of MFI 4 and said that he made no assumptions about whether the ARI resource figures referred to there, were being made known for the first time.  He would want to talk with analysts about whether such information had been priced in by the market and did not give consideration to that factor when forming his opinion.  He agreed that he did not do any independent research into the reliability of ARI's assessments (AB 3, T900.11).
102The applicant gave evidence.  He described his knowledge of LNG as quite extensive and deep and his knowledge of CSG as reasonable.  He was referred to the Agreed Facts and said that the share transactions there identified were a representative sample of his share portfolio between July 1997 and August 2007.  He said that he initially tended to rely upon the advice of his broker and his own reading of the Financial Review.  He focused mainly on buying things you could buy in floats and the banks and such like.  He borrowed money to buy shares and deducted interest from his income tax. 
103When he moved from Singapore, his practice changed after he lost a quarter of a million dollars on HIH, a company that his broker recommended.  That gave him a sour taste for advice from other people and it gave him a sour taste for investing in things he did not really understand.  As a result, he moved into resources because he knew about the resource business.  The mining and petroleum industries were industries in which he was comfortable.
104He said that he had been attracted to the Eastern Australian gas market because at that time Australian gas prices were extremely low by world standards.   He knew that as soon as Australia linked its gas prices to exports, they would rise.  He considered investing in five or six CSG companies being Origin, Santos, Arrow, QGC, Sunshine Gas and a little bit later, a company called ESG (Eastern Star Gas).  His interest in investing in CSG was to be an owner of a company that owned gas when gas prices rose on the East Coast to meet export standards.
105He said that in mid-June 2007, he attended an annual BG strategy presentation in the UK.  The purpose of these meetings was to put in front of the BG Group Executives as a whole, some of the opportunities that lay before the group or, some of the problems that lay before the group.  It was the only time that the Group Executives as a whole sat down with the Asset General Managers that ran BG's 30 assets and ""It was an opportunity to assess them and see how they handled pressure and so on.  It had an HR function as well"" (AB 3, T1011.14).  On the evening of 13 June 2007 he gave instructions to his broker at JB Ware to buy 100,000 Arrow shares and on 18 June 2007, he instructed the same broker to buy a further 150,000 shares.  Around 26 June 2007, the applicant recalled having a telephone conversation with Gary Thompson of BG.  He was interested in the potential for their work as it had been discussed a week or two earlier at the strategy session primarily, around small scale LNG and there was also talk about CSM.
106In July 2007 he had a meeting with Mr Maxwell and Mr Thompson in which the topic of discussion was him trying to answer a question from Mr Maxwell about how to get a business development project going and supported in BG.  Mr Maxwell was pretty frustrated and was picking the applicant's brains about it.  The applicant recalled receiving an email from Mr Maxwell, dated 1 August 2007.  The applicant said that the figures cited [for the reserves of gas held by Santos, Origin, QGC and Arrow] were not news to him and he knew roughly what the figures were (AB 3, T1021.28).
107The applicant recalled receiving an email from Tim Hargraves, dated 2 August 2007, in respect of Arrow's likely potential to be able to succeed in places like China and so forth.  He thought that what Tim was really saying was ""How is Arrow going to do it?""  He took this as a cautionary note that it was going to be hard for a company which had about 120 or 130 people in it to handle such a big issue.  Around 2 August 2007, he bought 100,000 shares in Sunshine Gas because Tim Hargraves had said that they were good value and he had a lot of regard for his judgment.
108In August 2007 he received an email from Mr Maxwell, attached to which was a copy of the TLP, being a business development plan for Eastern Australia.  The applicant had previously commented upon the document and saw his role as trying to see if there was anything he could suggest that would improve the quality of the paper, or the effectiveness of the paper.  
109The applicant recalled a meeting in late October 2007 between himself, Messrs Thompson and Seaton in his office at Thames Valley in the UK around lunchtime.  He recalled that the meeting was arranged by Mr Maxwell and identified an email from Mr Maxwell, dated 18 October 2007, in which Mr Maxwell suggested that Messrs Thompson and Seaton should spend some time sharing their work and insights regarding CSG with the applicant while they were in the UK.
110The applicant said that the meeting lasted about 45 minutes and they talked about LNG in Australia in general.  They then talked about CSG in Eastern Australia and about how a coal seam project in Australia should be structured, or could be structured, or could be put together and how, particularly, it could be shaped to sell it within each group.  Other than Woodside, he could not recall any other company names being mentioned.
111The applicant could not recall any documents or slides being before him at the meeting.  When referred to the Arrow Opportunity Pack and asked whether he recalled seeing any of the slides in 2008, he responded ""No, I did not.  I do recall I did not see them"" (AB3, T1032.23).  The applicant was then asked if he could recall seeing the slides at any time before 2008, to which he responded ""No"".  To the best of his recollection, he first saw the valuation slide in September 2009 in a meeting with ASIC.
112The applicant said that he did not recall seeing any of the slides indicated in AB 1, p213-223 [the QGC Opportunity Pack] before 2008 and that the first time that he saw AB 1, p215 [the QGC valuation slide] was in the same meeting with ASIC in September 2009.
113The applicant said that he recalled a meeting with Mr Maxwell in Singapore in November 2007.  He recalled that Mr Maxwell had arranged the meeting and that they had dinner at a restaurant at the Boat Quay.  The meeting lasted about an hour and a quarter.  They talked about the reorganisation going on at BG and also a number of topics including CSG in NSW and Arrow.  They also discussed the Chief Executive of Arrow.  The applicant said that a number of companies were discussed but QGC was not mentioned.  The applicant said that the only CSM they discussed was in relation to NSW.
114The applicant was directed to emails between himself and Mr Maxwell and said that it was unlikely that he had opened the attachments to an email from Mr Maxwell on 28 November 2007.  The applicant was directed to further emails between himself and Mr Maxwell to which he said that he would have opened the attachment to the email from Mr Maxwell dated 2 December 2007 when he returned to the UK on that date (the attachment is the ARI technical presentation on CSG presented to BG in London on 25 - 26 October 2007).
115The applicant agreed that on his return to the UK on the evening of 2 December 2007, he gave instructions to his stockbroker in Australia to sell Arrow and purchase QGC.  He said that he made that decision on that evening.  He said that before making his decision to sell Arrow and buy QGC, he had looked at some materials, including a report from Eastern Star Gas, the Arrow AGM 2007 publication and the Arrow 2006 AGM publication.  After reading these materials, he said, ""One of the items that really distinguished Arrow when I purchased them, was their access to very significant funding for exploration, a much bigger funding pot for exploration than any other Australian CSG company had fallen away"" (AB 3, T1043.30).
116The applicant also recalled that before his sale of Arrow and his purchase of QGC, he had a number of conversations with people who had influenced his decision to sell Arrow shares and purchase QGC on 2 December 2007.  These included the talk with Mr Maxwell in Singapore, a conversation with the Director General of Hydrocarbons while he was in India and a telephone conversation with his friend Tim Hargraves on 1 December 2007.
117The applicant was shown MFI 4 and directed to each particular in turn.  In relation to each particular, except (f) and (i), he claimed to have had some knowledge before 2 December 2007.
118When directed to an email, dated 8 December 2007, from Ashley Almanza of BG to him, amongst others, the applicant said that before receiving the email he had not been aware of ""Project Honey"".  He said that it was at that time, 8 December 2007, that he linked the project with QGC and became aware that this was the project that Mr Maxwell had been working on.  Before that, he had not been aware that the project that Mr Maxwell had been working on involved QGC (AB 3, T1056.2).
119The applicant recalled a meeting he had with Mr Vinter on 16 or 17 January 2008 in Mr Vinter's office.  He recalled the meeting because on 16 January ""Project Honey"" came before the Group Investment Committee for approval and he was at that meeting.  He went to Mr Vinter after the meeting to discuss his concerns about holding QGC shares and participating in the approval of the BG opportunity with QGC.  
120Under cross-examination the applicant said that he did not tell Mr Vinter when he had acquired the shares because he did not think that it was relevant.  He said that when he spoke to Mr Maxwell in Singapore (26 November 2007), Mr Maxwell did not talk about what his team was doing.  He was not particularly interested in knowing what Mr Maxwell and his team were doing as he had enough on his plate.
121The applicant said that in the emails from Mr Maxwell, after their meeting in Singapore, Mr Maxwell had referred to the project he was working on in a roundabout way.  When the applicant was referred to an email from Mr Maxwell to him on 2 December 2007, the applicant said that the email did not give him a clue as to the identity of the Queensland opportunity, nor did he think it appropriate to ask.  He also did not want to know.
122When the applicant was referred to an email he sent to Mr Maxwell on 2 December 2007 he said that he knew that Mr Maxwell ""was pursuing some sort of partnership or something in Australia"".  The applicant said that most of the thinking he did about his decision to sell Arrow and buy QGC was done on the overnight flight back to England from India.  It had nothing to do with what was happening at BG.  The applicant said that he did not think it was inappropriate to buy QGC shares because he did not have knowledge of what Mr Maxwell was doing.  If he had known, he would not have done so.
123The applicant denied that Mr Maxwell mentioned QGC or Queensland Gas during their Singapore meeting.  The applicant agreed that at the time of the purchase of the QGC shares in December 2007, he held around 3 million shares in Innamincka, a small shareholding in Tattersalls, and several million dollars in a stockbroker's account.  
124The applicant denied that two valuation slides, with respect to Arrow and QGC, were on the table when the meeting took place between himself, Mr Thompson and Mr Seaton on 23 October 2007.  He also denied that he and Mr Seaton went through the slides.  He denied that Mr Thompson had said that QGC looked like a better opportunity than Arrow for BG.  The applicant said that he did not recall Arrow or QGC being mentioned at the meeting.
125The applicant agreed that the QGC opportunity had moved very quickly from the time that he had seen Messrs Thompson and Seaton to the time when BG decided to act on the relationship with QGC.  He denied that he was aware that Mr Maxwell's team thought QGC a better opportunity than Arrow at the time he met Messrs Thompson and Seaton.  He said that he was not aware that QGC was a target for BG, until after he bought his QGC shares.
126The applicant said that on 15 January 2008 he received an email from Kim Howell of BG with a very detailed briefing pack about QGC for the Investment Committee Meeting, which was to take place the next day.  After the applicant attended the meeting, he went to see Mr Vinter.  He said that he did not know at the time of the meeting with Mr Maxwell in Singapore on 27 November 2007 that the Maxwell team did not regard Arrow as an opportunity.
127The applicant said that when he sold his Arrow shares to buy QGC shares, he believed that he was lucky to get his money back.  He said that he sold Arrow shares rather than bought QGC shares.  He further added that he would not have bought the QGC shares if he had not decided to sell Arrow - he substituted the QGC investment for the Arrow investment.  When it was suggested to the applicant that the reason he sold Arrow and bought QGC was because he wanted to take advantage of what he knew about BG's intended corporate action with respect to QGC, he said ""I could not do that Mr Crown, I didn't have that information.  I wouldn't do that Mr Crown"" (AB 3, T1115.26).
128When the applicant was shown MFI 4, he agreed that he had knowledge of the information contained in particulars (a) and (b) [when he purchased the QGC shares].  The applicant agreed that he was aware of particular (c) but drew a distinction between what he knew and what he believed the position was and the details in particular (c).  He agreed that he was aware of particular (d), but had no recollection of opening the report [ARI Technical Presentation] when it was sent to him by Mr Maxwell on 2 December 2007.  He simply could not remember.  The applicant agreed that he was aware of particular (e).  He denied that he had seen particular (f) and denied discussing valuations at the meeting with Messrs Thompson and Seaton on 23 October 2007.  He said that his memory was crystal clear on this issue.
129The applicant agreed that he possessed the information in particulars (g) and (h).  He reiterated that during the meeting with Mr Maxwell in Singapore (27 November 2007) there was no discussion about what Mr Maxwell was going to be doing in Australia.  
130The applicant was directed to an email from him to Mr Vinter, dated 21 November 2008, in particular, the words ""we [the applicant and Mr Maxwell at the Singapore meeting] talked about Arrow"".  The applicant was asked whether Mr Maxwell mentioned QGC to which the applicant responded ""I am pretty sure he didn't, well, yes, I am clear that he did not mention QGC"" (AB 3, T1126.13).
Submissions
131The parties accepted that the directions as to the elements of the offence of insider trading given by the trial judge were correct.  By reference to counts 3 and 4 those directions were:
""ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENCE OF INSIDER TRADING
There are four elements of the offence.  They are (for counts 3 and 4):
1. that, between 2 December and 8 December 2007, the accused acquired 250,000 shares in Queensland Gas Company Ltd;
2. that he did so intentionally;
3. that, at the time he acquired the shares, the accused possessed inside information;
inside information means information in relation to which the following paragraphs are satisfied:
(a) the information is not generally available;
(b) if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of particular Division 3 financial products 
4. that, at the time he acquired the shares, the accused knew or ought reasonably to have known:
(i) that the information was not generally available; and
(ii) that, if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares.""
132Elements 1 and 2 of the offence played no part in the appeal and need not be further considered.  In relation to element 3, the written direction provided by her Honour was:
""ELEMENT 3 - POSSESSION OF INSIDE INFORMATION
3. Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he acquired the shares, the accused possessed inside information?
The ""inside information"" relied upon by the Crown for counts 3 and 4 is the information set out in MFI 4.  
You must be satisfied that the accused possessed that body of information, that is, all of the information set out in MFI 4, taken in combination.
However, you do not have to be satisfied that the information was conveyed to the accused in the precise terms in which it is set out in MFI 4.  The test is whether the accused possessed the substance of that information, taken as a whole or in combination, except any part of the information that you consider makes no real difference.
Information:  is not confined to the statements of fact.  It includes matters of supposition or assumption, and other matters that would not be sufficiently definite to warrant being made known to the public.  It also includes matters relating to the intentions or likely intentions of a person.
Inside information: means information that:
(a) is not generally available; and
(b) is such that, if it were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares.
In order to be ""inside information"", the information relied upon by the Crown must satisfy both limbs of that definition.
Each limb of that definition includes a term that is further defined in the Act.  You must determine this issue having regard to those further definitions.
""Generally available""
The first limb is that the information is not generally available.
Information is ""generally available"" if it is readily observable.  That includes any deductions, conclusions or inferences from such information.
Information is also generally available if it has been made known in a way that is likely to bring it to the attention of investors (persons who commonly invest in Division 3 financial products of a kind whose price might be affected by the information) AND a reasonable time has passed for the information to be disseminated among such investors.  Again, that includes any deductions, conclusions or inferences from such information.
""Division 3 financial products"" means financial products that can be traded on a financial market including securities (including shares), derivatives, interests in a managed investment scheme, debentures, stocks or bonds and superannuation products.
This test tells you when information is ""generally available"".  In order to establish that the information in MFI 4 was ""inside information"", the first limb the Crown has to prove is that the information was not generally available.  In order to be satisfied that the information was not generally available, you must be satisfied that it does not satisfy this test.
You have to determine whether the information particularised in MFI 4, considered as a combination, was not generally available.
It is not necessary for the Crown to prove that each part of the combination considered separately, by itself, in isolation from the rest of the information in the combination, was information which was not generally available.
""Material effect"":
The second limb of ""inside information"" is that, if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares.
A reasonable person would expect the information in MFI 4 to have a material effect on the price or value of shares in QGC if (and only if) that information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly acquire Division 3 financial products in deciding whether or not to acquire or dispose of shares in QGC.
You are asked to measure the materiality of the information from the standpoint of a reasonable person and on the basis that you are assessing its likely influence not on just any person in society but on persons with some experience of the stock market.
You have to determine the information particularised in MFI 4, considered as a combination.
It is not necessary for the Crown to prove that each part of the combination, considered separately and in isolation from the rest of the information in the combination, was information which would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly acquire Division 3 financial products in deciding whether or not to acquire or dispose of shares in QGC.
""Possessed inside Information"":
The Crown must establish that the accused had the information in his mind, that is, that he knew that information.
133Given the complexity of Element 3, her Honour provided to the jury a summary.  The parties accepted the correctness of that summary.
""SUMMARY AS TO ELEMENT 3
3. Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he acquired the shares, the accused possessed inside information?
(a) Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the information?
(b) Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that the information was not generally available?
(c) Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that, if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares.  This test is satisfied if (and only if) the information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly acquire Division 3 financial products in deciding whether or not to acquire or dispose of shares in QGC.""
134As with Element 3, the parties accepted as correct the trial judge's written direction to the jury in relation to Element 4 of the offence of insider trading.
""ELEMENT 4 - KNOWLEDGE THAT THE INFORMATION WAS INSIDE INFORMATION
4. Has the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew or ought reasonably to have known that:
(i) the information was not ""generally available""; and
(ii) if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a ""material effect"" on the price or value of particular Division 3 financial products (here, shares in QGC)?
In determining whether the accused ought reasonably to have known that the information had those two qualities, you must consider all of the relevant circumstances of the accused, including his mental state at the time.""
Applicant's submissions
135The applicant submitted that the information in particulars (a) - (c) of MFI 4 did not constitute ""inside information"".  He submitted that a general investigation of the kind which BG carried out in relation to CSG on the eastern coast of Australia did no more than elicit matters of general knowledge within the relevant market.  He noted that in relation to (d), the Crown had accepted that the information which ARI assembled was all sourced from material which was publicly available.  He submitted that it was no part of the Crown case that what ARI reported to BG derived from material other than that which was publicly available.
136The applicant made the same submission in relation to particular of information (e) in MFI 4.  He accepted that particular (e) involved quantitative information, as opposed to qualitative information, but as with particular (d) he submitted that it was based on information which was readily available to persons in the industry who chose to inquire about it.  
137The applicant accepted that the information, in particular (g), was obviously private in that it related to a conclusion of Mr Maxwell.  Nevertheless, he submitted that this conclusion was on its face quite unremarkable in that Arrow appeared to be the poorest in relation to that consideration.  The applicant submitted that this was a conclusion which was obvious from information which was publicly available and was a conclusion which had been arrived at by others who had considered that publicly available information.  
138In relation to particular (h), the applicant accepted that Mr Maxwell had been working on something called a ""Queensland opportunity"" and that after they spoke in Singapore in November 2007, Mr Maxwell was going to Queensland to further investigate that matter.  The applicant submitted, however, that there were at this stage four companies still under consideration, i.e., Santos, Origin, QGC and Arrow.  He submitted that the investigation of the ""opportunity"" was still in the first phase of investigation, i.e., the ""create phase"".  There was no agreement, but rather there was a range of things which had yet to be agreed.  There was at most the possibility or hope of some deal or agreement in the offing.  The applicant submitted that this could not be regarded as inside information, in the relevant sense, and that the Crown had not made submissions to that effect at trial or on appeal. 
139The applicant submitted that this analysis of the MFI 4 particulars placed into context the importance of particular (f).   Particular (f) was private in the sense that a calculation had been made and a conclusion had been reached based on publicly available information.  To achieve the information contained in particular (f) involved a process which included the application of judgment.  The applicant accepted that the information in particular (f) could satisfy elements 3 and 4 of the offence of insider trading.  The applicant submitted that it was particular (f) which tied the other particulars together to bring about the conclusion in particular (i).
140The applicant noted that no submission had been made at trial by either side to the effect that particular (f) was one which would make no real difference if it were omitted from the particulars of information in MFI 4.
141The applicant acknowledged that the test for element 3 of the offence included ""whether the accused possessed the substance of that information, taken as a whole in combination, except any part of the information that you consider makes no real difference"".  In the appeal, that qualification was described as the ""proviso"".  While acknowledging the correctness of that test and of that statement of the proviso, the applicant submitted that the importance of the information in particular (f), both on its own and in its relation to the other particulars of information in MFI 4, made it unreasonable for a jury to treat it as something the omission of which would make no real difference.  He submitted that the information in particular (f) went to the very heart of value buying.
142It was the Crown case that the information in particular (f) was conveyed by Messrs Seaton and Thompson to the applicant at the meeting on 23 October 2007.  It was not suggested that words to the effect of particular (f) were spoken to the applicant.  The inference sought to be drawn was that the information was conveyed to him by what was said and an examination and comparison of two groups of documents - the Arrow opportunity pack and the QGC opportunity pack.  The documents particularly relied on were slide 9 of the Arrow pack and slide 2 of the QGC pack which were known as the ""valuation slides"".
143The applicant submitted that there was no evidence which would enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the information in particular (f) was conveyed to him on this occasion.  He submitted that the evidence of Messrs Seaton and Thompson did not reach that standard.  The applicant submitted that an analysis of their evidence validated that submission.
144In his evidence in chief, Mr Thompson said about the slides - ""just had them on the table for discussion points"" and ""when the two valuation slides were on the table, which Jim [Seaton] mainly spoke to, that QGC looked like a better opportunity than Arrow"".   Mr Thompson said that it was Mr Seaton who went through the slides and that he ""believed"" that Mr Seaton ""said things about them"".
145In cross-examination Mr Thompson said that he could not remember specifically speaking to any slide.  Mr Thompson did, however, recollect that the two valuation slides were on the table and were shown by Mr Seaton to the applicant.  Mr Thompson agreed that when examined under oath, he said that he could not recall which specific slide or slides Mr Seaton had shown.  Mr Thompson agreed that the ASIC examination was much closer in time to the events in question and that he did not claim to have a better recollection at trial than he did when questioned by ASIC.
146The applicant relied upon the following evidence:
""Q.  It is fair to say isn't it, that you can't possibly now say what it is, if anything, that Mr Seaton went through, that he said, about any of the contents of that slide, do you agree?A.  I just have a general recollection of both Arrow and QGC being discussed by Mr Seaton but I can't recall specific details. 
Q.  You don't mean by that, do you, that they were the only companies whose plays were mentioned do you?A.  We talked more broadly than just Arrow and QGC.""  (AB 2, T426.20)
147The applicant submitted that the evidence of Mr Thompson depended upon Mr Seaton filling in the gaps, i.e. giving evidence as to what in fact he said concerning the two slides and to what extent he directed the applicant's attention to them.  There was nothing in Mr Thompson's evidence to the effect that he observed the applicant examining or comparing the slides.  In that regard, the applicant submitted that the information in particular (f) was not set out in terms on the slides, but required some analysis of the slides themselves.  The applicant submitted that the evidence of Mr Thompson at trial, which represented the high point of the Crown case in relation to particular of information (f), was significantly undermined by its inconsistency with the evidence given to ASIC some three and a half years previously.
148The applicant submitted that the evidence of Mr Seaton failed to fill in any of the gaps in Mr Thompson's evidence.  While Mr Seaton had a copy of the QGC pack, he could not recall having the Arrow pack at that time.  Mr Seaton could not remember saying anything in relation to the Arrow pack at the meeting, he could not recall whether anything was shown to the applicant at the meeting, be that slides or graphs, nor could he recall any specific discussion about any particular companies, in particular QGC, at the meeting.
149The applicant submitted that because the information in particular (f) was not in terms set out in the slides but required some analysis and explanation, there needed to be evidence that some such analysis or explanation took place at the meeting.  The applicant submitted that there was no such evidence.  The applicant submitted that there was no evidence of any net asset value (NAV) discussion, or any discussion of share price.  The applicant submitted that this evidence could not have satisfied the jury beyond reasonable doubt that he possessed the information in item (f) at the relevant time.
150The applicant relied upon a separate and independent basis upon which the verdicts against him should be set aside and the convictions quashed - namely, that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the information contained in MFI 4 was material in the sense that if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares.  
151In accordance with the directions of the trial judge, the applicant submitted that in order to satisfy this element of the offence, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:
(a) If the information in MFI 4 possessed by the applicant (being all of the information in MFI 4 taken in combination) were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares; and
(b) A reasonable person would expect the information in MFI 4 to have a material effect on the price or value of shares in QGC if (and only if) that information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly acquire Division 3 financial products in deciding whether or not to acquire or dispose of shares in QGC.
152The applicant submitted that the jury could not have been satisfied that the information possessed by him was material on the evidence adduced by the Crown.
153The Crown sought to prove materiality primarily through an ""expert"", Mr Dreyfus.  The Crown also relied on the fact that, in early February 2008, when a deal between QGC and BG was finalised and announced, the QGC share price increased.  The applicant submitted that neither of these matters provided a safe basis for the jury to be satisfied to the relevant standard on the issue of materiality.
154The applicant submitted that Mr Dreyfus had no expertise in the LNG and CSG sector.  The applicant was critical of the way in which the evidence was given by Mr Dreyfus.  The evidence was given ""through the prism of what he would be telling his clients"".   By reference to the information in MFI 4, he was asked ""would this be something that you'd consider and use in giving advice?""  The questions were not put in terms of ""if you were advising your client and after the event were given the information in MFI 4, being something you didn't know before, would it make any difference?""  This process was followed in relation to each class of client.  The applicant submitted that the relevance of such a process of questioning was problematic when the issue was whether the relevant information would have an effect on the price and value of a security.
155The applicant submitted that the statements of opinion by Mr Dreyfus as to whether or not the information in MFI 4 would be likely to influence certain classes of investors, were on his own admission, so heavily qualified by reference to matters that he was not able to consider or did not consider, as to render them of no utility.
156The applicant submitted that the matters of qualification, which Mr Dreyfus was not able to consider, went to matters that were fundamental in the sense that they made the difference between whether the information could possibly influence a person in deciding to acquire or dispose of shares, or not (those qualifications were set out at AB 3, T820.11-823.46).  With specific reference to QGC, these qualifications raised the following issues - the age of the information, its reliability and credibility, its source, how much BG was willing to spend, whether Santos or Origin could be targets if an attempt to strike a deal with QGC failed and whether BG could afford to deal with either Santos or Origin.  
157The applicant noted that the qualifications included such rudimentary matters as what was already priced into the QGC share price by the market at the time of the putative announcement of the information contained in MFI 4.  Mr Dreyfus did not undertake any analysis of what in fact was already priced in.  The applicant submitted that this was a significant issue, and it was not in dispute at trial that much of the information contained in MFI 4 was, as at early December 2007, already in the public domain.
158In relation to the increase in QGC's share price, the applicant submitted that the rise in February 2008 provided no safe basis for the jury to find that the information in MFI 4 was material.  There were a number of reasons for this.  There were other factors which could account for such an increase, in particular the announcement of substantial gas reserves.  The applicant submitted that the information in fact announced by BG and QGC in February 2008 was not properly comparable with the information in MFI 4.  He submitted that to do so involved an apples and oranges comparison.  The applicant submitted that not only was the information different but that Mr Dreyfus, because he had not made the preparatory inquiries, could not express an opinion concerning the likely impact of the MFI 4 information on the QGC share price.
159The applicant submitted that taken at its highest, the effect of the information in MFI 4 was that as at early December 2007 there was a ""possibility"" of a ""deal"" between BG and QGC and that discussions were to be had to see if a deal could be done.  By contrast, what was announced in 2008 was an actual finalised deal between BG and QGC of a particular scope and magnitude.  The applicant submitted that relevant to the question of materiality of the information contained in MFI 4, as at December 2007, was an understanding of the possibility of a deal being done, the scope of that deal and what the market had already priced into QGC's share price as at that date on account of the possibility of a deal being done.  The applicant submitted that none of these matters were dealt with by the Crown.  The applicant submitted that the Crown did not provide the jury with any basis whereby it could reason back from the price increase as a result of the announcement in February 2008 to the question of materiality in December 2007.  Without such a basis, any link between the increase in the share price of QGC in February 2008 and the information in MFI 4, would involve speculation.
160The applicant noted that the announcement in February 2008 did not relate only to the ""deal"" between BG and QGC but also that QGC had significantly more gas in reserves and in contingent resources than the market had previously understood.  In accordance with the evidence of Cottee, the applicant submitted that this was a significant and positive matter in terms of the future prospects of QGC and thus would likely have had a positive impact on QGC's share price.  The applicant submitted that the jury was not given any means by which it could disentangle for itself the obvious effect this positive component would have had on the market in February 2008 from the news of the deal which had been entered into.  The applicant submitted that absent any such means, it would have been dangerous for the jury to speculate for itself as to the existence and extent of any connection.
161In summary, the applicant submitted that the Crown did not attempt through Mr Dreyfus or otherwise, to show the jury how, if at all, it could adjust for the obvious differences between the position of BG in early December 2007 and that which was announced in February 2008, e.g., the possibility of a deal with QGC, the details of which were unknown, and an actual deal with clear terms and conditions and an announcement of substantial reserves.  The applicant submitted that without providing a methodology for such an adjustment, there was no safe or reasonable way for the jury to treat the price move in February 2008 when working out the materiality of the information in MFI 4 as to price sensitivity.  The applicant submitted that the evidence before the jury was insufficient to enable the jury to properly use the QGC share price rise on the issue of materiality.
162In relation to materiality generally, the applicant relied upon an annotated copy of MFI 4 which contained references to and extracts from Exhibit 4 to illustrate that the important parts of the information in MFI 4 were already relevantly available in the public domain.  Those extracts from Exhibit 4 were collected in a separate volume, which was provided to the court by the applicant.  In doing so, the applicant noted that he was not undertaking the onus of establishing that fact.  Rather, he submitted, the extracted parts of Exhibit 4 made clear the extent to which the Crown had failed to establish materiality with respect to the information in MFI 4 and the consequent unreasonableness of the jury's verdict.
Crown's submissions
163The Crown submitted that each of the particulars of information in MFI 4 constituted a part of a ""pathway"" towards the issue of materiality, i.e. price sensitivity.  By reference to that analogy, the Crown posed the question whether if a paving stone were missing in that pathway, could the jury still get to price sensitivity?
164While not conceding that there was insufficient evidence to establish particular of information (f) in MFI 4, the Crown submitted that its absence was not fatal to the Crown case.  This was because the significance of any discrete component of the body of information in MFI 4 was a question of fact for the jury.  This was in accord with the direction by the trial judge in relation to element 3 which both sides had accepted as correct.  The Crown submitted that even without particular (f), the information in MFI 4 was sufficient to establish the offence.
165The Crown relied on her Honour's written direction as to element 3 of the offence (par [132] hereof) and on the following oral direction in the summing up:
""92 You do not have to be satisfied that the information was conveyed to the accused in the precise terms in which it is set out in MFI 4.  The test is whether the accused possessed the substance of that information taken as a whole or in combination, except any part of the information that you consider makes no real difference.""  (AB 3, T1318)
166The Crown submitted that the effect of that part of the summing up and of the written direction was that the significance of any discrete part of the information in MFI 4 was a question of fact for the jury.  The Crown submitted that these directions left the jury in a position of deciding for themselves whether any part of the information made no real difference.
167The Crown submitted that it was left open to the jury to find in respect of particular (f), as with any other particular, that a failure to prove it in part or in whole made no real difference, especially in the context of proof of the other particulars.  In that regard, the Crown noted that the applicant did not argue a lack of proof of possession of the information in the other particulars.  It also noted that the jury were not directed that proof of any individual particular was essential to their verdict or that any one particular was more important than any other.
168The Crown put the same submission in a slightly different way.  The Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to find that any individual particular was of no real importance and to act on the rest.  By way of example, the Crown submitted that it could be argued that the content of particulars (h) and (i) relating to the imminent BG activity aimed at ""capturing the Queensland opportunity"", taken in the context of particulars (a) - (e) and (g), was sufficient in itself to establish the necessary qualities which the information as a whole was required to have, in order for the subject counts to be sustained.  The Crown submitted that in such circumstances it followed that the information in particular (f) could satisfy the description of making ""no real difference"".
169In oral submissions, the Crown submitted that even without the information in particular (f), the other information in MFI 4 was to the effect that the monolithic BG was to enter into a co-operative arrangement, or relationship, with the diminutive QGC and that that of itself would be sufficient to permit a conclusion as to materiality and inside information (Appeal T34.4 - .36).  In support of that submission, the Crown relied upon the meeting between the applicant and Mr Maxwell in Singapore on 27 November 2007 and the exchange of emails which took place between the applicant and Mr Maxwell between 28 November and 2 December 2007 when the applicant first acquired QGC shares.  The Crown submitted that the inevitable inference to be drawn from the meeting, those emails and the purchase of QGC shares was that the applicant had such information which of its nature was price sensitive.
170The Crown submitted that for the applicant to succeed, the Court would have to be satisfied as to two things:
(a) That it had been established by the applicant that it was not open to the jury to find that he possessed the information in particular (f); and
(b) If so, that part of the information not found to be possessed by the applicant did not satisfy the requirement of making ""no real difference"" to the whole of the information as particularised in MFI 4.
171The Crown did not accept the proposition that it was not open to the jury to find that the applicant was in possession of the information in particular (f) of MFI 4.  The Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to accept the evidence in chief of Mr Thompson, which of itself was sufficient to allow an inference to be drawn that the information in particular (f) was conveyed to the applicant.  The Crown relied upon Mr Thompson's evidence identifying ""two valuation slides which were on the table"", that Mr Seaton ""went through the slides"" and that ""QGC looked like a better opportunity than Arrow"".  The Crown relied on Mr Thompson's evidence that the applicant had suggested modifications to another slide (but not one of the two valuation slides).  The Crown relied upon the circumstances leading up to the meeting between the applicant and Messrs Thompson and Seaton, i.e. the email from Mr Maxwell of 18 October 2007 advising the applicant that the two men were coming to head office:
""... for internal reviews on the CSG work which is going very well.  Some very interesting insights are emerging from the technical work and we have identified a valuable opportunity which we are now moving quickly on.  I have suggested to Gary and Jim that they spend some time with you sharing the work and insights/results.""  (AB 1, p 224)
172The Crown relied upon the applicant's admitted interest in Australian oil and gas shares and his substantial shareholding in Arrow.  The Crown noted the applicant's prior assistance to Mr Maxwell with the work of the Team and his support for pursuing business developments in Australia.
173The Crown submitted that those matters were available to be taken into account by the jury, so as to enable them to conclude that the information in particular (f) had come into the possession of the applicant at the meeting.  The Crown submitted that Mr Seaton's failure to recall relevant detail did not undermine the evidence of Mr Thompson.  It simply added nothing to it.  The Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to discard the applicant's version of the meeting, leaving it open to accept Mr Thompson's account in chief, when coupled with the surrounding circumstances.
174In relation to Ground 3, i.e. that the evidence in the Crown case could not have satisfied the jury that the information possessed by the applicant was material in the sense of s1042D of the Act, the Crown relied upon the evidence of Mr Dreyfus but not only on that evidence.  The Crown adopted as part of its submission the following statement of principle by the trial judge from her judgment as to the admissibility of the evidence of Mr Dreyfus.
""11 The intention of the Legislature appears to have been that materiality must be measured against both reasonableness and some knowledge of the market.  The expectations of a reasonable person are quintessentially within the province of the jury.  That is an issue that need not, and should not, be informed by any subjective opinion or assessment whether or not based on specialised knowledge.  However, in expressly confining materiality to the likely influence of the information on ""persons who commonly acquire Division 3 financial products"", the statute requires the jury to apply that test by reference to a reasonable person armed with some knowledge of the matters likely to influence the trading decisions of persons who commonly trade in the market.  That is an issue which draws in part on matters of common sense well within the province of the jury, but one as to which specialised knowledge might also be brought to bear.""  (AB 3, p 1413)
175The Crown submitted that the evidence of Mr Dreyfus went directly to the issue of the materiality of the information in MFI 4 in that the information was likely to influence certain categories of investors in the relevant way.  In relation to some of the qualifications which he expressed when giving that evidence, the Crown submitted that these were answered by other evidence in the case.  The Crown referred particularly to the age of the information, the reliability and credibility of the information, the reputability of ARI and whether anyone had seen the ARI report which were all answered in that way.
176The Crown submitted that the evidence of Mr Dreyfus assisted its case in two ways.  The first and principal way was his expression of opinion about the significance of the particulars of information in MFI 4.  In addition, his evidence had the effect of vesting the jury members with additional knowledge which could be combined with their own common sense in the way referred to by her Honour.  This was the secondary effect of his evidence, i.e., to identify the factors which in his view were worthy of consideration when the jury came to consider what should be considered, or might be considered, in relation to the materiality question.
177The Crown submitted that even if the evidence of Mr Dreyfus was significantly discounted so as to reduce its utility, this would not lead to the conclusion that it was not open to the jury to find that the MFI 4 information was material since its members were still able to act on their own common sense.  The Crown submitted that the information about the imminent potential involvement of BG with QGC, as contained in MFI 4 and as specifically set out in particulars (h) and (i), left it open to the jury to conclude that materiality had been established.
178On that issue, the Crown relied specifically upon the following directions by the trial judge (which were not challenged by the applicant):
""51 Conversely, if you don't accept Mr Dreyfus's evidence, just because you do not accept it does not mean of itself that the Crown has failed to prove materiality.  There is no rule that says that the Crown has to have an expert witness to prove that issue.  Ultimately, whether you accept Mr Dreyfus's evidence is entirely a matter for you.
...
123 So this question of whether a reasonable person would expect the information to have a material effect is a question of fact but it is one which calls on your collective common sense and your experience of the world and it is also one in respect of which you might be assisted by expert evidence.  You were asked to measure the materiality of the information from the standpoint of a reasonable person ...
124 The question whether information is likely to influence investors and the expectations of a reasonable person on that issue are quintessentially within your province, ladies and gentlemen.  That is the very kind of issue for which juries are brought together and considered the appropriate decision makers about questions of fact.""  (AB 3, p 1305 ff)
179The Crown submitted that its case was consistent with these directions but did in addition call in aid the evidence of Mr Dreyfus.  The Crown emphasised the significance of the impact of the proposed alliance between BG and QGC based in part on evidence such as that of Mr Cottee, that the deal with BG ""opened the world as a place where we can sell gas"".  On this issue, the Crown also relied upon the disproportion in size between BG and QGC as relevant to the question of materiality.
180The Crown relied on the increase in the share price of QGC in February 2008 as relevant to the materiality of the information in MFI 4.  In that regard, the Crown noted that her Honour had cautioned the jury in an extensive direction about reasoning back from the information in the announcement to the effect of the available information as it stood at the time of the applicant's acquisition of QGC shares.  The Crown submitted that even though there might be an absence of consideration of or knowledge of the effect of other information on the increase in the QGC share price, the question was still for a person in the position of a juror to consider whether or not a person who commonly acquired shares would, in the circumstances of the information contained in MFI 4, be influenced in deciding whether or not to acquire QGC shares.
Consideration
181For the applicant to succeed in this appeal, he has to bring himself within s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which states that the Court of Criminal Appeal ""shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".  The evidence and the competing submissions based on them have already been reviewed.  It is, however, necessary to take account of what the authorities say as to how this Court should determine whether or not the applicant has satisfied that requirement.
182Guidance on this issue was most recently provided by the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.  There the majority said:
""The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".
12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""
13 The starting point in the application of s6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.  However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.
14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"".  In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict.  Questions of law are separately dealt with by s6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""""
183By way of further guidance, the majority said in SKA:
""20 The reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal exposes a fundamental problem with its approach to its task.  The Court concerned itself with whether, as a question of law, there was evidence to support the verdicts, rather than making its own independent assessment of the evidence. ...  
21 To determine satisfactorily the applicant's appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to determine whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged.""  
184An explanation of what is meant by the phrase ""open to the jury"" was provided by Hayne J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed) in Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113]:
""113 It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count.  But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.  It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. ...""
Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2
185Fundamental to the success of Grounds 1 and 2 is the proposition that it was not open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the information in particular (f) of MFI 4 was possessed by the applicant on 2 December 2007 because such a finding could not be made on the evidence.  The applicant's case was that the jury having properly examined the evidence on this issue must have had a reasonable doubt.  In my opinion, the applicant has established this proposition.  Having reviewed the whole of the evidence, I am left with a reasonable doubt on this issue and that is a doubt which the jury should have had.  It is not a doubt which can be resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence.
186Even if it be accepted that the information in particular (f) of MFI 4 could have been deduced on a relatively brief evaluation of the valuation slides in question, evidence concerning the slides leaves reasonable doubt as to whether the applicant was in a position to conduct such an examination much less that he had done so.  I have set out the evidence of Mr Thompson in pars [144] - [146] above.  That evidence even taken at its highest, does not go so far as to suggest that the applicant examined the slides.  Further, to the extent that the evidence went further than the sworn evidence of Mr Thompson at his ASIC examination that he could not recall which slides had been shown to the applicant, the evidence at the trial must be considered in the context of the concession by Mr Thompson that he did not have a better recollection at the trial than when questioned by ASIC.
187The evidence of Mr Seaton does not dispel the reasonable doubt.  He could not recall (see par [148]) what was shown to the applicant.
188The information in particular (f) of MFI 4 said to be possessed by the applicant, was information of a precise kind.  It did not emerge obviously from either the Arrow valuation slide or the QGC valuation slide.  It required some analysis of the slides to adduce that information.  The information was specifically related to share price.  There was nothing in the evidence in chief of Mr Thompson which even remotely referred to that topic.   When he said that Mr Seaton ""spoke to"" the slides, there was no further evidence as to what was said other than ""QGC looked like a better opportunity than Arrow"".  There was no elaboration as to the basis for that observation.  Such an observation could refer to a number of considerations besides share price and the undervalue of the QGC share price.
189That deficiency in the evidence was not overcome by the contextual evidence of the email from Mr Maxwell which set out the purpose of the meeting.
190By reference to the evidence of Mr Thompson in chief and the contextual evidence, a jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any discussion of the share price of Arrow and QGC took place, let alone a discussion which included a conclusion that the share price of QGC was significantly undervalued.  When one adds to that equation the absence of any confirmatory evidence from Mr Seaton, and the unexplained discrepancy between the evidence at trial and the statement made under oath by Mr Thompson to ASIC over three and a half years before, the difficulty in the jury drawing the necessary inference beyond reasonable doubt was compounded.
191This does not end the matter.  It is necessary to consider the point taken by the Crown on appeal that in accordance with her Honour's direction in relation to element 3 of the offence, a failure to prove that the applicant possessed the information in particular (f) did not affect proof of the offence, provided the jury considered that the particular (f) information ""made no real difference"".  That argument depends upon the Crown establishing two matters:  first, that it was open to the jury to decide for themselves whether the particular (f) information made no real difference and that the remaining information in MFI 4, absent particular (f), was sufficient in a price sensitive way to establish the offence.
192In considering the first matter, it was the position of the Crown on appeal that the effect of her Honour's summing up and written direction as to element 3 of the offence was that the significance of any discrete part of the information in MFI 4 was a question of fact for the jury.  In my opinion, that proposition is too broadly stated.
193The direction by the trial judge which was not disputed by the parties was:
""The test is whether the accused possessed the substance of that information taken as a whole or in combination except any part of the information that you consider makes no real difference.""
194The submission by the Crown fails to consider the subject matter of the ""proviso"", i.e. makes no real difference to what.  This can only be a reference to ""that information"" which is the charged information.  It cannot refer to a difference to ""materiality"".  Something is either material or it is not.  The question was whether it made a difference to the substance of the information as charged, to omit particular (f).  
195Particular (f) added a significant consideration which was not elsewhere dealt with in MFI 4 and it was directly related to the asserted unlawful purpose of the decision to acquire the shares in QGC.  It would not only be unrealistic for the jury to have ignored or left out of consideration particular (f), it would have been unreasonable.  In other words, it would have been quite unreasonable for the jury to have concluded that the information in particular (f) made no real difference to the substance of the information in MFI 4.  As was submitted by the applicant, it was the information in particular (f) which tied the other particulars together to bring about the conclusion in particular (i).
196In oral submissions, the applicant put the proposition in this way:
""That's why one can say that the proviso ... is something which tells the jury to contemplate whether the omission of an item would make any real difference to the substance of ... the charged information.  The charged information is and is only that which is found in the particulars, that's why the metaphor pathway really doesn't help.  It's not something that you can step on or off as you please so long as you get to the destination, it is the definition of the destination.""  (AT 66.28)
197That still leaves for consideration the second matter, i.e. the Crown's submission that even without particular (f) the remaining information in MFI 4 was sufficient in itself to establish the necessary qualities which the information as a whole was required to have in order for the subject counts to be sustained.  In that regard, it is important to note that no submission was made at trial by either side to the effect that the information in particular (f) was such as would make no real difference if it were omitted from the particulars of information in MFI 4.  While it was argued by the applicant at trial that possession of the information in particular (f) had not been established against him, the Crown case at trial was always that the applicant was in possession of the substance of the whole of the information in MFI 4.
198The problem for the Crown is that this proposition which was put for the first time on appeal was never in terms put to the jury at trial.  The jury was never asked to consider whether the information in MFI 4, without that contained in particular (f), had the quality which the information as a whole was required to have in order to substantiate counts 3 and 4.  There is a certain unreality in this proposition being raised by the Crown for the first time on appeal.  In any event, the proposition should be rejected.
199The particular (f) information made a real difference to the substance of the information as charged.  The share price value comparison in (f) gave the more general information in MFI 4 a particular focus.  It gave to the other information in MFI 4 a real commercial flavour.  It converted general information as to CSG and its reserves in Queensland being valuable into a particular focus upon QGC shares, their undervalue and the implicit advantage in acquiring them before the true value was realised.  That was in the context of identifying the ""Queensland opportunity"" and the likelihood of entering into some relationship with QGC.
200The case put by the Crown on appeal to the effect that in the absence of the particular (f) information, the remaining information in MFI 4 was sufficient to establish counts 3 and 4, significantly departed from the way in which the case was run at trial.  It was not open to the Crown on appeal to make out another case, different to that put at trial, as to matters which might be material.  The question remained that posed by the trial judge ""whether the accused possessed the substance of that information taken as a whole or in combination except any part of the information that you consider makes no real difference"".  For the reasons indicated, that referred to MFI 4 and included the particular (f) information.  That is a very different inquiry to one which says ""can you put together some other combination of information drawing on parts of MFI 4 which might satisfy the counts which have been charged"".
201It is a fundamental proposition that an accused is entitled to know the case against him or her.  Here it was that the information in MFI 4 was in his possession and that it was material.  In such circumstances, the accused was entitled to give evidence that he did not have part of the information in MFI 4 and that the information which he did not have was of real importance.  The accused did not have to answer permutations of other information not included in MFI 4.
202This was the effect of the Crown submission at [168 - 169] hereof.  There, the Crown submitted that absent the particular (f) information, the remaining information in MFI 4 was to the effect that the ""monolithic BG"" was to enter into a co-operative arrangement or relationship with the ""diminutive QGC"" and that that of itself would be sufficient to permit a conclusion as to materiality and inside information.
203Even if it were open to the Crown to put this submission on appeal, the submission is not made out.  The Crown relied upon the meeting between the applicant and Mr Maxwell in Singapore on 27 November, together with the sequence of events preceding and following the meeting, to provide the factual basis for the submission.  Even though ""Project Honey"" was in contemplation at this time, it was not put by the Crown that the applicant knew what ""Project Honey"" meant before the QGC shares were acquired.  The evidence from Mr Maxwell at trial as to what was said at the dinner was very general.  It was also somewhat undermined by its inconsistency with what he said to ASIC in December 2008.  In December 2008 he denied any recollection of what was said.
204The emails to which the Court was taken between Mr Maxwell and the applicant following the meeting were also expressed in general terms.  Significantly, nowhere do those emails show QGC as having been singled out as a target for some kind of co-operative arrangement or relationship.  On the contrary, the emails start with the four target companies (AB 1, p 289) and there was nothing in the subsequent emails to show that QGC had in any way been singled out.  Arrow was not put forward as the least attractive of the four companies but was put forward as one of the four.  There was nothing in the emails to show that any one of the four companies had been discarded.
205The emails and internal documents of BG at this time, i.e. up to and including 2 December 2007, made it clear that insofar as Mr Maxwell and the team were concerned they were in the ""create phase"" to use the terminology current within BG.  It was common ground that the ""create phase"" was the first phase of the five phases which had to be completed before a project was entered into.  Each one of those phases required the persuasion and approval of the relevant decision makers within BG.  Mr Maxwell was not a relevant decision maker.  
206It follows that the factual basis for the Crown's alternative submission on the appeal, if the information in particular (f) was disregarded, has not been made out.
Ground of Appeal 3
207In the course of argument on the appeal, the Crown accepted that if the Court found that the applicant did not possess the information in particular (f) of MFI 4 at the time when the QGC shares were acquired it would be difficult for the Crown to rely upon the evidence of Mr Dreyfus.  This is because the opinion of Mr Dreyfus was based upon possession of the whole of the information in MFI 4 without any differentiation.  
208That, however, does not end the matter.  As the parties accepted, the question of materiality must be measured against both reasonableness and some knowledge of the market.  The reasonableness test was one well within the province of the jury and did not necessarily need to be based on expert evidence such as that of Mr Dreyfus.  This is despite the fact that the statute refers to ""persons who commonly acquire Division 3 financial products"" which requires the reasonableness test to be applied by reference to a reasonable person armed with some knowledge of matters likely to influence the trading decisions of such persons.  The parties accepted that this was an issue which drew in part upon matters of common sense but which could also be the subject of specialised knowledge.
209In this case, I have found that the applicant did not possess the information in particular (f).  The question is therefore whether it was open to the jury to find materiality by reference to matters of common sense.
210Reliance upon common sense alone without some expert evidence would create a very difficult task for the jury on the facts of this case.  There were two significant confounding considerations militating against a finding of materiality.  The first was that the material extracted by the applicant from Exhibit 4 made it clear that the fact that QGC was undervalued was known by some in the market and had been published in articles which were readily available to the public.  It was also generally known that BG was interested in and was making inquiries about, an involvement in CSG production in Queensland.  In those circumstances, a reasonable person would not have expected that information to have a material effect on the price or value of the QGC shares.   This is particularly so if the particular (f) information was not taken into account.
211The second consideration is the very general nature of the information in MFI 4, especially when particular (f) is left out of the account.   Much more would need to be known about BG's intentions in relation to CSG in Queensland.  MFI 4, absent particular (f), does no more than to indicate such an interest.  The evidence in relation to that interest showed that four CSG companies were under consideration.  This was not one of those cases where the intention of a large company such as BG towards a smaller company such as QGC was so clear that an inference based on common sense could be drawn.  
212None of the information in MFI 4 was directed to the terms of any possible relationship between BG and QGC or any of the other three companies.  It is difficult to identify anything in the information in MFI 4 absent particular (f), which would influence, or be likely to influence relevantly, the decision to acquire securities in QGC.  For that circumstance to exist, one would need to have some knowledge of the nature of the proposed arrangement and its terms. 
213It follows that I am left with a reasonable doubt that if the information in MFI 4 (absent particular (f)) were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of QGC shares or would be likely to influence persons who commonly acquire such shares in deciding whether or not to do so in the case of QGC.  That being a doubt which I have, the jury should have had the same doubt.  This is not a doubt which can be resolved by the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence.
214The fact that the QGC share price increased after the announcement in February 2008 does not remove the doubt which I have.  This is because of the more or less contemporaneous announcement of substantial additional gas reserves held by QGC and because the terms of the arrangement between BG and QGC were known at that time, rather than being in the inchoate state which they were in on 2 December.  The submissions of the applicant at [159] - [160] hereof are compelling.
215It is for these reasons that the Court made the orders which it did on 17 July 2013 (see par [6] hereof).
216SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		20 November 2013",2013-11-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762792,R v Cupples [2013] NSWDC 283,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Jonathan Cupples appears for sentence today on two matters, both offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The first is an offence of using a carriage service to transmit an indecent communication. That is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. In this case, the indecent communication that Mr Cupples transmitted was nine photographs of his erect penis. 

2The second offence is one of using a carriage service to solicit child pornographic material. That is a more serious offence, carrying a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment, and it relates to him soliciting two young girls, one aged eight and one aged eleven, but who said she was twelve, to show him their genitals. 

3I will not use the names of the complainants in these remarks on sentence. I have already prohibited publication of their names. I will call them victim A and victim B. 

4Victim A's sister signed into MSN and received a message from the offender who was using a pseudonym and who falsely pretended that he was twenty years of age when he was in fact twenty-eight. Nothing untoward apparently occurred on that occasion but a short time later victim A, who was eight, and victim B, who was eleven (but said she was twelve when she communicated with the offender), used victim A's sister's computer. They wanted to go onto Facebook but in the course of their use of that computer a message was received on MSN from the offender, still using his pseudonym. 

5The victims began to chat with the offender. Importantly, victim A gave her real name and real age. The older victim, perhaps more wiser, gave a pseudonym. The web cam was operating and so the offender could see both the victims. He thus well knew that the people to whom he was communicating were children and thus vulnerable to exploitation. The vulnerability of victim A of course is made clear by the circumstance that she identified her real name and correct personal details about herself. 

6The offender actually asked that the two complainants meet up with him. Fortunately they declined. 

7At some stage during this conversation it is disturbing to understand that Mr Cupples must have got an erection. He then took a photograph of it, in fact nine photographs, and sent these to victim A and victim B. That is the first of the offences.

8He then asked the victims to show him what he described as their ""pussy"". The victims then made a video of themselves using the web cam. They danced in front of the web cam with their underwear pulled down and exposing their genital areas. That is the second offence, one of using a carriage service to solicit child pornography material.

9In August, some months later, police attended the offender's premises and executed search warrants. They seized his computer and conducted an investigation of it. He declined to answer questions put to him by police. 

10In some ways the first of these offences is akin to the relatively common but still disturbing aspect of public life described as ""flashing"", but this is more serious than that because, using the Internet, the offender was able to penetrate the sanctity of the victims' home and he was, as the second offence demonstrated, able to persuade naïve, young children to engage in sexual behaviour over the Internet. On top of that, there was of course the request to meet up with the young girls, which they fortunately declined. There is no doubt that there is a grave risk of harm to victims from behaviour such as this. It is for that reason that the legislation and the courts treat offences such as this as seriously as they do.

11I mentioned before that the offender was twenty-eight years of age. He has no other criminal history. In some ways his upbringing is unremarkable but in other ways he is unusual. In common with many other people in the community, his parents separated when he was a child and some difficulties arose as a result of that. But less commonly there are a number of other circumstances which deserve mention.

12Firstly, and most obviously, Mr Cupples suffers from scoliosis. He has had operations to have metal rods inserted into his spine but the effects of that condition are obvious. He is only five foot three and relatively small in build. Less obvious are the other events that have affected Mr Cupples in his life. He himself was the victim of sexual assault. He was also a witness to a murder and, on top of that, was a witness to a fatal motor vehicle accident where he was involved in attempts to save the life of the victim of that collision. Not surprisingly, these events have had a substantial impact upon Mr Cupples. 

13At the time of his offending he appears to have been at something of a low point, feeling socially isolated and seeking out younger people on the Internet in an effort to avoid rejection. 

14He has been seen by a psychologist who prepared a report for the Court. In one particular aspect the psychological opinion is probably a bit over-optimistic. The psychologist reports that it was his opinion that Mr Cupples showed his penis to the young girls because that part of his body ""represented for him one part of his body that he could be proud of"". In truth, as Mr Healey acknowledged, that fails to take account of what Mr Cupples was really up to; engaging in sexual behaviour with young girls. He took a photo of his erect penis, in fact nine photos, precisely because it was a sexual organ, not because it was ""one part of his body that he could be proud of"". 

15Mr Cupples has seen other psychologists too for the purpose of preparing a presentence report. There is significant assistance that can be provided to Mr Cupples by way of courses and treatment, whether he receives a custodial sentence or otherwise. 

16Mr Cupples' behaviour is obviously of grave concern. It is disturbing that a twenty-eight year old man would gain an erection when discussing things over the Internet with a girl of eight and either eleven or twelve. It is to be hoped that these offences will be isolated. It is to be hoped that never again will Mr Cupples engage in sexual offending involving young children. 

17I will do what I can to bring about that result. Of course, I do not do this as a favour for Mr Cupples. I do that to minimise the risk of future harm being occasioned to young children, and I hope to bring about a situation where
Mr Cupples does not offend in this way again, by promoting both his rehabilitation, and also personally deterring him. 

18Mr Healey has submitted that an appropriate outcome would be the imposition of an intensive corrections order, implicitly submitting that a sentence of imprisonment was required but that it would be two years or less. Whilst the Crown's primary position is that fulltime custody is appropriate, the Crown also concedes that an ICO is within range, again implicitly accepting that a sentence of imprisonment of two years or less is appropriate. 

19I propose to impose such a sentence on Mr Cupples should he be assessed as suitable. An ICO is not a walk in the park. Unlike a suspended sentence, it does carry with it an aspect of punishment but there is also considerable scope for participation by Mr Cupples in the courses referred to in the presentence report which will aid his rehabilitation.

20I should say that I have taken into account that Mr Cupples pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and thus his willingness to facilitate the course of justice is something that I have taken into account. 

21The matter is adjourned until 28 February, at 2 o'clock in Sydney.

22Having decided that it is likely that a sentence of two year or less will be imposed upon him, I will refer him for assessment as to suitability to serve that sentence by way of an ICO.

		21 February 2014",2013-11-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762801,Firth v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWCA 403,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA: I invite Leeming JA to give the first judgment. 

2LEEMING JA: By amended summons filed 25 March 2013 the applicant, Mr William Firth, claims these orders:

""1) Quash all Lower Court judgements.
2) Costs of Lower Court fines, court costs, representation costs & transcriptions.
3) Damages in, and from, miscarriages of justice."" 

3Although the applicant was legally represented in the Local Court and the District Court, his amended summons appears to have been drafted by him without legal assistance and he has appeared today in person. His written submissions confirm that he wishes to challenge two judgments of the District Court made on 1 August 2011, being appeals from two driving offences of which he was convicted in the Local Court on 28 January 2011 and sentenced on 7 March 2011, as well as the refusal by Payne DCJ to state a case pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

4Proceedings were commenced against the applicant by Court Attendance Notice dated 8 October 2010 for refusing to undergo a breath test, failing to undergo breath analysis, and driving while under the influence of alcohol. On the same day he was issued with a ""Notice of Suspension of Authority to Drive in NSW"" with effect on and from 8 October 2010 until the charges had been heard and determined. He refused to sign that notice, something to which I will return. 

5There was a hearing in the Tamworth Local Court on 1 December 2010, which was not completed and was stood over for further hearing on 28 January 2011. At the conclusion of the hearing the Magistrate said: 

""so the Court Attendance Notice is to continue, but so is the suspension of your entitlement to drive, so don't drive anything between now and 28 January, OK."" 

6On 18 January 2011 the applicant was charged with driving while suspended, and on 24 January Mr Firth entered a plea of guilty to that charge. On 28 January 2011 Mr Firth was convicted of the charge of failing to undergo a breath test contrary to s 13(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The prosecutor withdrew the charge of failing to undergo breath analysis, and the charge of driving under the influence was dismissed. 

7On 7 March 2011, when the proceedings returned for sentence, the Magistrate refused leave to withdraw Mr Firth's guilty plea to the charge of driving while suspended. Mr Firth was fined $200 and $400 respectively and disqualified for 12 months. 

8Mr Firth appealed from the charges of which he had been convicted to the District Court by Notice of Appeal dated 4 April 2011. He also sought leave to appeal from the conviction for driving whilst suspended, to which he had pleaded guilty. Leave to appeal was granted. The appeal was heard in the Tamworth District Court on 1 August 2011 and the challenge to each conviction was heard and determined separately by her Honour Payne DCJ on 1 August 2011. 

9In relation to the conviction under s 13(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act, Mr Firth evidently adduced medical evidence directed to his being unable to undertake the breath test. Her Honour said: 

""I have looked at the medical evidence and I've looked at the totality of the evidence. I accept that he may not have understood the effect of the beta blocker but it was all of his behaviour on this night that raises concerns about his veracity in terms of undertaking the test. The onus is on the appellant in terms of the defendant satisfying the Court that he was unable to do so on medical grounds and the Court has a report. That is on the balance of probabilities. The highest the report says, ""It therefore may"" - and I emphasise ""may"", interfere with Mr Firth's forced exhalation of air to complete a demand to exhale a certain volume of air continuously."" It does not say it will, or would have, it may. 

In all the circumstances of this case I am not - and I know that he gave sworn evidence that that was the position - but I am not satisfied, even on the balance of probabilities, and find him guilty of the offence."" 

10In relation to the conviction of driving while suspended, contrary to s 25A(2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998, her Honour rejected the argument that because the prosecutor had withdrawn the offence of refusing breath analysis there was no valid suspension of his licence, with the consequence that when Mr Firth drove during the suspension period there could be no offence. Her Honour said:

""With respect to him, that just cannot be so. He was charged with the offence pursuant to s 205 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 and immediate suspension came into play. He was properly suspended and remained suspended until the matter was dealt with by a court or otherwise. As I understand it, he drove before it was withdrawn."" 

11Following a request by Mr Firth, her Honour revised both judgments and issued them on 27 September 2011. However, not until 26 June 2012 did Mr Firth, now without the benefit of legal representation, apply for her Honour to state a case pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. His application was in these terms:

""A Stated Case is sought as in:

A. There was error in law in not applying the dual criteria of Section 141 - Evidence Act to the opinion provided in the Doctor's Certificate.

B. There was error in law in citing the procedural provisions of Sect 205 [Road Transport (General) Act 2005]

* to hold that a certified breath concentration of alcohol existed.

* to hold that certification under Sect 14 and Sect 32 - Road Transport (Safety & Traffic Management) Act 1999 - was in evidence. 

* to hold that the suspension by the police officer was lawful.

* to hold that the suspensions by the lower court were lawful.

each under the Road Transport (Safety & Traffic Management) Act 1999.""

12That application was heard on 26 June 2012, after which Payne DCJ delivered an ex tempore judgment. At the outset her Honour said, ""The applicant for the stated case is unrepresented and I bear this strongly in mind."" Her Honour rejected the submission that the application was vexatious, saying that: ""I believe Mr Firth in his own mind is convinced he has been dealt with unjustly and has done his best as an unrepresented person to bring the matter before the Court."" However, her Honour found that his application did not disclose a question of law, and further considered that it was baseless. She concluded:

""I further add that I am of the view that the Court of Criminal Appeal would refuse to grant an extension of time but that is only one of the factors. In my view, to bring this matter before the Court of Criminal Appeal would indeed be an abuse of process, and despite the genuineness with which Mr Firth comes before the Court and the difficulties of unrepresented persons, I am of the view that the application for the stated case should be refused."" 

13Mr Firth's summons in this Court was filed on 28 January 2013 in materially identical terms to his amended summons, which also joins the District Court in addition to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

14No appeal lies to this Court from a decision of the District Court in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction, for the appeal is not an ""action"" within the meaning of s 127 of the District Court Act 1973 (see Muldoon v Church of England Children's Homes Burwood (2011) 80 NSWLR 202 at [11]). Nor do the rights of appeal conferred by ss 5 and 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, (which apply to convictions in the District Court either on indictment or in its summary jurisdiction) extend to decisions of the District Court on appeals against convictions by the Local Court. However, this Court's supervisory jurisdiction remains, subject to the effect of s 176 of the District Court Act. 

15Further, there has long been held to be an obligation upon a Judge of the District Court to submit a question of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Macfarlan JA has recently collected the provisions and authorities in Landsman v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWCA 369 at [15]-[18] and noted that because no appeal lies, the ability and duty of a District Court Judge to submit a question of law in an appeal to that Court in its criminal jurisdiction is of considerable importance. As that case shows, that duty is enforceable in the exercise of this Court's supervisory jurisdiction. It is this Court's supervisory jurisdiction that Mr Firth has invoked by his amended summons. Because Mr Firth seeks to review the decision of a Judge of the District Court, his proceeding is assigned to the Court of Appeal: see s 48 of the Supreme Court Act). 

16However, Mr Firth must fail unless he can establish judicially reviewable error on the part of Payne DCJ on 1 August 2011 or 26 June 2012. It is sufficient for present purposes to put entirely to one side the lengthy, and unexplained, delays that occurred prior to the application to state a case, and prior to commencing proceedings in this Court. Mr Firth's summons can be readily determined on its merits.

17First, in relation to the dismissal of the appeal against the conviction for failure to undergo a breath test, her Honour with respect correctly stated that the onus lay upon Mr Firth to satisfy that he was ""unable on medical grounds at the time the defendant was required to do so, to undergo a breath test."" Her Honour examined the evidence and formed the view that he had failed to discharge that onus. Mr Firth today said that there were no reasons, or alternatively no adequate reasons. I disagree. Her Honour's reasons disclose no judicially reviewable error. They merely disclose her Honour making a finding of fact based on the evidence before her. Indeed, so far as I can see, they disclose no error at all. The real gravamen of Mr Firth's complaint is that her Honour erred in not being satisfied that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether on medical grounds he was not required to take the test. That submission must be rejected: section 13(3) places the burden upon the defendant to make out this defence. There were other attacks made against the decision in Mr Firth's written submissions, which were not developed orally. They included that her Honour was biased, failed to accept expert evidence, and erred as to the meaning of onus. I am not being exhaustive, but giving those three examples. None of those have any foundation based on the material before this Court.

18In relation to her Honour's second decision on 1 August 2011, Mr Firth advances, in written submissions and orally, quite elaborate arguments, all of which pre-suppose either that his suspension was at all times void, or alternatively was withdrawn with retrospective effect when the failure to undergo the breath analysis charge was withdrawn on 28 January 2011. In Court today he has referred to that being a purported charge. He has referred to the charge being done unlawfully. He has said that there was no such charge at law. He has also referred to the fact that he refused to sign the Notice of Suspension of Authority to Drive in NSW. That, in my view, adds nothing to the argument that he wishes to advance. 

19In written submissions he has said:

""There was no antecedent to match up with the said ""withdrawal"" which cannot itself invent an offence to then become a lawful basis for a charge. Withdrawal of a charge must carry with it any presumed basis for suspension. Any such withdrawal must be retroactive. It cannot gather validity for suspension along the way. Suspension cannot be live without lawful supporting offence.""

20He has, in addition, relied upon s 7(2)(b) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act. That, with respect to Mr Firth, has nothing to do with the matter. Orally, he has said that the laying of the charge was an abuse of process and caused a miscarriage of justice. All of those submissions must be rejected. Counsel for the DPP told us, and there is nothing in the material as far as I can see that undermines what we were told, that the question whether the officer serving the Court Attendance Notice had failed to have the requisite suspicion that Mr Firth had committed a charge, had not been agitated in the courts below. 

21Much was made by Mr Firth of s 172(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The difficulty that Mr Firth has is that s 205 of the Road Transport (General) Act in subs (7) provides:

""For the purpose of this section:

(a) A person is charged with an offence when particulars of the offence are notified in writing to the person by a police officer.""

22That is what occurred. There was no dispute that that occurred in any of the courts below. It followed that s 205(1)(b) was engaged. It further followed that the Magistrate was, with respect, right to tell Mr Firth on 1 December 2010 that his suspension continued in force, which is also the plain wording of the notice, which provided:

""YOUR NSW DRIVER LICENCE ... IS SUSPENDED ON AND FROM 8/10/2020 ... UNTIL THE CHARGE AS SHOWN ABOVE IS HEARD AND DETERMINED BY A COURT OR UNTIL THE CHARGE IS WITHDRAWN (if that should happen). YOU MUST NOT DRIVE ON A ROAD OR ROAD RELATED AREA DURING THE PERIOD OF SUSPENSION.""

23As I have said, s 205 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 empowers a police officer ""at any time within 48 hours after the person has been charged, give the person a suspension notice"". The pre-condition to that statutory power is that the person has been charged by a police officer with one of the offences listed in s 205(1)(a) or (b). One of those offences is an offence under s 15(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The availability of the power does not turn upon the person being convicted of the offence with which he or she has been charged. It turns upon his or her having been charged. That is what occurred in this case. It is not necessary for the purposes of this proceeding to consider the status of the suspension notice if a charge has been made but withdrawn, yet not formally dismissed. The charge which enlivened the power had not been withdrawn when on 18 January 2011 Mr Firth was charged with driving while suspended. Her Honour was, in my view, unquestionably correct to dismiss the appeal. 

24In relation to the third decision, to refuse to submit a question of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal, it is plain that her Honour (a) decided the matter on the merits rather than on the lengthy and unexplained delay, (although her Honour also referred to that delay) and (b) approach the proposed stated case charitably having regard to Mr Firth's lack of representation. In my view no error is disclosed by her Honour forming the view that what was proposed was baseless, nor is any error disclosed in her Honour's view that bringing the matter before the Court of Criminal Appeal would be an abuse of process. 

25For those reasons, no judicially reviewable error is shown in any of her Honour's decision. It is not necessary to address the further obstacle faced by Mr Firth, s 176 of the District Court Act, although as was pointed out by the first respondent, it has long been held that that provision requires jurisdictional error to be demonstrated: see Garde v Dowd [2011] NSWCA 115; 80 NSWLR 620 at [10]; Mahmoud v Sutherland [2012] NSWCA 306 at [7]-8] and [51]; and Landsman at [13] and [37]. 

26For those reasons I propose that the amended summons dated 25 March 2013 be dismissed. Although charged and convicted of criminal offences, the applicant has invoked this Court's civil jurisdiction and there is nothing to displace the ordinary rule in civil litigation that costs follow the event. I therefore proposed that the amended summons be dismissed with costs. 

27SACKVILLE AJA: I agree with the reasons given by Leeming JA and with the orders that his Honour proposes. I will only add this comment. It is perhaps possible that if the police officer laying the charge that provided the basis for the suspension notice issued under s 205(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 did not hold a genuine suspicion that the offence had been committed, the laying of the charge might not have sustained the suspension notice. However, as Leeming JA has explained, the issue of whether the police officer had the requisite suspicion was never in contest in the proceedings in the Local Court or the District Court. 

28EMMETT JA: For the reasons given by Leeming JA and the observation made by Sackville AJA, I agree that the proceedings should be dismissed with costs. The orders of the Court are these:

(1) The proceedings be dismissed.
(2) The plaintiff pay the costs of the first defendant.

		28 November 2013",2013-11-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2762807,"INEGBEDION, Meredith v R [2013] NSWCCA 291","Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J and the orders which he proposes.

2ROTHMAN J: The appellant, Meredith Inegbedion, appeals his conviction by a jury of the offence of attempting to possess a marketable quantity of unlawfully imported substance, being a border controlled drug, namely heroin, contrary to s 307.6(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code). 

3The appellant raises two grounds:

Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the trial judge's directions to the jury in relation to attempt. 

Ground 2: The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence. 

Brief summary of facts

4It is possible, at least in summary form, to state the facts. The primary facts are largely uncontentious. 

5On 8 April 2010, a package addressed to David Okeke, 16 Wolseley Street, Rooty Hill, and containing heroin, was intercepted by Customs Officers. 

6On 12 April 2010, officers of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) went to Wolseley Street for the purpose of identifying and apprehending the recipient or recipients of the package. An AFP officer, Stephanie Leonard, posed as an employee of Australia Post. 

7As she walked towards the front door of the premises, the appellant's co-accused, Peter Uadiale, approached her and asked if she had a package for David Okeke. She replied in the affirmative. They travelled together to her van to collect the package and he was arrested. 

8Prior to the approach by Mr Uadiale to the AFP officer, the appellant and Mr Uadiale were observed by other AFP officers to be seated together in a car parked further down the street. When Mr Uadiale attempted to flee, following his conversation with AFP officer Leonard, the car, driven by the appellant, started moving, and was intercepted by the AFP. 

9The car was searched and in it was found: a piece of paper in the appellant's wallet on which the name David Okeke was written; a Bible containing a piece of paper on which Sekaswi John Malaysia (the name and location of a person to whom international money transfers were effected in the name of David Okeke) was written; and $11,100 in cash. 

10The appellant was charged; was tried; and, on 14 November 2011, was convicted. The appellant was sentenced on 3 April 2012. There is no appeal against sentence. 

Ground 1: Trial judge's directions in relation to attempt 

11Pursuant to the provisions of s 11.1 of the Code, an attempt to commit what is otherwise a Commonwealth offence is, itself, an offence under the Code. The relevant provisions of s 11.1 of the Code should be recited:

""11.1 Attempt 

(1) A person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed. 

(2) For the person to be guilty, the person's conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact. 

(3) For the offence of attempting to commit an offence, intention and knowledge are fault elements in relation to each physical element of the offence attempted. 

Note: Under section 3.2, only one of the fault elements of intention or knowledge would need to be established in respect of each physical element of the offence attempted. 

...

(4) A person may be found guilty even if: 


(a) committing the offence attempted is impossible; or 
(b) the person actually committed the offence attempted. 

... 

(7) It is not an offence to attempt to commit an offence against section 11.2 (complicity and common purpose), section 11.2A (joint commission), section 11.3 (commission by proxy), section 11.5 (conspiracy to commit an offence) or section 135.4 (conspiracy to defraud).""

12It is not particularly contentious to summarise the provisions of s 307.6 of the Code as creating an offence for a person to possess a substance that was unlawfully imported, which substance is a border controlled drug of a marketable quantity. Heroin is a border controlled drug and the quantity involved in these proceedings is a marketable quantity. It is unnecessary to recite the terms of s 307.6 of the Code. 

13It is appropriate next to refer to fundamental principle. With the exception of offences of strict or absolute liability, criminal responsibility depends upon two aspects: a criminal act and a criminal intention. It is generally true to say, as Brennan J said in He Kaw Teh v R [1985] HCA 43; (1985) 157 CLR 523 (He Kaw Teh), ""that an act or omission done or made by a person is the essential foundation of his criminal responsibility"". As his Honour went on to explain:

""When a statute creates and defines an offence only by reference to its external elements, a mental element is usually implied in the definition. A person who engages in prohibited conduct is not criminally responsible for it unless the mental element is present."" (He Kaw Teh, at 565, per Brennan J.)

14It is absolutely essential, in indictments other than particular statutory offences, that the two elements of an offence be understood and proved by the Crown. Those two elements are, as stated above, a criminal act and a guilty mind (actus reus and mens rea). 

15When one is dealing with an attempt to commit an offence, this can sometimes take on a particular difficulty. Depending upon the offence that is attempted, different requirements are imposed on the state of mind. Under the common law, and prior to the promulgation, relevantly, of s 11.1 of the Code, an attempt to commit an offence was a misdemeanour. Nevertheless, both under Commonwealth law (see s 11.1 of the Code above) and under most state laws, an attempt to commit an offence is an offence of the same order. 

16In order to prove that the accused is guilty of an attempt to commit a particular offence, the Crown must first prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused intended to commit the crime, which the Crown alleges he attempted to commit. In other words, the accused must have intended to commit all of the physical acts which would constitute the crime attempted in circumstances which make those acts criminal. 

17Over and above the proof of an intention to commit the crime alleged, the Crown must also prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused, with that intention, performed some act that went towards the commission of the offence, which act was more than merely preparatory of the crime and was immediately connected with the commission of that crime, having no reasonable purpose other than its commission.

18In crimes of specific intent, an intention to commit the crime must include in the state of mind that specific intent. Thus, in a charge of attempted murder, the Crown must prove an intention to kill, not inflict grievous bodily harm: Knight v R [1992] HCA 56; (1992) 175 CLR 495.

19The general issue associated with the existence of both a criminal act and a criminal mind applies equally, perhaps even more obviously, to an attempt. While recklessness as to the probable and/or foreseen consequence will suffice for almost all offences, it will be insufficient to satisfy the mental element in attempt (or, irrelevantly, aiding and abetting and other like bases for liability): Giorgianni v R [1985] HCA 29; (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 506, per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ. Often the difference will be more theoretical than practical, because an intention can be inferred from conduct that has known consequences. 

20Nevertheless, there are two separate aspects to the crime of attempt. As earlier stated, the first such aspect is the state of mind or intention to commit the crime; the second aspect is conduct which is a step towards the commission of the offence in question and which step cannot reasonably be regarded as having any other purpose than the commission of the offence charged. 

21Over the years there have been a number of attempts to define that which is a step towards the commission of an offence that does not have any other reasonable purpose than the commission of the offence. Often the relationship is referred to as an unequivocal act as a test of proximity: see Davey v Lee [1968] 1 QB 366. In other words, is the act upon which the criminal conduct rests an act that is too remote to constitute an attempt, which question is then answered by the answer to whether the act is directed to the commission of the particular offence or completed crime only. 

22The existence of two separate aspects, the state of mind and conduct amounting to attempt, is the basis for the allegation of error said to arise from the directions of the learned trial judge. The appellant submits, in this Court, that the direction given to the jury by the trial judge gave ""rise to a miscarriage of justice ... [being] ... the conflation of attempt and intent, with the consequent diminution, if not obviation, of the need by the prosecution to prove the physical element of the offence"". 

23It is necessary to deal with some of the extracts of his Honour's summation and directions to the jury. Before doing so it is necessary to point out that there was an exchange between counsel for the accused, at trial, and his Honour in which these aspects were discussed, prior to the summation. This exchange occurred on the day prior to his Honour's summing up at p 394 - 397 of the Transcript (AB Volume 2, 430 - 433, 10/11/11). 

24Relevantly the exchanges are in the following terms:

""EDWARDS: Your Honour, my position is that the physical and fault elements that are required to make out this offence are required to be attributed to the accused. That's my position. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I agree with that. 

HIS HONOUR: I think we all agree with that. 

EDWARDS: And that is whatever he alleged to have done, which is to be in the car, the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that constituted an attempt to possess a package. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: His intention to attempt to - that's right, I accept that. 

HIS HONOUR: That's an intention. Well he's being in the car at the scene--

...

EDWARDS: ... In my submissions it's - I apologise for saying no your Honour. Your Honour, an attempt is--

HIS HONOUR: An attempt is an intent. He intends to possess. 

...

HIS HONOUR: Attempt must be intend. That's what the law is as to the attempt. 

EDWARDS: Because your Honour, they'll be given the direction ultimately. The question whether the conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact. So the jury are told that the person's conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes. We all agree with that. 

EDWARDS: So it's an attempt to possess. So an intention could occur at any stage of a person's involvement in an offence, and it could occur in a context where is it merely--

HIS HONOUR: You just must intent [sic] but you must go to through those physical - the physical act, facts upon which the Crown relies. 

EDWARDS: Yes your Honour. 

...

HIS HONOUR: But in any event, yes. Possession, yes. Possession of a thing includes receiving, having control or obtaining possession. Yes. 

...

EDWARDS: So what I would submit to your Honour, that its more in fact than an intention. A physical element has to be an attempt which involves, in my submission, more than an intention but requires an intention, if I can put it like that. Certainly your Honour, you don't--

HIS HONOUR: Under 3.2 only one of the four elements of intention or knowledge would need to be established in respect of each physical element of the offence attempted. 

...

HIS HONOUR: An intention is that, yes. 

...

HIS HONOUR: Yes, the fault element is intention. 

...

EDWARDS: Yes, your Honour, but in terms of the - we see in the attempt it talks about the conduct and, your Honour, the conduct in this case, as I understand the Crown case, is that the accused was outside driving along the street, along Wolseley Street at the time Mr Uadiale got the package. Now, if that's accepted by the jury they would have to be satisfied that that constitutes an attempt. So it's the conduct that is in my submission--

HIS HONOUR: Well, it's just not the occasion when he's coming back, there's the earlier point of time when Sergeant Davenport said he saw him in the car. 

EDWARDS: Yes, your Honour

HIS HONOUR: And also I think it was Saunders, he actually didn't say - he said parked, I'm not too certain if Sergeant Davenport said parked, I was going to transcript, and I think certainly Saunders said parked, saw him parked on the left hand side as he was driving down Wolseley Street. 

...

HIS HONOUR: Yes, but certainly that would be I take it the Crowns relying upon that evidence to show an intention to possess. 

...

HIS HONOUR: The whole lot, the fault element is intention, it must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence, well that's certainly true, and you could put that.""

25The submission from counsel appearing for the appellant, in this Court, is that this exchange shows his Honour to have ""some difficulty in appreciating"" the need for both physical and fault elements to be proved by the Crown. It is always necessary to be extremely wary of drawing too much from an exchange in transcript for a number of reasons. First, as is clear from the full exchange from which the foregoing is extracted, an exchange between counsel and the Court, in the absence of the jury, is often a means by which a trial judge refines that which is being submitted as the law that is required to be put to the jury in the summing up. 

26Further, in an exchange with counsel that forms part of a much larger discussion, a looseness of expression generally occurs, without which the exchange, necessarily, would take a significantly longer period. 

27Nevertheless, and without regard to the two foregoing considerations, the exchange between counsel and the trial judge, recited or summarised in the above extract, does not reveal a failure of his Honour to appreciate (or a difficulty in appreciating) that both mens rea and actus reus are required in order for the Crown to prove attempt.

28However, in the exchange his Honour, after referring to the evidence of the appellant's conduct, and whether he drove along the road and parked (by reference to the evidence of witnesses Davenport and Saunders) remarked that the Crown would be relying upon that evidence to show an intention to possess, which discloses the kind of looseness one would expect in an exchange with counsel, but a looseness which uses the term ""intention"" in other than its strict legal meaning as a state of mind to be distinguished from conduct. His Honour is there using ""intention to possess"" as meaning ""attempting to possess"". 

29In other than the technical sense, and its ordinary meaning in colloquial English, intending to do something may sometimes include attempting to do something. For example, if a person said, ""I intended to go inside, but the door was locked"", it would ordinarily mean that an attempt was made to open the door. On the other hand, intention can be quite separate (as it is as a matter of law) to an attempt, best illustrated by a statement, ""I intended to go to the beach, but it was raining"". Much depends on context, which emphasises the need for precision in dealing with the issue, as a matter of law, and in directions or summing up to a jury. 

30It is necessary to recite some of the extracts of the summing up of his Honour. It is impossible, in the context of this judgment, to repeat the whole of the summing up or to put the extracts in context. Nevertheless, these include the extracts upon which the appellant relies for this ground of appeal. 

31His Honour, during the course of the summing up said:

""As the Crown has said it is for you as finders of fact to say whether or not Meredith Inegbedion did on12 April 2010 intend to take control of. That is what the words 'attempt to possess' mean. I will say a little bit further more in relation to that and the facts and how you would consider that, but I mention that to you as at this stage. It probably would be as well if I mention it now. The law applicable in this case is that the conduct of the accused on 12 April 2010, that is, the conduct which amounts to intention to take control of, must be more than merely preparatory to commission of an offence, more than preparatory to take control of the substance. 

... The main matter is to focus on the fact that there was intent to take control of, and it must be from conduct that is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence.

...

That is, it is on the Crown to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that on 12 April 2010 the accused intended to take control of exhibit A, the package containing the heroin, and to reject the version that is put forward by the accused. 

The accused does not have to persuade you to accept it, but if that evidence of the accused leaves you with a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the Crown has made out its case in respect of any element of the offence or an essential fact, then you are bound in law to bring in a verdict of not guilty. 

...

The Crown in relation to the intention to possess, take control of the package, relies upon the circumstances as referred to in his address and as he stated the actions of the accused on 12 April 2010 and what was found on his person or in the vehicle on that day, and the links which follow in relation to the name of persons and telephone calls and puts to you that those actions can only, and it can be the only inference, show an intention to possess. 

...

I can say it is a very good example I consider in relation to circumstantial evidence, and it is a good example of what the law requires, that when you have a Crown relying on circumstantial evidence, you must find beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference, the only one, from the circumstances upon which the Crown relies is that the accused on 12 April 2012 [sic] intended to take control of the package, and that his conduct was more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence to possess the prohibited substance. They are the matters, and it can be the only inference that he indeed. The Crown puts to you that when you look at all that occurred on 12 April 2010, including the driving of the vehicle to Wolseley Street, Rooty Hill prior to the arrest, and the circumstances of the arrest and what was found in the vehicle which showed links according to pieces of paper to a person by the name of David Okeke which was the name referred to in package A on the address together with the actual address, which is again on the package, 16 Wolseley Street, Rooty Hill, and the telephone calls and the money transfers as referred to in exhibit J, and the other evidence, which is all before you, would lead you to the only rational inference that on that day, 12 April, he intended to take control of the package. The Crown submits that when you look at all that evidence that is the only rational inference, and that it has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that you ought to reject what the accused has stated as to the reasons why he was at Wolseley Road.

Officer Leonard said:

'I saw from my right an African male come running towards me. That male asked me if I had a package for David Okeke to which I replied ""I do"". I then asked him for identification. At that time he told me that he did not have any identification and I told him that because it was an EMS package that I required identification before I could give him the package.'

She then said:

'Well do you have a tracking number?' And he said he could go and get the tracking number from Vecar [sic - read: the car] , so then I said, ""Okay off you go and go and get the tracking number"". He then went back to my right which was east, up Wolseley Street, disappeared out of sight and then returned with a mobile telephone in his hand and then he read the consignment number, so the tracking number, out to me. I checked it against the package, the tracking number that I had written down, and saw that they were the same. I then asked him to sign the receipt for the package and I asked him if he was David Okeke to which he said, ""Yes"". He then signed the receipt and I asked him if he would come over to the van and I got the package out. I then opened the back sliding door on the passenger side of the van and Federal Agents Brian Chow and Matthew Murray then emerged. We identified ourselves as police.'

Now it is important I consider that that evidence be read out to you because it does, it is the start of the package and it was signed for as we know by Peter Uadiale, not the accused. But nevertheless because of the matters which are referred to and the evidence of other witnesses, particularly the officers, Davenport and Saunders, as to the fact that there was a parked vehicle, that is, the Tiida Vehicle, parked in an area of number 8 Wolseley Road and that was observed prior to Federal Agent Leonard speaking to Uadiale, that that is a circumstance on which the Crown relies, that is, there was a car driven by Mr Matthew Inegbedion and that it was in that area prior to that van attending at 16 Wolseley Street."" [Emphasis added.]

[His Honour then set out the factual material upon which the Crown relied at the end of which, at AB 492, his Honour continued with his summing up.]

""I have referred to that evidence, members of the jury, because the circumstances are matters upon which the Crown relies. And you have heard the evidence of the accused that he went there and that he simply spoke to Mr Uadiale and he was there for about twenty minutes, and then Mr Uadiale got out of the vehicle. He said he went there, you will recall, after he received some telephone calls. He said he went there and he was driving a Tiida because he was involved in an accident, and there is no evidence contrary to his evidence that he was involved in an accident and there is the hire purchase agreement with the Tiida vehicle. 

...

You have also had exhibit 2 marked in red what Mr Inegbedion said he wrote or did not write on the pieces of paper and you have heard the submissions of counsel in that regard. The Crown puts to you that those pieces of paper show links to David Okeke and he is the person to whom the package is addressed and you have heard the submissions of the Crown in that regard, and the telephone calls that were had on 11 April and also the money transfers and the names that were found inside the Bible, exhibit 7, and the reference to those names, and you would look at all the evidence so that the money transfers and through the pieces of paper are linked to those persons, and that you would reject his evidence that he had simply gone there to have a chat with Mr Uadiale and that he had gone there with the express intention of taking control of the package, and it certainly was not a preparatory step to the commission of an offence, and that you would reject the version of the accused."" [Emphasis added.]

32After an exchange with counsel, in the absence of the jury, further directions were given by his Honour. Relevantly, those directions were in the following terms:

""The Crown submits to you that on the established facts as to the accused driving to Wolseley Street, Rooty Hill, on 12 April 2010, and of being there at the time Uadiale was running down the street towards him, as he stated, and turning into the driveway on the opposite side - or the driveway in Wolseley Street in the area which he stated in his exhibits, that he was there not preparing, not taking a preparatory step, but intended to take possession of the prohibited substance. 

...

And the Crown submits that on those facts, those matters, it was not preparatory to any offence him driving there to Wolseley Road, but he was there with the intention of taking possession of the prohibited substance."" [Emphasis added.]

33In Onuorah v R [2009] NSWCCA 238, Hodgson JA discussed the offence of attempt under the Code and, at [30], said:

""If one restricts attention to the elements of the attempted offence, then, in my opinion, in accordance with Britten, the question in truth turns on whether an accused person intends each element of the relevant crime to occur, and in pursuance of that intention does acts that are not merely preparatory but are sufficiently proximate to the intended commission of the crime. Where an element of the relevant offence is that there be a border-controlled drug that has been imported into Australia, then for there to be an attempt there must be an intention that there be such a drug that has been imported; but it is not necessary that this actually be the case.""

The reference to Britten in the foregoing is to Britten v Alpogut [1987] VR 929.

34As can be seen from the extracts of the summing up by the trial judge, there was no occasion when the trial judge expressly referred to two separate elements: the conduct and the state of mind. The trial judge referred to conduct and intention, as can be seen from the extracts, but not in a way that contrasted the nature of the two elements. 

35Nevertheless, the trial judge made clear that the conduct of the appellant towards the commission of the offence had to be more than merely preparatory. He directed the jury expressly that the appellant's conduct had to be ""conduct that is more than preparatory to [the] commission of an offence, more than preparatory to take control of the substance"".

36Further, his Honour emphasised that the jury needed to conclude an intention to commit the offence from the appellant's conduct in order to convict and needed to do that from conduct that was more than preparatory towards the commission of the offence. This Court must assume that the jury followed the trial judge's direction and, if they did, in reaching their verdict, they must have found both the relevant conduct and intention. 

37To the extent that the trial judge, through his directions, confined the jury to considering only conduct more than merely preparatory in determining whether there was the requisite intention, the trial judge unduly restricted the jury's consideration in a manner favourable to the appellant. 

38Nevertheless, the trial judge did not direct the jury to consider separately the requisite conduct and the relevant intention. Nor did he adequately explain the distinction. That failure discloses error. 

Ground 2: Unreasonable verdict and Proviso

39The Crown relies, inter alia, on the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The appellant submits that the verdict is unreasonable ""and cannot be supported on the evidence"". The test for each is similar, the approach of the Court to each is the same, and both submissions should be considered together. 

40As stated at the outset, the primary facts are either wholly or largely uncontentious. The two co-offenders arrived together and parked until the mail van arrived. The appellant's co-offender then approached the person purporting to be the mail delivery officer. 

41When the co-offender sought to flee, the appellant moved the car away. When the AFP searched the car, the name of the intended recipient of the package was in the appellant's wallet, and the car driven by the appellant contained both cash of an amount over $11,000 and the name and the location of the person to whom international money transfers were effected. 

42The appellant submits that only the co-offender approached the mail delivery officer and that his client did not, as a consequence, attempt to possess the package. The appellant also points to the Crown's disavowal of joint criminal enterprise as a basis for the conviction of the appellant. As I understand this latter aspect, the appellant submits that the appellant cannot, therefore, be held accountable for the actions of the co-offender in approaching the officer. 

43As earlier stated, the primary facts (as distinct from inferences arising therefrom, including the state of mind, or the conclusions to be reached) are uncontentious. 

44The test to be applied by this Court, where a convicted person relies upon a ground that asserts the verdict is unreasonable, is whether the Court thinks that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606. The emphasis in the foregoing is that the court assesses the evidence independently and considers itself whether it has a doubt as to the accused's guilt. The test is not one directed at assessing whether evidence exists to support the conviction. Rather, it assumes the latter and assesses whether there is a reasonable doubt arising from the entirety of the evidence. 

45In Singh v R [2011] NSWCCA 100, the Court (Rothman J, Latham and Price JJ agreeing) said:

""[10] The focus must be on the unreasonableness of the verdict, and the term 'unsafe and unsatisfactory', although sometimes still used, ought not be. Further, whether the verdict was 'open to the jury' does not itself, answer the question. The focus of the examination is whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt, which is answered by whether the appellate court has a reasonable doubt that cannot be answered by paying regard to the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence. See also The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 85 ALJR 8. 

[11] Concentration on the expression as to whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt may lead to some confusion. The focus of the enquiry is not whether there is evidence upon which a jury could have convicted (i.e. whether there was evidence of each element of the offence), but whether it was open to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. whether, on all of the evidence, it was open to be satisfied that there was no reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence). 

[12] In examining the issues, it is the evidence as a whole that must be considered; not each part of the evidence in a piecemeal fashion: R v Rasic [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [29].""

And see the subsequent judgment of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400, at [14], where the majority said:

""In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality'. In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"".'""

46Likewise, or conversely, the task in applying the proviso is almost identical. In Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ) said:

""[35] The fundamental task committed to the appellate court by the common form of criminal appeal statute is to decide the appeal. In so far as that task requires considering the proviso, it is not to be undertaken by attempting to predict what a jury (whether the jury at trial or some hypothetical future jury) would or might do. Rather, in applying the proviso, the task is to decide whether a 'substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred'. 

[36] By hypothesis, when the proviso falls for consideration, the appellate court has decided that there was some irregularity at trial. If there was not, there is no occasion to consider the proviso. In cases, like the present, where evidence that should not have been adduced has been placed before the jury, it will seldom be possible, and rarely if ever profitable, to attempt to work out what the members of the trial jury actually did with that evidence. In cases, like the present, where the evidence that has been wrongly admitted is evidence that is discreditable to the accused, it will almost always be possible to say that that evidence might have affected the jury's view of the accused, or the accused's evidence. And unless we are to return to the Exchequer rule (where any and every departure from trial according to law required a new trial) recognition of the possibility that the trial jury might have used wrongfully received evidence against the accused cannot be treated as conclusive of the question presented by the proviso. 

...

[41] That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognising that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself. 

[42] It is neither right nor useful to attempt to lay down absolute rules or singular tests that are to be applied by an appellate court where it examines the record for itself, beyond the three fundamental propositions mentioned earlier. (The appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; the task is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks; the standard of proof is the criminal standard.) It is not right to attempt to formulate other rules or tests in so far as they distract attention from the statutory test. It is not useful to attempt that task because to do so would likely fail to take proper account of the very wide diversity of circumstances in which the proviso falls for consideration.""

47In a case such as this, the task is easier than in most. The evidence is uncontentious. Having read the evidence, I have no doubt of the kind that would warrant setting aside the verdict because it is unreasonable. There is no reasonable doubt. 

48On the contrary, a reading and analysis of the evidence satisfies me that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred and, notwithstanding the error of the trial judge in insufficiently specifying the necessity for the jury to consider the existence of each of the conduct towards the commission of the offence and of the state of mind to commit the offence, the appeal should be dismissed. 

49Two other matters should be mentioned. First, as earlier mentioned, in the course of submissions, counsel for the appellant relied on the failure of the Crown to put joint criminal enterprise as part of its case against the appellant, or the disavowal, by the Crown, of reliance on joint criminal enterprise. 

50The appellant submitted that, as a consequence of the Crown's conduct of the trial, it (and the Court) could not rely on the conduct of the co-offender in determining whether the appellant's conduct went toward the commission of the offence in a manner that was more than preparatory. 

51In reaching the above conclusions as to the operation of the proviso, it is unnecessary to utilise the final conduct of the co-offender. Nevertheless, the conduct may be utilised without the need to resort to a joint criminal enterprise. 

52For the Crown to have relied on joint criminal enterprise, it would have been required to prove that the appellant and the co-offender reached an agreement (tacit or express) to carry out the offence in which the appellant participated: Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; (2003) 219 CLR 1 at [109]-[110], per Hayne J; Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; (2013) 87 ALJR 434. In Huynh, the Court (French CJ, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Gageler JJ) said:

""[37] The respondent's written submissions acknowledged that joint enterprise liability requires proof of the agreement and of the accused's participation in the enterprise. However, on the hearing of the appeals the respondent resiled from that submission in favour of the contention that 'one plays a part at its most simple by joining into the agreement'. That contention conflated the making of the agreement (whether tacit or express) with participation in its execution and confused liability for conspiracy with liability for the offence that is the subject of the conspiracy. Under the common law the agreement of two or more persons to commit a crime is, without more, a conspiracy. Parties to a conspiracy are liable to conviction for that offence regardless of whether the crime that is the subject of their agreement is committed. The doctrine of joint criminal enterprise provides the means of attaching liability for the agreed crime on all the parties to the agreement regardless of the part played by each in its execution. Of course there will usually be no occasion to have recourse to the doctrine in the case of a party who does some or all of the acts constituting the actus reus. The work done by the doctrine is in making other parties liable for those acts. The principles are as explained by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen. Liability attaches to all the parties to the agreement who participate in some way in furthering its execution."" [Footnotes omitted]

53The jury would have been able to rely on an inference that the co-offender in seeking to collect the package and return it to the car was acting, in part or wholly, as the agent of the appellant (or on his instructions), without evidence of the knowledge of the co-offender or whether he was party to an agreement of the requisite kind. 

54However, in the circumstances, that which was done by the appellant was sufficient to prove guilt without the necessity of relying on the conduct of his co-offender. 

55The second further aspect requiring comment is the operation of s 11.1(7) of the Code. During the course of submissions on the joint criminal enterprise aspect, a brief submission was put relating to its application, given the terms of s 11.2A and s 11.1(7) of the Code. 

56The provisions of s 11.1(7) of the Code understandably exclude relevantly an attempt to commit an offence by common purpose (s 11.2) or joint commission (s 11.2A) or commission by proxy (s 11.3). That is for the obvious reason that, in the case of common purpose, there is either an agreement or there is not. 

57Nevertheless, the converse is not prohibited. A person can be criminally liable by reason of common purpose, joint commission or commission by proxy of an offence which is an attempt. For example, an agreement to commit a murder in which both agreeing parties participate may end ""unsuccessfully"" and the death of the intended victim not eventuate. The parties would be guilty of attempt by joint criminal enterprise. 

58The foregoing two additional comments are not necessary to the conclusion I have reached on this appeal. For the reasons given, I consider there has been error in the summing-up, but there has been no substantial miscarriage or justice and I would exercise the discretion reposed in the Court by operation of the proviso. 

59I propose that the Court issue the following orders:

(1)To the extent necessary, leave to appeal is granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

60McCALLUM J: I have had the benefit of reading, in draft, the judgment of Rothman J. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons stated by his Honour. As to ground 2, I have undertaken the task of making my own independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality, as required in accordance with the principles explained by the High Court in SKA v The Queen. The appellant's contention that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence is based principally on the proposition that, putting aside the evidence of Mr Uadiale approaching Federal Agent Leonard, there was no evidence of any act on the part of the appellant of attempting to possess the drugs other than that he was present in the Tiida van near 16 Wolseley Street. A consideration of the whole of the record of the trial reveals that to be an oversimplification of the Crown case. Even on the appellant's own evidence, he arranged to meet Mr Uadiale in Wolseley Street. He brought $11,000 in cash with him to that meeting. He also brought, in his wallet, the name of the person to whom the parcel was addressed and the consignment number. He parked in Wolseley Street and Mr Uadiale got into the Tiida with him. They sat there together until the Post Australia van arrived, when Mr Uadiale approached Federal Agent Leonard. Mr Uadiale then left Federal Agent Leonard to get the tracking number and returned to her with the number to take delivery of the package. In my view, there was a sufficient evidentiary basis for the physical element of attempting to obtain possession of the parcel. My review of the evidence has not excited any doubt in my mind as to that element of the offence.

61I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J.

2762809,White v R [2013] NSWCCA 242,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Davies J.

2HIDDEN J: An important part of the argument of senior counsel for the applicant was the low grade quality of the substance in this case. It was described in the statement of facts as ""liquid/sludge"" and was found in two containers. One container, found in a waste bin, contained 1.083 kilograms of the substance, with a pure methylamphetamine content of 4.5%. The other container, buried in the garden, contained 2.25 kilograms of the substance, with a purity of 6.5%. Nevertheless, as Davies J has recorded, the total weight of the material was 3.333 kilograms and was of substantial value in the drug market. Senior counsel questioned whether, being in the form of a sludge, it was saleable, but there is nothing in the material before this court to suggest that it was not.

3The reference by the sentencing judge to a causal connection between the applicant's offending and his mental health issues appears to be related to an assessment of the applicant's moral culpability: McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284, per McCallum J at [29], but I agree with Davies J that that issue did not bear upon his Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the offence, as that expression must be understood in the light of Muldrock at [27]. His Honour's approach to the applicant's mental illness was appropriate to the circumstances of the case, and in accordance with authority on that issue.

4I also agree with Davies J that the sentence passed, having regard to the principal offence and to the Form 1 matters, does not convey that his Honour's pre-Muldrock reference to the standard non-parole period has affected it in such a way as to warrant this court's intervention. Nor could it be said to convey a misapprehension by the sentencing judge of the gravity of the offence. Taking into account all the circumstances, objective and subjective, the sentence was within the discretionary range open to his Honour. 

5I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J.

6DAVIES J: On 6 December 2010 the Applicant pleaded guilty in Gosford Local Court to supplying a large commercial quantity (3.33kg) of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000. The offence has a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

7On 12 August 2011 he was sentenced by Judge Ellis in the District Court. He asked Judge Ellis to take into account seven offences on the Form 1 as follows:

(1)Possess a prohibited weapon (a Taser) without a permit - maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment;
(2) Possess anabolic or androgenic steroidal agent namely Stanazol;
(3) Possess restricted substances namely 298 Valium tablets, 150 Xanax tablets, 10 Zolpidem tablets, 1 Mogadon tablet and 2 Viagra tablets;

The maximum penalty for these two offences is 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $2,200. 

(4) Possess a precursor (324 Sudafed and Demazin Pseudoephedrine tablets) for use in manufacturing a prohibited drug; 
(5) Possess drug manufacturing apparatus; 
(6) Possess a precursor (3038g of Iodine) for use in manufacturing a prohibited drug; 
(7) Possess a precursor (14.5g Pseudoephedrine) for use in manufacturing a prohibited drug.

The maximum penalty for these four offences is 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000. 

8His Honour, allowing a discount of 25% for an early plea, sentenced the Applicant to a non-parole period of six years and three months commencing 28 May 2010 and expiring 19 August 2016 with an additional term of three years six months expiring 19 February 2020. (The date of 28 May is an error for 20 May and will be corrected.)

The facts

9Strike Force Goderich was an investigation by the State Crime Command Drug Squad in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs on the Central Coast. During that investigation the Applicant was identified as being involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. 

10Electronic and physical surveillance showed that the Applicant frequently met with numerous persons at short notice and for short periods of time at his residential address at Terrigal as well as other nearby landmarks and locations nominated by him. When attending those meetings the Applicant always travelled to the location other than his residence in a 2004 Toyota Corolla Hatchback. 

11The mobile telephone services used by the Applicant were the subject of lawful telephone interception. They demonstrated an extremely high amount of usage by the Applicant. 

12On the evening of 20 May 2010 a search warrant was executed at the Applicant's premises at Terrigal. He was located inside the lounge room at the time of the execution of the warrant. 

13All of the objects the subject of the eight charges were found in and around the property. Some of the substances later determined to be amphetamine were found in a plastic tub buried in the garden secreted under leaves. Subsequent analysis identified it as methylamphetamine with a 6.5% purity. Its gross weight was 3.333 kgs and its net weight 2.250kg. Its bulk value was estimated between $300,000 and $400,000 with the street value being more than that amount. 

Grounds of appeal

14Although a Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 26 September 2011 the Notice of Appeal was not filed until 6 March 2013. The delay is satisfactorily explained in an affidavit by the Applicant's solicitor. The Crown does not oppose an extension of time. An extension should be granted.

15The Applicant appeals upon three grounds as follows:

Ground 1: His Honour erred in his application of Div 1A of Pt IV of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ss 54A-54B) in the manner in which he had regard to the standard non-parole period provided for the offence.

Ground 2: His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.

Ground 3: The sentence is manifestly excessive.

Subjective features

16The Applicant was born on 25 November 1973. He was aged 37 years at the time of the sentence. He had a minor criminal history in respect of which he had only received non-custodial sentences. There were no drug offences on his record. 

17He was examined by Dr Richard Furst, a forensic psychiatrist, in September 2010. He told Dr Furst that he had a history of substance abuse dating back to his teens commencing with binge drinking until he was 19 years of age. He left school in year 11 and studied sheet metal fabrication at TAFE. 

18There was mental illness in the family with his mother and sister suffering depression and an uncle and cousin diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The cousin committed suicide in 2008. 

19The Applicant was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in his childhood. 

20Dr Furst diagnosed him as having Bipolar Affective Disorder (Type One - Rapid Cycling) and substance abuse disorder. He noted detrimental effects of alcohol and steroids on his mental state with interpersonal difficulties. 

21Dr Furst thought that there were reasonable prospects for his future rehabilitation. He recommended a treatment plan on the basis on a non-custodial sentence. He thought if a custodial sentence was imposed that the Applicant should be referred to a clinical psychologist working within the Department of Corrective Services to deal with the Applicant's childhood maladjustment and his ability to cope with stress without resorting to drugs of abuse. Dr Furst also said the Applicant would benefit from drug and alcohol counselling in custody. 

Grounds 1: The standard non-parole period

22In his Remarks on Sentence (ROS) his Honour said this:

The standard non parole period and the maximum penalty of life imprisonment reflects the community's attitude to offences of this type. The community expects that condign punishment will be imposed upon those who offend in this way. The standard non parole period does not strictly apply because of the plea of guilty but nevertheless it is a guidepost for this Court's assessment of the appropriate penalty and the reality is that there must be some relativity between that standard non parole period and the non parole period imposed just as there must be some reasonable relativity between the maximum penalty and any total sentence that is imposed.

This is not a mathematical sentencing exercise but nevertheless because of the fact that this Court is required to allow percentage discounts as well as to have some relativity to a fixed number such as fifteen it is necessary to consider those aspects although the final sentence to be imposed has been arrived at intuitively as the High Court has said on a number of occasions. 

...

In the Court's view, the criminality in relation to this matter is just below the mid range. The reason for that is that it appears that he was actually at the coal front in terms of supply rather than somewhere further up the line albeit that he may have been acting a little more independently than the average street dealer.

The other issue is that the levels of purity at 4.5 and 6.5 are at the bottom range. There was material which is suggestive of the fact that he was supporting himself by means of his drug sales when one considers that he was unemployed during the months leading up to his arrest and yet was incurring reasonably large rental costs but at the same time there does not appear to be any level of significant high living and unlike some cases large quantities of cash were not located, et cetera. So for those reasons the Court is of the view that the criminality falls just below the mid range.

Generally, in applying the standard non parole period, the Court has applied the principles set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way, R v Ohar and R v AP and Ors. (emphasis added)


23The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge's Remarks on Sentence demonstrated that he applied the approach to sentencing mandated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 contrary to what the High Court had said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.

24In that regard Senior Counsel for the Applicant drew attention to the highlighted passages in the ROS to submit that they demonstrated that the Sentencing Judge felt compelled to follow the dictates of Way as he was then required to do. In that way the need to relate the non-parole period to the SNPP offended the approach now directed by Muldrock.

25The Applicant further submitted that the assessment of objective seriousness made by the Sentencing Judge involved error because, contrary to Muldrock at [27] and [32], it took into account the Applicant's mental condition. 

26In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 I said (with the agreement of Whealy JA and Rothman J) at [26]:

...Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre-Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick. 

27As Bellew J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said in Trevor Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30]:

...when considering whether or not such an error has been established, it necessary to consider the reasons of the sentencing judge as a whole.

28In Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 McCallum J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) said:

[11] In Muldrock, the High Court held (at [25]) that Way was wrongly decided. Specifically, the court held that it was an error to characterise s 54B(2) as being framed in mandatory terms, requiring the court to take the standard non-parole period as the starting point for an offence assessed as being in the middle of the range. The court held that the correct approach was to identify all the factors relevant to sentence (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence given all those factors (at [26]). The court specifically rejected the two-staged approach of beginning with an assessment as to whether the offence fell within the middle of the hypothetical range and, if it did, turning to the inquiry as to matters that justify a longer or a shorter period (at [28]).

29I do not consider that the references to ""relativity"" in the ROS demonstrate any error by engaging in the two-stage approach disapproved by Muldrock. The reference is no more than an acknowledgement that the SNPP is one of the factors relevant. That is made clear by his Honour's reference to sentencing not being a mathematical exercise and that the final sentence must be arrived at intuitively. 

30Moreover, the sentence imposed for an offence said to be ""just below the mid-range"" had a notional starting point for the non-parole period of 8.33 years against a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Indeed, the notional starting point for the total sentence was 13 years. That is a strong indication not only that the SNPP was not the starting point for the sentencing exercise but also that undue weight was not given to it.

31The matter is not quite so clear when his Honour came to assess the objective seriousness of the offending. 

32After setting out the facts and making the comments set out in the first two paragraphs of the extract in [22] above, his Honour turned to discuss the Applicant's subjective features. In relation to the mental health issues his Honour said this:

The Court has had the benefit of a report from Dr Furst, psychiatrist, and while I do not propose to extract large portions of that into these remarks, I do note that the doctor reached the conclusion that the offender has a bipolar affective disorder and a substance abuse disorder. The substance abuse disorder relates more particularly to his use of various steroids.

The report also sets out what can be described as a reasonably problematic upbringing and it is clear that the combination of that upbringing and the mental illness has meant that Mr White has had many difficult periods in his life. It is noted that part of the disorder is that his moods will move up and down rather like a swell in the ocean and it is clear that there is some causal connection between his offending and his mental health issue, causal in the sense that the mental illness did not cause him to commit the offence but nevertheless the mental illness is such that it inhibited his judgment and it may well be that it contributed significantly to poor decisions that he made both in terms of his own use of substances and abuse of things like alcohol as well as his decision to become involved in the supply of illicit substances. The Court applies the principles set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases such as R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 and the subsequent case of R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314. (emphasis added)

33His Honour then noted other subjective matters and the issue of statistics of sentences before turning to assess the criminality of the offending. At that point he said:

In the Court's view, the criminality in relation to this matter is just below the mid range. The reason for that is that it appears that he was actually at the coal front in terms of supply rather than somewhere further up the line albeit that he may have been acting a little more independently than the average street dealer.

The other issue is that the levels of purity at 4.5 and 6.5 are at the bottom range. There was material which is suggestive of the fact that he was supporting himself by means of his drug sales when one considers that he was unemployed during the months leading up to his arrest and yet was incurring reasonably large rental costs but at the same time there does not appear to be any level of significant high living and unlike some cases large quantities of cash were not located, et cetera. So for those reasons the Court is of the view that the criminality falls just below the mid range.

34His Honour put forward two reasons for finding the criminality just below the mid-range. These two matters (the Applicant's position in the supply chain and the purity of the drug) are matters which go to the nature of the offending. Then, before concluding that the criminality falls just below the mid-range, his Honour appears to consider some matters personal to the Applicant although he does not refer to the mental health issues. 

35However, a closer analysis suggests that what follows the reference to the purity of the drug is an amplification of his reasons for finding that the Applicant was in the position of a street dealer. As his Honour noted elsewhere in the ROS (at 2):

It is to be noted that the purity level ranged between 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent which is street level purity level rather than a purity level one might expect to find somewhat further up the chain where purity levels can be and often are above fifty per cent.

36The other place in the ROS that the Sentencing Judge refers to the Applicant's mental health issues is when considering special circumstances. He there said (at 6):

I have applied many of the subjective factors to my assessment of the appropriate starting point with some residual application of the mental health issues to the decision to find the special circumstances and slightly change the ratio.

37Although in the passage set out at [32] above the Sentencing Judge makes a generalised reference to a causal link between the mental health issues and the offending, an assessment of the ROS as a whole does not suggest that the Applicant's mental health issues were considered by the Sentencing Judge as part of his assessment of criminality or objective seriousness. Certainly, when giving reasons for his assessment of the criminality his Honour did not refer at all to the mental health issues nor to issues concerning the cause of the Applicant's offending.

38I would reject this ground.

Ground 2 - objective seriousness

39The Applicant correctly acknowledged that the characterisation of the objective seriousness of a crime is a matter classically within the role of the Sentencing Judge and that this Court should be very slow to interfere with that characterisation. The Sentencing Judge exercises a broadly based discretion and the question must be whether or not the particular characterisation was open to his Honour: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [47]; R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [51]-[52].
40Three matters were put forward suggesting error on the part of the Sentencing Judge in characterising the objective seriousness as just below the mid-range. They were:

(1)the very low purity of the material;

(2) the gross weight was well towards the bottom of the range of a large commercial quantity;

(3) the absence of evidence to show that the offender was other than a street dealer.

41The Applicant, whilst acknowledging that the total weight of the substance found meant that the offence fell within the range of a large commercial quantity, pointed to the low level of purity which ranged between 4.5% and 6.5%. On that basis the pure form of the drug weighed a fraction under 195g, an amount less than the threshold for a supply of a commercial quantity. This, it was submitted, was a relevant matter for assessing the objective seriousness of the offending.

42I set out at [35] above what the Sentencing Judge said about the purity level. It is clear that the sentencing judge had regard to this matter. However, the total net weight of 3.3kg of the two quantities of sludge containing the drug, was more than three times the weight that constitutes a large commercial quantity. Further, the bulk value was agreed between $300,000 and $400,000 and, even though at that level of purity it could be suggested that those figures also represented street value, the Agreed Facts relevantly said:

An estimated bulk value of this amount of amphetamine is between $300,000 to $400,00. The street value of this amount of methylamphetamine is further increased on this monetary amount.

43The Applicant also pointed to the difficulty of characterising the offending as being in the mid-range when the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity has no upper limit. However, that submission falls into the error of according too much significance to the weight of the drug to the exclusion of other considerations: R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34; (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 at [33]; Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262 at [23]. 

44That there is no upper limit of the weight of a drug constituting a large commercial quantity has not been seen to be a problem in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending in other cases: Hamieh v R [2007] NSWCCA 277 at [22] - [23]; Ly at [28]; Efstathiadis v R [2009] NSWCCA 319 at [18]. 

45Whilst the purity level suggested the Applicant was a street dealer it was not true to say there was an absence of evidence suggesting that the Applicant was other than a street dealer. Three of the offences on the Form 1 were for possessing precursors of different types and one of the offences involved being in possession of drug manufacturing apparatus. Those matters might have suggested a greater involvement than being a mere street dealer. Nevertheless, the Sentencing Judge characterised the Applicant's role as a street dealer.

46It is necessary to demonstrate an error of the House v The King type to make out this ground. It cannot be said that his Honour's finding of the offence just being below the mid-range was not open to him. Nor was it an error for him to assess the offending in that way as the Applicant suggested: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [45] - [47].

47I would reject this ground.

Ground 3: Sentence manifestly excessive

48The Applicant's written submissions in relation to this ground of appeal concentrated in particular on the purity and weight of the drugs and, in the light of those matters, compared sentences in what were said to be comparable cases. The oral submissions concentrated on the diagnosis provided by Dr Furst and the Applicant's subjective features.

49In Hamieh the applicant was charged with supplying a little over 2kgs of methylamphetamine. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of seven years with an additional term of four years. When he was arrested at his home the police found numerous mobile phones and SIM cards, $9,625 in cash, electronic scales and an open box of Glucodin powder [it is not clear what this substance is - it may be an error for glucosin]. The potential street value of the drugs found was between $450,000 and $610,000. A co-offender was sentenced by another judge to a non-parole period of five years with an additional term of two years and nine months. A parity argument on behalf of the Applicant was upheld on appeal and he was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years and two months with an additional term of two years and nine months. 

50In Ly the applicant was charged with supplying 1101.22g of methylamphetamine. With a discount of 25% he was sentenced to a non-parole period of eight years with an additional term of four years. The notional starting point was, therefore, 16 years. The purity of the drug was 50.5% and the estimated street value was $550,000. At the time of his arrest he had a significant drug habit. The only appeal ground was that the Sentencing Judge erred by finding that his offence fell within the mid-range of seriousness for offences of the type. The appeal was dismissed. 

51In Efstathiadis v R [2009] NSWCCA 319 the applicant was charged with supplying 1.9kgs of methylamphetamine. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of ten years with an additional term of four years. The purity of the drug was 59.5%. He had previously been convicted in December 2000 for ongoing supply of a prohibited drug when two further matters were taken into account on the Form 1. His criminality was found by the Sentencing Judge to be only very slightly below the mid-range of seriousness. He received a 10% discount for his plea. The notional starting point, therefore, was 15 years and six months. He appealed on the basis that the sentence was manifestly excessive. This Court had regard to both Hamieh and Ly and held that they did not provide assistance in showing that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The appeal was dismissed.

52R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; (2012) 219 A Crim R 415 was a Crown appeal. The offender was charged with supplying 1.615kgs of methylamphetamine. He was given a total discount of 35% for his plea and further assistance and was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years and ten months with an additional term of one year and eight months. The notional starting point was, therefore, a little over 15.7 years. The Sentencing Judge concluded that the offender was a principal and was pivotal to the ongoing success of the syndicate. The street value was something over $450,000. There were parity issues that would have come into play had the sentence been increased by this Court. By majority the residual discretion was exercised to dismiss the appeal. 

53In Perdija v R [2012] NSWCCA 244 the Applicant was charged with supplying four counts of MDMA. The Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of three years and nine months. The sentences were structured so that the practical effect of the sentence for the fourth count was to increase the Applicant's non-parole period from four to six years and to add a year to the balance of his term. This Court held that there was no proper basis for that increase. The sentence for count 4 was reduced so that the overall sentence was a non-parole period of three and a half years with a balance of term of three and a half years. 

54These cases provide no support for a submission that the sentence in the present appeal was manifestly excessive. The notional starting point in the present case was 13 years. The sentence is well within the range of the sentences imposed in those cases (Perdija excepted) and although the weight of the drugs is not a determinative factor it is a matter to be taken into account. The weight in the present case exceeded the weight of the drugs in the other cases although the purity was lower. 

55Perdija is not an appropriate case to compare with the present. It concerned the supply of a commercial quantity of MDMA, the maximum sentence for which is 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of ten years. 

56I have also had regard to the other cases summarised by Adams J in Ehrlich which were said to be relevant to an assessment of the inadequacy of the sentence in that case. Amongst the cases that Adams J considered were Ly and Hamieh. 

57Senior Counsel for the Applicant submitted also that the offence was committed by a man whose life was 'quite chaotic"" having ""serious mental health problems"" that were closely connected to a long history of drug abuse. These subjective features were said to mean that the standard non-parole period had little significance in this case.

58The Applicant certainly had some favourable subjective features which the Sentencing Judge clearly considered and took into account. These included not only his mental health and substance abuse issues but also the fact that he had virtually no prior criminal history. I do not consider that his Honour failed to have regard to any relevant matters. I do not accept that because of these features the standard non-parole period had little significance. I do not consider that undue weight was given to it particularly having regard to the matters referred to in [30] above.

59The other matter that cannot be overlooked when considering whether the present sentence is manifestly excessive is the number and nature of the Form 1 charges that were taken into account. Not only did they not entitle the Applicant to leniency but they might be regarded as having appropriately increased the sentence on the principal offence: Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [43].

Conclusion

60As noted at [8] above the Sentencing Judge said that the sentence was to commence on 28 May 2010. That date does not accord with the dates his Honour gave as the expiry dates of both the non-parole period and the additional term. His Honour earlier noted that the Applicant had been in custody since 20 May 2010 and he proposed to backdate the sentence to that date. It seems likely, therefore, that the reference to commencing the sentence on 28 May was a typographical error in transcription of the judgment since neither counsel raised it with his Honour at the time. The sentence will, therefore commence on 20 May 2010 but will otherwise remain unchanged.

61I propose the following orders:

(1) Extend time to file Notice of Application for leave to appeal to 6 March 2013;

(2) Grant leave to appeal;

(3) Dismiss the appeal.

2762811,R v Deville [2013] NSWDC 317,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Of course the primary purpose of offences dealing with sexual offences committed against children is to protect children, both generally and individually. By definition children are young and vulnerable. They are capable of being exploited and sometimes they even need to be protected against themselves. Where an adult takes advantage of the vulnerability of a child to satisfy lustful urges, the resulting offences can only ever be described as serious. 

2The offender Rodney James Deville has pleaded guilty to three offences of having sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 10 but under the age of 14. For the first of those offences she was 12 years of age and for the third she was 13. The offences came about when Mr Deville moved in to the home where the complainant was living. From time to time Mr Deville's then girlfriend also lived there. A few weeks after he moved into the victim's home he asked her whether she wanted to go out with him. At this stage she was aged 11 and said yes. For a while the relationship was limited to hugging and kissing but matters progressed. The complainant began sleeping in the offender's bed when his girlfriend was not home. In late 2010 one night when the complainant was 12 and the offender was 18 they were in the offender's bed. The offender pulled the victim's pyjama pants down, inserted his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. She did not tell anyone what had happened.

3The following year the complainant was in her own bedroom in bed when the offender came in and got into bed with her. Once more he had sexual intercourse with the complainant. At this stage he was 21 years of age. It is apparent that as a result of what I have described the complainant became pregnant. Matters were confirmed after the third of the offences on which Mr Deville is to be sentenced. 

4Late in the evening of 19 May 2012 the complainant was feeling tired and experiencing stomach pains. She went to sleep in the offender's bed. During the night the offender pulled the complainant's pyjamas and underwear down and had sexual intercourse with her. She woke at 4 o'clock the next morning bleeding from her genital area. She woke her mother up and was taken to hospital by ambulance. When they got to hospital an ultrasound examination confirmed that she was pregnant and she was taken to a delivery suite. Matters did not progress well. An emergency Caesarean section was performed and she gave birth to a boy who was estimated to be 30 weeks gestation. I should make clear that, it is not suggested that Mr Deville's behaviour in having sexual intercourse with the complainant shortly beforehand caused the labour or any other injury to the complainant.

5Because of the child's age police were informed. At first the offender denied committing the offences but in May 2012 he broke down in tears and said to the complainant's mother that he had - as he put it - ""fucked up"". He admitted that he had committed the offences. He was then arrested. He declined to be interviewed but provided a DNA sample. Forensic analysis has confirmed that the offender is the father of the child born to the complainant in May 2012.

6What I have described is the offender taking advantage of the position he was placed in. He was invited into the complainant's home, and took advantage of the vulnerability of the complainant, while his girlfriend was absent, to have sexual intercourse with her. The form of sexual intercourse, penile/vaginal intercourse, is traditionally regarded as one of the more serious forms of intercourse, carrying with it of course a risk of disease and, as here, a risk of pregnancy. The offender's actions have caused a 13 year old to give birth to a child. It is difficult to describe that as something which is harmful. It is certainly a significant event in a 13 year old girl's life and while she may love the child, it is certainly a factor that I must take into account. Her life has been changed by the offender's behaviour and probably not for the better.

7The offender had a background which is easily described as dysfunctional. His parents were drug users and there were a large number of foster children in his home as well as natural siblings. The large number of foster children seems to have resulted, not necessarily from any great desire on the part of Mr Deville's parents to do good, but as a source of income. A psychological report tendered on behalf of the offender reveals that the offender's father worked collecting trolleys at a local supermarket, his mother assisted her husband with this business but did not otherwise work and it seemed that the family's main source of income was from fostering.

8The offender reported to the psychologist that his parents ostensibly left the children to their own devices with little in the way of supervision or support. This included assisting the children to meet their basic care needs. 

9Matters got worse when the offender's mother began a sexual relationship with one of the foster children. His parents separated and the offender now wishes to distance himself from his mother to a significant degree. One of Mr Deville's siblings has now served a custodial sentence as a result of his reaction to his mother's behaviour. Others of his siblings as well as his father have also served custodial sentences in the past.

10There are suggestions of the offender suffering brain damage as a young child but Mr Kerkyasharian who appears for Mr Deville today concedes that there is insufficient evidence for me to make a finding in that regard. But it is clear that whatever the cause, Mr Deville's time at school was a difficult one. He was bullied both at primary school and high school and has had learning difficulties. He did not complete his school certificate and has worked from time to time in particular with his father collecting trolleys. He has used drugs on occasion and indeed has a conviction for possessing drugs and introducing a drug into a detention centre. He received a community service order for that latter offence which has now been completed. He has also abused alcohol and explained some of his behaviour which has led to these offences by saying that it arose because he was intoxicated.

11As is common a psychologist subjected Mr Deville to some tests. There was a significant difference between his intellectual functioning as regards different aspects of those tests with his verbal skills being substantially lower than his non verbal skills. The psychologist summarises matters this way:

""I do not believe that any such deficit can explain Mr Deville's offending behaviour but would suggest that Mr Deville is someone who lacks insight and reflective capacity and whose reasoning and ability to understand concepts presented verbally as well as expressing himself within this domain would be compromised and superficial.""

12It is important to note that it is in verbal reasoning that Mr Deville's major deficits arise. There is nothing to suggest that he would not have been fully appreciative of the wrongfulness of his conduct in having sexual intercourse with a girl who was either 12 or 13 at the time. 

13Although he has expressed remorse, it is qualified. He does say to people that he feels like a low life for what he has done but it cannot be ignored that there are some suggestions of an effort to put some of the blame on the complainant, suggesting that she had a crush on him and noting that her mother allowed her, that is the complainant, to sleep in his bed.

14The maximum penalty for each of these offences is 16 years imprisonment which reflects the gravity with which the legislature says offences of this kind should be treated.

15The offender did not plead guilty at the first opportunity either. The charges to which he ultimately pleaded guilty were presented to him when he was first arraigned in this court. He pleaded not guilty to them and it was only on the day of the trial that those pleas of guilty were entered. There had been some indication a few days beforehand that that is what would happen. It cannot be suggested that the pleas of guilty came at the earliest opportunity but they nevertheless retained a significant utilitarian benefit. I will impose upon Mr Deville sentences which are approximately 20% less than they would otherwise have been to reflect the pleas of guilty and when they were entered.

16It cannot be ignored that the offender himself was relatively young. At law he was an adult but when a person turns 18 there is not some blinding flash of enlightenment which causes a person to mature overnight. The age of the offender may explain some of the findings made by the psychologist as regards the offender's behaviour and attitudes towards these offences but the offender clearly knew that what he was doing was wrong, both legally and morally. Having committed one offence he did not take steps to ensure that he did not commit a second and a third. He appears not to have regretted what he did but continued on acting as he had before.

17The offences are of such seriousness that in my opinion nothing less than a full time custodial sentence is required. As I began these remarks on sentence, it is important to protect children and it is important to protect the child in this case. Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a young girl of 12 or 13 years of age, for whatever reason, must know that significant and even harsh sentences will be imposed. This will be the offender's first time in custody. He believes that he is at risk more than others whilst in custody because of the occupation of the complainant's father. He will do his time in custody hard if only for that reason alone. That is another matter I take into account in determining the length of the appropriate sentences.

18I have decided to partially accumulate sentences as well. No person having committed one offence should feel that he or she can commit a second and a third offence without receiving extra punishment. Each of these offences caused harm to the complainant and so there needs to be a level of partial accumulation to reflect that circumstance. 

19There are clearly special circumstances in this case. I will reduce the non parole period at the expense of a period of eligibility for parole in order to ensure that upon release from custody the offender is supervised for a longer, than would ordinarily be the case, period of time. I do not do this as a favour to him. I do this in order to promote his rehabilitation, to minimise the risks of further offending of this kind.

20I sentence the offender as follows:

21On count 2 on the indictment I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to date from 25 November 2013. That is a fixed term because of sentences I will announce next.

22On count 4 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of 12 months to date from 25 May 2014 and a head sentence of two years.

23On count 6 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of six months to date from 25 November 2014 and a head sentence of two years. 

24Thus the overall sentence consists of a non parole period of 18 months and a head sentence of three years. The non parole period will expire on 24 May 2015 on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

2762813,R v Woodward [2013] NSWDC 264,"SENTENCE



1HIS HONOUR: Those of us who deal with the criminal law on a daily basis are regularly reminded about the devastation which is caused when drivers act dangerously and thereby cause injury and death. We are regularly reminded of the way in which people can be killed on the road, sometimes through momentary inattention, such as the matter I dealt with in this court last Friday, and sometimes through more extreme and ongoing illegal behaviour. I have an example of the latter category of offending present before me today.

2As Mr Healey, who appears for Tony Woodward, suggested, the way he was driving when he killed Sam Gunn was such that he was an accident waiting to happen. Those words are easy to say but it is worth analysing what they mean.

3What they mean is that the offender's driving was so dangerous that the risk of injuring or killing someone else on the road was very high indeed. That necessarily means that the offender's moral culpability was equally high.

4After drinking for a substantial period of time he got behind the wheel of his car. He was on a provisional licence, so his blood alcohol level should have been zero. That was the first road rule he ignored. Also in the car was Sam Gunn. He was a son, a brother, a father, a partner and a grandson.

5The offender drove in an incredibly dangerous manner while drunk. He came up behind another vehicle which was travelling at the speed limit, 90 kilometres an hour. Mr Woodward was apparently not willing to travel at the speed limit behind the vehicle in front of him. He overtook that vehicle by crossing unbroken lines, near the crest of a hill and given that that car was going 90 kilometres an hour, Mr Woodward's vehicle must have been going considerably faster.

6It will be seen now why Mr Healey's words accurately described the circumstances of his client's driving. The inevitable happened a moment later. The offender lost control of his car, it spun around and the passenger's side collided with a tree. Sam Gunn was killed.

7Victim impact statements were read by members of his family. They demonstrate how harm radiates out from the central tragic event of Sam Gunn's death. Devastation is everywhere, as family members try to carry on with their lives, having experienced an awful loss. I have considered the impact of this offence on others, consistent with the well known authorities which bind me.

8It is important that judges do what they can to stop other tragic events of this kind occurring. What we try and do is to impose upon people like Tony Woodward significant and even harsh sentences, not only to reflect the grave criminality that they have displayed but also to deter others who might be tempted to drink, cross unbroken lines near the crest of a hill and speed.

9What we want to do is deter others from acting as Mr Woodward has done. We do not want other families to suffer the way Sam Gunn's family has suffered.

10It is not only Mr Gunn's family who have suffered too. Mr Woodward has three children, he has a partner and they too will suffer because of his incarceration. But that is a necessary consequence of punishing 

11Mr Woodward as he must be punished. Hardship to others, such as offender's children and partners, is commonplace. The circumstances of this case are not exceptional at all.

12Mr Woodward expressed his remorse; of course he did not intend to kill Mr Gunn. He recognises belatedly the harm that he has caused Mr Gunn, his family and friends and his own family too. I say he recognised belatedly because had he stopped for a moment before overtaking that vehicle to think about what he was going to do he should have recognised that his conduct was not only dangerous but criminal in the extreme.

13I know little about Mr Woodward's background. I know that up until today he has been living with his girlfriend and their three children with whom he has a close and supportive relationship. He has worked in the past but has been in receipt of a disability support pension since 2005 and has been a heavy drinker at times.

14I have said this before when sentencing offenders in cases of this kind, that I do not really care how much a person drinks; what I do care about is when they drink a lot and then decide to drive in an intoxicated state.

15Guideline judgments concerning sentencing for this matter are well known. They are, as the name indicates, guides. I have taken them into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Mr Healey conceded, I understand, that there were no special circumstances in this case.

16The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four and a half years to date from today, 25 November 2013 and a head sentence of six years. The non-parole period will expire on 24 May 2018, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

17I disqualify Mr Woodward from driving for five years.

HIS HONOUR: Do you want me to dismiss the matters on the 166 certificate?

FATCHES: Withdraw them, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I note that they are withdrawn and they are also dismissed.

		04 February 2014",2013-11-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762816,Koh v R [2013] NSWCCA 287,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Keng Chuan Koh, applies for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the Sydney District Court on 10 June 2011. 

3The Applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s.25(2) and s.33 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""DMT Act""), for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years has been set. 

4The offence involved 2,272.612 kilograms of 3, 4 - Methylenedioxy-phenyl-2-propanone (""MDP2P""), a prohibited drug. The large commercial quantity for this prohibited drug is 500 grams. Accordingly, the Applicant's offence involved a quantity more than 4,000 times the large commercial quantity. 

5The Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 11 years and 10 months commencing on 18 December 2008 and expiring on 17 October 2020, with a balance of term of four years and eight months commencing on 18 October 2020 and expiring on 17 June 2025. 

The Present Application

6The Applicant did not file a Notice of Application for Extension of Time to Seek Leave to Appeal against sentence until 10 July 2013, some two years and one month after sentence had been passed. 

7The evidence adduced for the Applicant before this Court indicates that he had not sought previously to appeal against sentence, and that (according to the Applicant's affidavit sworn 21 September 2013) he ""was expecting a non-parole period of 15 years as that was the standard non-parole period"". 

8As part of a review process undertaken within Legal Aid NSW in light of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""), the Applicant received advice in May 2013 that he had reasonable prospects on an appeal, leading to the filing of the present application on 10 July 2013. 

9The Applicant seeks to rely upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a)Ground 1 - her Honour erred in the way the applicable standard non-parole period was taken into account;

(b)Ground 2 - it was not open to her Honour to assess the offence as ""slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness"";

(c)Ground 3 - the sentence is manifestly excessive.

10It is clear from the evidence that the trigger for this application is the decision of the High Court in Muldrock. Ground 1 asserts Muldrock error. The concept of Muldrock error was considered in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19]-[28]. 

11The only available explanation for an application long out of time, based upon Grounds 2 and 3, is that these grounds are themselves related in some way to the ground asserting Muldrock error.

12In Abdul v R at [42]-[53], the Court considered the principles to be applied where an extension of time is sought to appeal in a case such as this. This approach will be followed in determining the present application.

Sentence Imposed in Victoria for a Related Offence and Return to New South Wales

13The Applicant's offence in New South Wales was committed in December 2006. 

14The Applicant was arrested in Victoria on 18 December 2006, in circumstances to be described shortly in this judgment. 

15The Applicant pleaded guilty under Victorian law to a charge of trafficking a commercial quantity of a drug of dependence (385 kilograms of a precursor to producing MDMA). On 12 November 2007, he was sentenced in the Victorian County Court to imprisonment for a term of six years, with a non-parole period of four years commencing on 18 December 2006: R v Koh [2007] VCC 1484.

16A co-offender, Patrick Li (""Li"") was also sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Victoria, involving a term of six years and six months' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on 18 December 2006: R v Li [2008] VCC 901.

17On 12 November 2009, the Applicant and Li were transferred into the custody of the NSW Department of Corrective Services pursuant to s.15 Prisoners (Interstate Transfer) Act 1983 (Vic). 

18On 27 January 2010, the Applicant and Li were charged with offences in New South Wales. 

19The Applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Woodburne SC on 10 June 2011.

20On 10 August 2012, Li was sentenced by the same Judge for a similar offence to the Applicant. Li was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 years and three months commencing on 18 March 2009 and expiring on 17 June 2021, with a balance of term of seven years and three months commencing on 18 June 2021 and expiring on 17 September 2028.

21The Court was informed that Li has applied to this Court for leave to appeal against his sentence.

Facts of the Offence

22An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The Applicant did not give evidence at that hearing. 

23The Applicant (then aged 27 years) departed Malaysia by air on 10 December 2006 and arrived in Australia on 11 December 2006. He was a Singaporean national who had been residing in Malaysia. The Applicant came to Australia for the purpose of performing functions which gave rise to his liability for very serious crimes in New South Wales and Victoria. 

24Li (who was aged 50 years in 2006) was born in the Peoples Republic of China and migrated to Australia with his family in 1989.

Arrest of the Applicant and Li in Victoria

25Although events in Victoria occurred after the Applicant's arrival in Sydney and the commission of the New South Wales offence, it is appropriate to start with the arrest in Victoria. This event led the authorities to investigate the Applicant's movements and actions in New South Wales, which constituted the offence now before this Court.

26At around 5.10 pm on Monday, 18 December 2006, police observed Li and the Applicant near a white Toyota Hi Ace van bearing New South Wales registration plates, that was stopped near the intersection of Melbourne Road and Victoria Street, North Geelong. 

27A white Toyota Camry sedan, also with New South Wales registration plates, was parked a short distance away. As police approached, Li looked in their direction before walking away from the van back towards the Toyota Camry. Police approached the Applicant and had a brief conversation with him. During this time, Li was looking back towards the Applicant through his rear-vision mirror. Police then approached Li and he tried to drive away. Police asked him to stop the vehicle, which he did.

28Police then spoke to the Applicant and Li. Li told police that he had never seen the Applicant before and denied that he had been speaking with him moments earlier. Li told police that he had helped the Applicant push the van off the road as it had broken down. 

29A search of the van by police located 12 cardboard boxes in the rear. The boxes had Chinese symbols on their sides. When the van was opened, police could smell a strong chemical odour. Inside these boxes were 68 plastic containers, each of which contained about five litres of liquid. In response to an enquiry from police, the Applicant stated that the substance was ""massage oil"". 

30Also located in the rear of the van was a blue suitcase containing $2,700.00 in cash. In the glove box section of the van, police located an Avis rental agreement for the vehicle in the name of the Applicant. The van had been hired in Sydney on 16 December 2006 and was due to be returned on 21 December 2006. The Toyota Camry had been hired in Li's name on 17 December 2006 and was due to be returned on 20 December 2006.

31The liquid found in the containers in the van was later analysed and found to be 385 kilograms of MDP2P, the principal precursor to the manufacture of MDMA. There is no legitimate household or industrial use for MDP2P. 

32The Applicant and Li were arrested and taken into custody by Victorian police. 

33The Applicant and Li participated in recorded interviews with police. The Applicant stated (in a clearly false account), amongst other things, that he had come to Australia for a holiday, that he did not know Li (who helped him as the vehicle had broken down), that he had met a person called ""Assan"" at Ashfield who asked whether he was interested in delivering something to Geelong and that the $2,700.00 cash found in the suitcase belonged to him.

34The facts set out above constitute the offence for which the Applicant was sentenced in the Victorian County Court on 12 November 2007. The circumstances of that offence are related to the New South Wales offence now before this Court. 

Police Search Li's Residence At Padstow

35Following the arrest in Victoria of the Applicant and Li, New South Wales Police searched (under warrant) Li's residential premises at Padstow, on 19 December 2006. Li's wife and children were present at the time of the search.

36The address was part of a townhouse complex with an attached garage. The garage was divided into two separate sections by a false plasterboard wall. As the garage door was opening, police noticed a strong chemical smell. The smell was consistent with Safrole, or an analogous chemical. Safrole and its analogous chemical derivatives are precursors used in the manufacture of amphetamine-type substances, including 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA or Ecstasy).

Police Locate Drugs at Castle Hill

37Police received information about a factory unit (Unit E15) at a complex at 2A Victoria Avenue, Castle Hill. On the evening of Wednesday, 3 January 2007, police searched (under warrant) Unit E15. That unit was 9.1 metres wide and 12 metres deep.

38Once inside the unit (after opening various locks), police immediately detected a strong pungent odour. Inside the premises were 35 large cardboard boxes and 35 plastic tubs. The boxes each contained six plastic containers, with around five litres of liquid inside each container. In total, there were 175 containers in the boxes. A total of 386 plastic containers, of five-litre capacity containing liquid, were located in Unit E15.

39The liquid from the containers was analysed and found to contain 2,272.612 kilograms of 100% pure MDP2P. A forensic chemist estimated that the total amount of MDMA that could have been made, from this amount of MDP2P, was about 2,454 kilograms of pure MDMA powder. The total street value of that amount of MDMA was estimated, conservatively, at approximately $500 million. 

40The cardboard boxes found within Unit E15 had the same Chinese character markings on their exterior as the cardboard boxes that were found in the rear of the van driven by the Applicant in Victoria. The plastic five-litre containers were also the same, with identical exterior markings and characters. 

Some Actions of the Applicant in New South Wales

41The Agreed Statement of Facts revealed that the Applicant took a number of steps following his arrival in Australia on 11 December 2006. 

42The Applicant met Li soon after his arrival in Australia. 

43At around 2.26 pm on 11 December 2006, the Applicant and Li went to the office of the Department of Fair Trading at Hurstville. Their movements were captured on CCTV between 2.26 pm and 2.55 pm. The Applicant and Li jointly entered certain details on a business registration form and registered the business name ""Glory Trading Company"". Li obtained the registration form and both men sat together. The Applicant completed the details on the form, with Li watching closely and apparently assisting him. 

44At about 2.53 pm, both men went to the service counter, where they were served by a staff member and registration of the business name was effected on computer. Li paid the sum of $137.00 for the registration. 

45The business name ""Glory Trading Company"" was registered in the name of the Applicant. The address given as the business address, 233 Canterbury Road, Canterbury, had no connection to the Applicant or Li.

46The Applicant provided a personal address of 68 Liverpool Road, Ashfield. This address had no connection with the Applicant or Li, although it was a short distance from the Ashfield Motor Inn at 63 Liverpool Road Ashfield, where the Applicant was staying.

47The business name registration form was signed by the Applicant, with his position being described as ""Director"".

48The Applicant checked into the Ashfield Motor Inn on 11 December 2006. He gave the name ""Alvin Koh Keng Chuan"" and provided a Singapore address. The Applicant paid $595.00 cash. He stayed at the Ashfield Motor Inn up to and including the night of 17 December 2006, checking out on 18 December 2006, before the commencement of the journey to Victoria. 

49On 12 December 2006, the Applicant and Li attended the factory unit complex at 2A Victoria Avenue, Castle Hill. Those premises comprised 85 units, which were rented from month to month with no bond. The complex was advertised at the time in local newspapers and in the ""Trading Post"" as being ""small factory units for rent, short or long term, monthly tenancy agreements, no bond and no lease"". 

50Upon arrival at the Castle Hill premises, the Applicant and Li met a Mr Hoyle, the property manager for the complex. The three men walked into Unit E15. According to Mr Hoyle, Li did all the talking and asked about the cost, before agreeing to lease the unit. Li paid Mr Hoyle $2,100.00 in cash, and said that he wanted the key to Unit E15 on 15 December 2006.

51On 15 December 2006, Mr Hoyle received a telephone call from Li and the two men met at Unit E15. The Applicant was not present on this occasion. Mr Hoyle explained to Li the process for locking and unlocking Unit E15 and he provided Li with a key for the slide-bolt lock. Mr Hoyle asked Li for a name and number and Li handed him a piece of paper that said ""James KOH, Glory Trading"", which contained a mobile phone number. The phone number was the same as that inserted in the business name registration application lodged on 11 December 2006 for ""Glory Trading Company"".

52The key to Unit E15 handed to Li on 15 December 2006, was the only key to that unit. 

53At around 9.00 am on 16 December 2006, the Toyota Hi Ace van (used for the Victorian run) was rented from the Ashfield office of Avis car rentals. This location was a short distance from the Ashfield Motor Inn, where the Applicant had been residing. The vehicle was rented in the Applicant's name. The van was due to be returned to the same office on 21 December 2006. 

54At about 6.15 pm on 17 December 2006, the Toyota Camry (also used for the Victorian run) was rented from the Sydney Airport office of Avis car rentals. The vehicle was rented in Li's name. The vehicle was due to be returned to the same office on 20 December 2006. 

A Container Arrives at Unit E15

55Police canvassed persons in the area surrounding the Castle Hill factory unit complex, with a view to obtaining evidence concerning the movement of material in and out of Unit E15. Information received from a number of persons did not permit precise times to be identified for a number of observed movements. 

56However, it seems clear that what was observed by these persons occurred in the days after the key to Unit E15 was provided to Li on 15 December 2006.

57A Mr Matchett worked at a factory unit opposite Unit E15. He saw a red shipping container arrive ""around the second last week that we finished up for the Christmas break"" (a date around 18 December 2006). Mr Matchett observed some tape or rope around poles outside Unit E15 and, at a later time, a red shipping container with three Asian males unloading cardboard boxes from it. Mr Matchett could not identify from photographs either the Applicant or Li as being any of these three men.

58A Mr Davies was the manager of a business in the Castle Hill complex. He observed a shipping container and two Asian males (and possibly three others) unloading the container. He did not pay much attention to these males and could not say how old they were.

59A Mr Hanley attended the Castle Hill complex at different times in December 2006. He recalled at one point seeing an area marked out with a sign ""No Parking Shipping Container Due Soon"", with a shipping container thereafter appearing at the location. 

60A Mr Vergara attended the Castle Hill complex in December 2006. During one of those visits, he noticed a sign requesting no parking as a shipping container was to arrive. On another occasion, he saw a large red shipping container arrive and he watched it being unloaded. He saw an Asian male talking on a mobile telephone. The boxes were being taken from the container into Unit E15. Later, Mr Vergara saw two Asian males arrive and they started to empty the container using a trolley. They were stacking the boxes in Unit E15. Later the same day, he noticed that Unit E15 was closed and, a few days later, he noticed that the container was no longer there. 

61Police conducted identification procedures with all witnesses who made observations at the Castle Hill complex, but none were able to identify the Applicant or Li as being persons observed at the premises. 

Investigations of Telephone Usage

62Investigations were undertaken with respect to the mobile telephone located on the Applicant upon his arrest in Victoria on 18 December 2006. Call charge records revealed:

(a)the service was active in the early afternoon of 17 December 2006, and could be tracked intermittently running through various locations close to the Castle Hill factory unit complex;

(b)at about 9.11 pm on 17 December 2006, the service was at Picnic Point (a short distance from Li's home at Padstow);

(c)between 5.48 am and 5.19 pm on Monday, 18 December 2006, the service was active and was moving south from Sydney to Geelong in Victoria.

Further Investigations After Arrest of Applicant and Li on 18 December 2006

63On 18 December 2006, the Applicant and Li drove from Sydney to Geelong, Victoria in the Avis rented Toyota Hi Ace van and Toyota Camry. The two men were captured together on CCTV at service stations in Albury and Euroa in the course of this journey.

64Upon the arrest of the Applicant and Li in Victoria on 18 December 2006, a key was located in the Toyota Camry, with that key being the key to the padlock that secured the roller door of Unit E15. 

65The quantity of 385 kilograms of MDP2P located in the Toyota Hi Ace van was a sample taken from the larger quantity of prohibited drug stored in Unit E15.

66Interviews were sought to be conducted with the Applicant and Li in October 2007 concerning the New South Wales offences. During his interview, the Applicant refused to comment in relation to his connection with Li and in relation to the MDP2P. Li listened to the allegations, but refused to comment. 

67Following the transfer of both the Applicant and Li from Victoria to New South Wales in November 2009, both men were charged with the New South Wales matters.


Applicant's Interview with Police on 27 January 2010

68On 27 January 2010, the Applicant participated in a recorded interview with police. In the course of this interview, the Applicant said, amongst other things:

(a)he registered a business, hired a van and drove to Victoria;

(b)he did all of this on the instructions of a male in Malaysia and Li;

(c)one phone was given to him in Malaysia and another by Li;

(d)he went to Unit E15 once only;

(e)he was asked to come to Australia by a man in Malaysia to be a driver, and he did not know the details of what this would involve;

(f)he came with $3,000.00-$4,000.00 that he was given by his mother-in-law;

(g)Li asked him to register the business name, and gave him a piece of paper with the details on it that he transferred on to the form;

(h)if he knew his role was to drive drugs, he still would have agreed, but he did not know this;

(i)he needed money for his wife, who was sick with ovarian cancer;

(j)Unit E15 was rented in his name and was empty on 12 December 2006;

(k)he said he was ""only a worker"" who was ""only taking instructions from someone""';

(l)before he and Li left for Victoria, the drugs were already in the rear of the van;

(m)he never knew what the drugs in the back of the van looked like, but he smelt it and ""knew something was wrong, and a really serious matter"";

(n)he ""knew it wasn't massage oil"";

(o)the smell was a ""chemical smell"";

(p)Li gave him SIM cards which he used;

(q)he followed instructions from Li as he was driving.

Some General Admissions by the Applicant

69The Agreed Statement of Facts, which was signed by the Applicant, concluded in the following way (AB57-58):

""It is agreed that LI and KOH knowingly took part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of MDP2P by organising and providing the factory unit E15 knowing that those premises would be used to store MDP2P and in contemplation that the MDP2P would be supplied by someone in the syndicate.

The Crown concedes that it can not prove beyond reasonable doubt that LI or KOH knew the precise quantity of MDP2P that would be stored at E15, however it is agreed that they both knew that it was to be a substantial and significant quantity, well in excess of the large commercial quantity prescribed for that drug. It is agreed that they both knew the size of E15 and that it would only be used by the syndicate to store the MDP2P. They both knew that large premises were required because the quantity of drug to be stored there was substantial and bulky. LI and KOH have both entered pleas and been convicted in relation to trafficking 385kg of MDP2P in Victoria. It is agreed that the drug in Victoria was a sample taken from the larger quantity at E15.

The Crown concedes that it can not prove beyond reasonable doubt that LI and KOH were the only participants to this criminal enterprise and that the drug in E15 could have been accessible to others"".

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

70The Applicant's subjective case on sentence was to be found in an affidavit of the Applicant sworn 21 April 2011 (which addressed his custodial experiences and their consequences only), a letter dated 16 April 2011 from the Applicant's younger brother and a report of Mr Mark Howard, psychologist, dated 11 March 2011. 

71The Applicant did not give oral evidence at the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, the Applicant gave no sworn account of his role in the enterprise at both the Malaysian and Australian ends of the operation. 

72The sentencing Judge noted that the Applicant was 27 years of age at the time of the offence and 31 years of age at the time of sentence. He is now 33 years of age.

73Based on the material tendered on sentence, her Honour accepted the personal history contained in the psychological report. The Applicant had worked as a car salesman and debt collector. He has a record of previous convictions in Singapore as a child and young man, with these offences said to be attributable to early association with local gang members engaged in conflict with opposing groups.

74The Applicant had discontinued his education at the age of 12 and he then worked in a coffee shop run by his grandparents.

75The Applicant had married in 2005. The Applicant and his wife moved from Singapore to Malaysia in late 2005 after (according to the Applicant), a warrant had issued for his arrest in Singapore after he assaulted a man who had allegedly sexually assaulted or harassed his wife. 

76The Applicant had no history of drug or alcohol abuse and, whilst he did gamble on occasions in Singapore, he denied any history of compulsive gambling.

77The Applicant's wife was said to have filed for divorce in 2009 following his imprisonment in Australia, and he had no further contact with her. The Applicant's remaining family (his father and two brothers) live in Singapore and he had not seen them since his arrest in December 2006. The Applicant has telephone contact, from time to time, with his family.

78The evidence before the sentencing Judge indicated that the Applicant had held a number of jobs in custody in Victoria and New South Wales, in which he demonstrated a good work ethic. The Applicant had participated in courses and obtained TAFE certificates in asset maintenance, cleaning operations and in hospitality.

79The sentencing Judge accepted the Applicant's expression of remorse. 

80Her Honour observed that the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded, with those prospects being linked to opportunities to obtain employment upon release.

81A discount ""in the order of 25%"" was allowed for the Applicant's plea of guilty. Apart from the utilitarian value of the early plea, the sentencing Judge accepted that it constituted evidence of contrition (ROS37).

Findings of the Sentencing Judge Concerning the Objective Seriousness of the Offence and the Relevance of the Standard Non-Parole Period

82Each of the grounds of appeal raise, in one way or another, findings made by the sentencing Judge concerning the objective seriousness of the offence. It is appropriate to set out a number of these findings, before moving to consider the challenges made to the sentence.

83Her Honour observed that, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, ""one material factor but by no means the determinative factor"" was the quantity of drug involved (ROS25). Located inside Unit E15 was 2,272.612 kilograms of 100% pure MDP2P, a quantity which her Honour observed ""can only be described as staggering"" (ROS25). The amount involved was more than 4,000 times the large commercial quantity of 500 grams. 

84The sentencing Judge noted with respect to the quantity, potential profit and likely harm involved (ROS26):

""A forensic chemist has estimated that the total amount of MDMA that could be made from this amount of MDP2P is about 2454 kilograms of pure MDMA powder. The total street value of that amount of MDMA is conservatively estimated at approximately $500 million. The extent of the legal profit potentially involved was enormous. The potential harm to the community by the distribution of MDMA had it been manufactured would have been correspondingly significant. It is fortunate that police recovered the drug before that could happen.

A matter to be taken into account is the fact that the Crown has conceded that it cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew the precise quantity of MDP2P that would be stored in E15. However it has to be recognised that the purpose of renting the premises of the size of E15 was to accommodate a substantial and bulky quantity of drugs.""

85Her Honour noted the competing submissions concerning the role of the Applicant (ROS26-27):

""A significant factor in the determination of the objective seriousness of the matter is the role of the offender and his level of participation in the offence. On behalf of the Crown it has been contended that the offender could not be described as a mere 'warehouser' of the drugs and that although he was by no means on the available evidence to be regarded as at or near the top of the hierarchy in this syndicate run organisation he was further up than a mere warehouser. On behalf of the offender it is submitted that the offender was at the lowest level of the drug hierarchy, indeed the offender was not even a warehouser of drugs because it was Li and not the offender who retained the key, and there is no proof that Koh went back to the premises after they were rented from Mr Hoyle.""

86Submissions were made by the Crown and the Applicant in the District Court concerning the relevance and use of the Victorian sentence imposed on 12 November 2007. It was common ground that the Victorian and New South Wales offences were overlapping, so that a degree of concurrency was appropriate with regard to be had, as well, to totality. 

87The sentencing Judge assessed the role and participation of the Applicant in the offence in the following way (ROS28-30):

""It seems to me that in assessing the role of the offender and his level of participation in the offence it is necessary to pay close attention as to what it can be proved the offender actually did. In that regard the evidence establishes the following:

· The offender arrived in Australia on 11 December 2006. That afternoon he and Li went to the Department of Fair Trading at Hurstville where Koh, with Li assisting, filled out a business registration form in the name of Glory Trading Company. The application was made in Koh's name and signed by him as Director of the Glory Trading Company. Incorrect addresses were supplied. A mobile number was supplied. A phone utilising that number was located in the Camry in which Li had driven to Victoria. It was Li and not Koh who paid the $137.00 registration fee. It can be inferred that the purpose of the registration of the business name was to feign legitimacy to the lessor of the factory premises which were intended to be used to store the prohibited drugs.

· On 12 December 2006 the offender Koh, together with Li, organised and provided the factory unit in which the drugs were subsequently stored. In that regard it was Li who rang Mr Hoyle and inquired about the size and costs of the factory units. Shortly after the offender and Li attended the factory unit of E15 where Li spoke with Mr Hoyle about rental of the 9.1 metre wide and 12 metre deep factory unit. It was Mr Li who paid Mr Hoyle $2100 in cash for the rental. The key for the unit was collected by Li on 15 December 2006 when Li handed over to Mr Hoyle a piece of paper containing the business name Glory Trading Company, the name James Koh and the mobile number which was the same number that had been placed on the business registration form and which was used by a phone found in the Camry in which Li was driving on 18 December 2006. There is no evidence that Koh was present on the occasion of the 15th.

· It appears that the red shipping container containing the drugs was delivered after the 15 December with one witness placing the delivery on or about the 18 December 2006, that is the day that Koh and Li travelled to Victoria. Although a number of Asian males were seen unloading the boxes from the container and standing near a van there is no evidence identifying Koh as one of those men. There is no evidence then that Koh attended the factory unit after he participated in organising the rental of it on 12 December 2006.

It is apparent from that statement of what the offender did that his was an integral part in the registration of the business name and the organising and providing of the premises. As the agreed facts state he participated knowing that those premises would be used to store MDP2P and in contemplation that the MDP2P would be supplied by someone in the syndicate. The participation in the subject offence was limited to a period extending over a matter of days. It is apparent from the description of the events that Li played a superior role to that of Koh for it appears to have been with his assistance and at his direction that the business registration form was filled out. It was Li who paid for that registration, it was Li who spoke to Mr Hoyle and it was Li who went back to the storage premises to obtain the key for the unit. It was Li who provided Mr Koh's name to Mr Hoyle.""

88The sentencing Judge recorded the Applicant's account concerning his participation in the offence, including the statement that there was a need to finance the treatment of his wife's progressive ovarian cancer. 

89Her Honour referred to an aspect of Mr Howard's report, and then continued with respect to the Applicant's account (ROS31-32):

""Accepting Mr Howard's assessment as to Mr Koh's deficits in abstract problem solving and reasoning that are often associated with below average intelligence, there are some difficulties in assessing the veracity of the account given by the offender concerning his involvement in the offence.

The offender did not provide sworn evidence about his participation. He was not, however, required for cross-examination on his affidavit, although that affidavit did not address those matters which are contained in the record of Mr Howard, which were said to have led to his involvement in the offence. No concrete details of the circumstances leading to the offender's involvement have been placed before me. The offender's brother provided a general reference, again not addressing any particular matter said to relate to the offender's involvement such as to the offender's wife's ovarian cancer.""

90The sentencing Judge referred to differing accounts provided, at different times, by the Applicant with respect to the amount of money he was to make from the enterprise. The figure given by the Applicant varied from $2,000.00 to $5,000.00, as well as various sums in between those two figures. Having noted the unsatisfactory nature of this aspect, her Honour proceeded to find that the Applicant's motive was clearly a financial one (ROS32-33):

""It is clear however that the offender's motive was a financial one. He was not himself a drug user. It is apparent from the whole of the circumstances that this was a large commercial enterprise involving an enormous amount of drugs, and enormous potential profit. That said, the objectively established facts are silent about the offender's participation above and beyond that of his role set out above. There is no evidence, for example, that he was an entrepreneur who conceived of the enterprise, or that he was to share in the profits of the sale of the precursor, or the sale of any drugs that may have been produced from that precursor.""

91The sentencing Judge was prepared to accept, as his Honour Judge Kelly had in the Victorian County Court, that the Applicant ""was a person who by reason of events in his life, and by reason of his lack of education and intelligence, was vulnerable to being used in the criminal undertaking of others"" (ROS33). 

92Her Honour found that the Applicant ""was a subordinate of Li"" and that the Applicant ""acted at the direction of Li"" (ROS34). Her Honour accepted that the Victorian offence confirmed that the Applicant's ""participation and role was that of a person at the lower end of the hierarchy of this major criminal enterprise, even though little is known of the structure of that enterprise, and of its participants, including as to the man in Malaysia"" (ROS34). 

93Her Honour then stated, in a paragraph which the Applicant emphasised before this Court (ROS34):

""Taking into account the matters I have set out, particularly the material matter of the enormous quantity of drugs involved, the role and participation of the offender in what was clearly a large commercial enterprise, and those circumstances directly relating to the commission of the offence, I have determined that the offence committed by the offender Koh is one which falls slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of knowingly take part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs.""

94The sentencing Judge observed that, in the determination of an appropriate sentence, it was necessary to have regard not just to the objective facts surrounding the commission of the offence, but also the personal circumstances of the Applicant, to which her Honour then turned (ROS34-38). Her Honour found special circumstances in the need for an adjustment of the non-parole period in order to accommodate the partial accumulation of the sentence upon that imposed in Victoria, and hardship arising from the Applicant's imprisonment in Australia (ROS38). 

95Immediately before announcing and imposing the sentence, her Honour said (in paragraphs relied upon by the Applicant in this Court) (ROS39):

""The non parole period which I intend to impose is, I consider, the minimum period of imprisonment that justice requires the offender to serve having regard to all of the circumstances. The effective overall ratio is that which is specifically intended by me. I intend to backdate the commencement of the sentence to allow for that partial accumulation.

As mentioned previously, the standard non parole period in the present circumstances takes its place as a guidepost or reference point, along with other matters such as the maximum penalty. The non parole period which I intend to impose is less than the standard non parole period for a s 25(2) DMTA offence by reason of: the circumstance that the offence is, having regard to those matters I mentioned above, one which is slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness; there was a plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity; there is contrition, and there is remorse; there is accumulation of sentence.""

Should an Extension of Time be Granted in this Case?

96Extensive reference has been made to the facts of the offence, the Applicant's subjective circumstances and the remarks on sentence.

97Given the nature of the application to extend time, it is appropriate to move to the grounds of appeal in a summary fashion: Abdul v R at [53]. Substantial written submissions were placed before the Court, supplemented by oral submissions at the hearing of the application. It is not necessary to recite the submissions in any detail in this judgment.

Submissions of the Parties

98Ms Rigg, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that Muldrock error had occurred in this case. It was not submitted that express error had occurred in the formula of words used by the sentencing Judge. Rather, it was submitted that an examination of the sentence imposed, in the circumstances of the case, ought lead to a conclusion that the standard non-parole period had played a prescriptive or determinative role on sentence. It was submitted that the Court should conclude that it was highly likely that her Honour had utilised the standard non-parole period as a ""springboard"" from which she delved into the task of balancing the other factors identified: Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50 at [35]. 

99In support of Ground 2, it was submitted for the Applicant that, by reference to what the Applicant actually did, a finding of objective seriousness slightly above the mid-range was unsustainable. It was submitted that, despite the enormity of the quantity involved, the Applicant's involvement did not warrant that finding. 

100In support of Ground 3, it was submitted that a correct assessment of relevant objective and subjective factors, paying appropriate regard to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as guideposts, would lead the Court to conclude that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was plainly unjust.

101The Crown submitted that Muldrock error had not been demonstrated in this case, and that there was no merit in any of the proposed grounds of appeal so that the application for an extension of time should be refused. The Crown pointed to the massive quantity of prohibited drug involved in the offence and such evidence identifying the actions taken by the Applicant, leading to the imposition of a sentence which was clearly open to the sentencing Judge. 

Determination

102I am not persuaded that Muldrock error has been demonstrated in this case. The Applicant does not contend that there is patent Muldrock error by reference to the words used by the sentencing Judge in her remarks on sentence. The approach of the sentencing Judge to the standard non-parole period involved permissible use of it as a guidepost on sentence, in a manner consistent with the decision in Muldrock.

103The Applicant's submission, in effect, is that latent Muldrock error has occurred. I do not accept this submission. As will be explained further in considering Grounds 2 and 3, the explanation for the substantial sentence imposed upon the Applicant may be found in the enormous quantity of prohibited drug involved, and the Applicant's significant role as a person imported from Malaysia to carry out what were clearly seen to be important tasks.

104In George v R [2013] NSWCCA 263, Latham J observed at [50] (with my agreement at [49]) that the detection of Muldrock error is not assisted by calling in aid metaphors such as ""springboard"". What is necessary is an examination of the substance of what occurred. In this case, an assessment of the magnitude of the Applicant's offence is such that the Court should reject the submission that the standard non-parole period had a prescriptive or determinative role in this case, so as to give rise to Muldrock error.

105Grounds 2 and 3 may be considered together. 

106The maximum penalty and standard non-parole period for an offence are not mere formalities, but represent important yardsticks or guideposts created by the legislature for sentencing courts: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 372 [30]-[31]; Muldrock at 132 [27], 133 [31]; Magaming v The Queen [2013] HCA 40; 87 ALJR 1060 at 1070 [48]. 

107The DMT Act involves a quantity-based regime, with maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods escalating as the amount of the relevant drug crosses from one quantity-based category into another: Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; 219 A Crim R 104 at 122 [132]. 

108There is no upper limit beyond the large commercial quantity. That category may be engaged where the quantity just exceeds the limit, or where the offence escalates to involve quantities confined only by the limits upon the capacity of a criminal syndicate to organise drugs for supply for potentially massive profits. The extent to which the quantity exceeds the threshold for the large commercial quantity is a very material consideration in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence: Paxton v R at 122 [131]-[132]; R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40; 221 A Crim R 505 at 507 [6], 522-523 [69].

109With respect to Commonwealth drug importation offences, it has been said that the statements by the High Court of Australia in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 do not suggest that, in an appropriate case, the amount of the drug involved in an importation is not a highly relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence, even to the extent of assessing that a particular offence is in the worst category of its type. In many cases, the only factor that would lead to a determination that one importation is worse than another would be the amount of drug involved, where otherwise the circumstances of the importation were the same or very similar: R v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at 127 [72](d) and (e); Nguyen v R; Phommalysack v R [2011] VSCA 32; 31 VR 673 at 676 [2], 681-683 [33]-[34]. The enormous quantity of prohibited drug involved in this case attracts a similar approach.

110In the present case, the undisputed fact was that the quantity of the relevant prohibited drug was more than 4,000 times the threshold for the large commercial quantity, rightly described by the sentencing Judge as ""staggering"". Further, the undisputed fact was that that quantity of MDP2P could have been used to produce 2,454 kilograms of pure MDMA powder, with a conservative street value of $500 million.

111These undisputed facts provide a necessary context for an assessment of the gravity of the crime committed by the Applicant, and an assessment of the role which he performed in that respect. 

112Although the Agreed Statement of Facts pointed to an imprecise knowledge on the part of the Applicant of the actual quantity involved, he was aware that a large factory unit was required to store the prohibited drug. He knew that a very large quantity was involved. The Applicant also knew that the truckload of drugs which he drove to Victoria on 18 December 2006 was a sample taken from Unit E15. The Applicant was also aware that those involved in this criminal enterprise had gone to the trouble of bringing him from Malaysia to Australia, to carry out certain functions associated with the enterprise. Accordingly, the Applicant had a significant appreciation of the scale of the enterprise.

113The sentencing Judge was entitled to be very cautious in approaching the Applicant's account as to how he became involved in the enterprise. The Applicant did not give evidence concerning his role in the offence. As the sentencing Judge noted, there were fluctuations in the Applicant's account, in particular with respect to the amount of money which he was to receive for services rendered. 

114Further, there was no corroboration at all for the Applicant's claim that he was motivated because of a financial need to assist his wife, who suffered from ovarian cancer. The letter from the Applicant's brother tendered on sentence did not assert that this was the case.

115The Applicant pleaded guilty to the offence, thereby admitting the elements of the crime. In addition, there was an Agreed Statement of Facts placed before the sentencing Judge. Beyond that, there was the account given by the Applicant to police on different occasions, or to the psychologist who prepared a report for the sentencing proceedings. This material was to be viewed with considerable caution, given the absence of sworn evidence from the Applicant concerning these matters: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 [58]-[59], 380 [79]; R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425 at [4].

116The Applicant's first account to police in Victoria in December 2006 was false, including a claim that he was in Australia on holiday and did not know Li. When interviewed in October 2007, the Applicant refused to comment in relation to Li and the MDP2P. His interview in January 2010 occurred against this background of earlier deception and non-disclosure. This alone called for a most guarded approach to the Applicant's unsworn, untested and uncorroborated account.

117The subject matter of the sentencing proceedings was such that the statements of the High Court of Australia in The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 and Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 were highly pertinent. 

118The Applicant's involvement in the offence ""had its genesis outside this country"" so that it may not be possible to say, with any certainty, what exactly was done or intended by the Applicant as a person apprehended in Australia, having come to this country for the purpose of involvement in the crime: The Queen v Olbrich at 278 [16]. 

119In the absence of a sworn and complete account by the Applicant concerning his actions, the persons involved overseas and in Australia associated with the relevant activities, and the nature and quantum of the reward to be obtained for his involvement in the crime, a sentencing court may not be in a position to make findings and, in particular, findings of some lesser involvement on his part, as to which he bears the onus of proof to the civil standard: The Queen v Olbrich at 279-281 [20]-[27]. 

120An assessment of the Applicant's role was not to be determined by the selection of a label which might (or might not) properly attach to him (such as ""warehouser"" - see [85] above). The criminality involved is to be assessed by consideration of the involvement of the Applicant and the steps taken by him to commit the offence. The sentencing Judge in this case was entitled to approach the matter upon the basis that the full nature and extent of the criminal enterprise involving the Applicant was not known to the Court, so that a precise characterisation of the Applicant's role was made more difficult: Paxton v R at 122-123 [135].

121Indeed, the concluding part of the Agreed Statement of Facts (at [69] above) bears this out. It is clear that the Applicant would be able to provide a detailed account of the enterprise if he saw fit to do so. Of course, there was no obligation to take this course. However, by not doing so, the Applicant confronted difficulties in discharging the civil onus of proof, in an effort to establish that he was a low-level functionary in the enterprise.

122In the result, her Honour made a number of generous findings concerning the Applicant (see [91]-[92] above). 

123It is necessary to keep in mind a number of features of the case, which gave rise to inferences that operated adversely to the Applicant on sentence.

124Firstly, the Applicant was imported specially from Malaysia to Australia to perform a number of tasks in a period from 11 December 2006. This was a critical period when the container was to be unloaded and the process of distribution commenced, starting with the Victorian run. This is not a case of a person selected to convey a prohibited drug into Australia, as a so-called courier or ""mule"". The appropriate inference was that the Applicant was selected by another person or others involved in the criminal syndicate at the Malaysian end to perform important functions in Australia, and then return to Malaysia. Such a role would usually be fulfilled by a trusted individual, able to carry out these functions in a reliable way. 

125It would be, to say the least, unusual for a person to be selected to travel to Australia to carry out basic functional tasks only inside Australia. 

126It may be observed, as well, that the Applicant apparently did not take part in the functional role of unloading the contents of the container into Unit E15. Further, there seemed to be several persons involved in that process whom, it might be thought, could have driven the van from Sydney to Victoria. It was not necessary to import the Applicant from Malaysia to perform this basic transport role. These matters point to the Applicant's role as being more substantial than that contended for by his counsel at first instance, and in this Court.

127Secondly, immediately upon arrival in Australia, the Applicant worked with Li, in a number of ways, to register a business name, play a part in the retention of Unit E15 to hold the very large quantity of drugs and then, once again in conjunction with Li, to physically convey a shipment of the prohibited drug into Victoria. 

128The Applicant may be characterised as a vital participant, fulfilling multifaceted functions, in the seven-day period before he and Li were arrested on 18 December 2006. 

129Thirdly, it is true that the Applicant's name was used for certain purposes in connection with these activities. However, it was expected that the Applicant would be in Australia for a limited time only, before returning overseas. It was not intended (and the Applicant did not expect) that he would remain in Australia for any length of time. 

130Fourthly, the Avis rental vehicles, rented by the Applicant and Li, were to be returned to Sydney on 20 or 21 December 2006. The appropriate inference was that, after delivering the substantial quantity of the prohibited drug to its destination in Victoria, the two men would return to Sydney where the contents of Unit E15 remained for distribution.

131The New South Wales offence involved a massive quantity of prohibited drug, with the potential to cause a very great deal of harm both individually and socially: R v Calcutt at 524 [73]. This quantity would have entered the drug market, with corresponding massive profits for the syndicate involved, were it not for the good fortune (for the community) that the Applicant and Li were detected and the contents of Unit E15 seized by police. 

132The Applicant was motivated by financial gain. The Applicant was not a drug user. His different accounts concerning the alleged quantum of his profit did not assist him in demonstrating a small expected gain only. The Applicant's account concerning the need for funds for his wife was entirely uncorroborated. A strong inference was available, which the Applicant did not rebut, that substantial financial reward would flow to a person specially imported from overseas to assist in this enterprise, although no precise finding could be made as to the size of the profit he expected to make.

133Her Honour's acceptance of some parts of the Applicant's account does not greatly assist him on this application. Indeed, her Honour's willingness to take those matters into account in the Applicant's favour serves to explain why an even more substantial sentence was not imposed in this case. 

134Consideration of the quantity of drug involved, taken with the Applicant's activities in Australia as an imported member of the syndicate, clearly warranted the finding of objective seriousness made by the sentencing Judge. 

135There is no merit in Ground 2.

136The sentencing Judge had regard to all relevant circumstances, including totality and the sentence imposed in Victoria in 2007. 

137General deterrence and specific deterrence were significant factors on sentence. In the context of drug importation offences, courts have said that the difficulty of detecting such offences, and the great social consequences that follow, suggest that deterrence is to be given chief weight on sentence, and that stern punishment will be warranted in almost every case: Wong v The Queen at 607-608 [64]; R v Nguyen at 127[72](g). These principles have similar application to this case.

138The sentence to be imposed in a case such as this must also signal to would-be drug suppliers that the potential financial rewards to be gained from such activities are neutralised by the risk of severe punishment (R v Nguyen at 127[72](h)), with involvement at any level to attract a significant sentence, otherwise the need for general deterrence will not be served (R v Nguyen at 127[72](i)).

139Her Honour's approach to sentence was thorough, measured and restrained. In the circumstances of the case, the sentence imposed was both open and appropriate. 

140There is no merit in the claim of manifest excess advanced in Ground 3.

Conclusion

141The application for extension of time in this case does not involve a delay of the order seen by this Court in other applications based upon alleged Muldrock error. Further, as counsel for the Applicant observed, at least one aspect of the matter has occurred relatively recently, with Li being sentenced by her Honour on 10 August 2012, and with that sentence itself being the subject of an application for leave to appeal to this Court. 

142The explanation for the delay on the part of the Applicant may be found in his desire to take advantage of the decision in Muldrock. On his own account, the sentence imposed appears to have been less than he expected (see [7] above). No satisfactory explanation has been advanced for the delay in appellate proceedings based upon Grounds 2 and 3.

143The grounds of appeal lack merit. No error has been demonstrated. Even if it had been, and taking into account the further evidence adduced in this Court concerning the Applicant's custodial progress, no lesser sentence is warranted under s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In these circumstances, an extension of time should not be granted.

144The application for extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.

145LATHAM J: I agree with Johnson J.

			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  On 4 June 2012, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of the following offences:
(1) that on 20 October 2011 at Coffs Harbour the appellant did break and enter premises and did commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 112(1)(a);  and
(2) that on 20 October 2011 at Coffs Harbour the appellant did break and enter premises with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, in circumstances of aggravation namely he was armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 113(2).  
2The larceny offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  The aggravated break and enter offence also carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  
3On 27 July 2012, the trial judge, Murrell DCJ (as her Honour then was) imposed the following sentences on the appellant:
(1) for the larceny offence:  a fixed term of 18 months to commence on 23 May 2012 and to expire on 22 November 2013;  
(2) for the aggravated break and enter offence:  a non-parole period of 20 months to commence on 23 September 2012 and to expire on 22 June 2014 with a balance of term of 15 months to expire on 22 September 2015.  
4The total effective sentence imposed on the appellant was a non-parole period of 2 years 1 month to commence on 23 May 2012 and to expire on 22 June 2014 and a total term of 3 years 4 months to expire on 22 September 2015.  
5The appellant has appealed against his convictions on the following grounds:
(1) the trial judge erred in law in failing to leave to the jury an alternative offence of receiving stolen property:  the Crimes Act, s 188;  and
(2) the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
The case at trial
6At trial, the Crown case was that the appellant, on the evening of 20 October 2011, broke into the manager's unit at the Calypso Apartments in Coffs Harbour and stole the keys to two sets of units, namely, units 8 and 10 in those premises, as well as an American Express card.  This was the conduct charged under count 1 (the larceny offence).  The appellant was said to have then gained entry to unit 10 with the set of keys he had stolen from the manager's office.  It was alleged that at the time, he was armed with a knife.  This was the conduct charged under count 2 (the aggravated break and enter offence).  
7At that time, unit 10 was occupied by DF, his partner, CF and their three daughters, including RF, who was then 13 years old.  RF's parents had gone to bed and RF remained up watching television.  Their second daughter was asleep on the lounge.  
8RF first heard knocking at the door.  She went to her parents' bedroom and told her father.  He told her not to worry about it, that ""it was ... too late"".  She returned to the lounge room and saw ""the door handle moving"".  She went back to her parents' room and told her father that ""someone was trying to get in"" to the apartment.  Her father sat back up in bed and she took a couple of steps back into the lounge room when she saw a man standing in the lounge room ""leaning over the couch looking at my baby sister with a knife"".  She ran back into her parents' room and said to her father, ""someone's in the house"".  She said that the man then ran out of the unit. 
9RF's father jumped out of bed and ran outside.  When he returned, he telephoned the police and provided a description of the intruder as a ""skinny"" ""white"" male, with ""grey spiky hair"", in his ""mid to late 40s with a goatee"".  This description, for the most part, came from what RF, who was standing beside him whilst he was speaking to the police on the phone, was telling him.  He gave the police a description of the clothing he saw the man wearing.  
10The appellant was apprehended by two police officers in the presence of his nephew, at a short distance from the apartments.  The police searched the appellant and found him in possession of the American Express card which was identified as belonging to the manager and a set of keys belonging to unit 8.  (The keys to unit 10 had been left in the lock of the door to that unit.) 
11The prosecution case was that the appellant was the intruder who broke into the manager's residence and who entered unit 10.  The defence case was that the appellant was walking by the apartments that evening with his de facto partner's nephew, Anthony Kemp, and saw the credit card and keys lying on the footpath.  He said he picked them up with the intention that either he or his partner (Rebecca Kemp) would hand them to police the next day.  
12There was no issue at trial that the offences had occurred.  It was common ground that the manager's premises at the apartments had been broken into and that someone had entered unit 10.  The issue at trial was whether the jury could be satisfied that the appellant was the offender.  There was also a challenge as to whether the evidence established the circumstances of aggravation, in that the offender was armed with a knife.  No knife was found during a police search of the area.  
13The jury were given directions as to the availability of the offence of break and enter with intent to steal contrary to s 113(1) as an alternative offence to the aggravated break and enter offence.  There were no requests by either the Crown or the defence for corrections or additions to the summing up and no request for any alternate or further directions.  
14The Crown case was essentially a circumstantial one relying upon:  the similarity in appearance of the appellant with the person who had broken into the premises as described by RF to her father, who saw the intruder running from the scene;  the appellant's possession of the American Express card and the keys to unit 8 within about 20-30 minutes of the offences having been committed;  and the presence of the appellant in the vicinity of the premises when stopped by the police.  
15Rebecca Kemp gave evidence that the appellant was in her presence at the time at which the offences were alleged to have occurred.  The appellant also gave evidence at trial.  His evidence was also that he was in his de facto wife's company at the relevant time.  However, he was not specific as to the times he contended that he was with her.  The appellant also gave an innocent explanation for his possession of items stolen from the premises, in that he had found them abandoned on the street and picked them up with the intention to surrender them to police in the hope that he may receive a reward from the owner of the credit card.  
Ground 1:  the trial judge erred in law in failing to leave to the jury an alternative offence of receiving stolen property contrary to the Crimes Act, s 188
16The appellant contended in ground 1 of the appeal that the trial judge should have left to the jury, as an alternate count to the larceny offence, the offence of receiving stolen property:  Crimes Act, s 188.  This ground of appeal required the appellant's acceptance that the jury had rejected his explanation as to how he came into possession of those items.  
17In support of this submission, the appellant submitted that the Crown case relied almost entirely upon the case of recent possession.  During the course of argument on the appeal, the question was raised with counsel whether there was any basis in law upon which the alternative count was, in any event, available.  The appellant and the Crown were invited to provide further written submissions on this point.
18The appellant, in his further written submissions dated 2 August 2013, conceded that this ground must fail, as it would not have been permissible for the trial judge to leave the alternative offence of receiving stolen property to the jury.  I have considered the relevant statutory provisions and the common law and accept that this concession is properly made.  The reasons for this are, briefly, as follows.
19The larceny offence under s 112(1)(a) falls within the Crimes Act, Pt 4:  ""Stealing and similar offences"", Div 4:  ""Sacrilege and housebreaking"".  Section 115A falls within the same Division and provides for alternative verdicts for specified aggravated offences and special aggravated offences.  There is no alternative verdict prescribed in s 115 for an offence under s 112(1)(a).
20The Crimes Act, s 121 provides:
""121 Verdict of 'larceny or receiving'
Where, on the trial of a person charged with larceny, or any offence which includes larceny, and, also, with having unlawfully received the property charged to have been stolen, knowing it to have been stolen, the jury find specially that the person either stole, or unlawfully received, such property, and that they are unable to say which of those offences was committed by the person, such person shall not by reason thereof be entitled to acquittal, but shall be liable to be sentenced for the larceny, or for the unlawful receiving, whichever of the two offences is subject to the lesser punishment.""
21A special verdict is only available under s 121 if the person is charged with both offences:  see R v McCarthy and Ryan (1993) 71 A Crim R 395, where Hunt CJ at CL (Wood J and Smart J agreeing) stated, at 399, that as the accused had not been charged with both larceny and receiving in the alternative, the special verdict of larceny or receiving permitted by s 121 was not available.  In the present case, the appellant was not charged with both offences.  Accordingly, any argument based on s 121 must be rejected. 
22In R v Springfield (1969) 53 Cr App R 608 the Court stated, at 611, that an alternative count will only be available at common law where:
""... it is a necessary step towards establishing the major offence to prove the commission of the lesser offence: in other words, is the lesser offence an essential ingredient of the major one?""
23This test was applied by this Court in R v Aldrich (1993) 67 A Crim R 371 at 376.  
24In McCarthy and Ryan Hunt CJ at CL, after rejecting the availability of an alternative 'special' verdict under s 121, said that it was therefore necessary for the Crown, who relied upon recent possession and the absence of any satisfactory explanation for that possession, to establish that the accused was guilty of larceny rather than receiving.  However, his Honour, at 399, observed that the offences of larceny and receiving are mutually exclusive, citing a long line of authority for that proposition.  
25I would only add as a matter of record that at common law it is not necessary that the alternative count be charged on the indictment:  see R v King [2004] NSWCCA 20; 59 NSWLR 515;  Mifsud v R [2009] NSWCCA 313;  cf Nguyen v R (1992) 60 A Crim R 196, where the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal (Crockwell J, Phillips CJ and Southwell J agreeing) stated, at 199, that at common law it was necessary that both offences had to be charged before alternative verdicts could be left to the jury. 
26The appellant also relied upon the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, Sch 3, Pt 3, s 7.  That section makes provision for charging in the one indictment, the offences of stealing and receiving.  Section 7 provides:
""7 Stealing and receiving in one indictment
(1) In an indictment containing a charge of stealing property, a further charge may be added against the same person for unlawfully receiving the property, or any part of the property, knowing it to have been stolen.
(2) The prosecutor is not to be put to election as to those charges.""
27Section 7 does not relate to alternative verdicts.  Rather, it is a procedural provision which permits charges of stealing and unlawfully receiving the same property to be included in the same indictment.  If that occurs, the provisions of s 121 then apply.  However, as I have already stated, the appellant was not charged with counts of both larceny and receiving.  He was only charged, relevantly for the purposes of this ground of appeal, with larceny under s 112(1)(a), 
28It follows that there was no basis in this case, either pursuant to statute or under the common law, whereby an alternative verdict was available and, accordingly, there could be no requirement for the trial judge to direct the jury in respect of the availability of an alternative offence of receiving.
29Ground 1, as was conceded, must be rejected.
Ground two:  the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence
30The appellant's second ground of appeal was that his conviction is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The law in relation to this ground of appeal is well settled.
31The Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1) provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal:
""... shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence ...""
32In M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63;  181 CLR 487, at 493, per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ, the High Court stated that the test to be applied in determining whether the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence was as follows:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict ... the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""
33Earlier in M, at 492, their Honours had said:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'"" (citations omitted).
34The Court added, at 494:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
35M was approved in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53;  213 CLR 606.  Their Honours noted that for the purposes of s 6(1), the starting point was that the jury had the primary function in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.  It was integral to that proposition that the jury had seen and heard the witnesses.  
36In applying this test, the Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence process as to its sufficiency and its quality:  SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400, the plurality, French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ, reaffirming the test to be applied in determining whether the verdict was unreasonable was that stated in M and MFA.
37In Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30;  230 CLR 559 at [113], Hayne J (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing), stated:
""It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence ... That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.""  (citation omitted)
The evidence at trial 
38I have already referred above to the offending conduct, namely, the break and entry into the manager's office and the aggravated entry into unit 10.  A significant part of the Crown case was based upon the description given of the intruder by RF and the similarity of that description to the physical appearance of the appellant.  There was other evidence, including the appellant having the stolen items in his possession and evidence of his movements that evening.  A consideration of the evidence at trial follows.
Evidence of RF
39A pre-recorded and edited DVD of RF's interview with police, conducted at 12:30 am on 21 October 2011 (the recorded interview), was placed before the jury.  RF described hearing knocking on the door and seeing the handle of the door turning.  She described how she went to tell her father of the knocking and then returned to the bedroom to tell him about the door handle moving.  She said that when she came out of the bedroom, she had taken one or two steps into the lounge room when she saw the intruder ""leaning over the couch looking at my baby sister with a knife"".  RF said that when she saw that she made a sound, which she described in her evidence, and was recorded as ""Uhh"".  
40RF described the man as having ""hair coming down"" his chin.  She reiterated that the intruder had ""something in his hand ... It looked like a knife"".  She said he had it in the hand that was closest to the door.  She thought it was in his right hand.  She described ""the black thing in his hand and the knife was like about there"".  It is apparent from the record of interview that, at this point, RF was demonstrating how long the knife was.  The interviewing police officer assessed it as being ""probably 6 inches"" and in response to a further question, RF agreed that it was ""about 6 inches ... maybe something like 15 centimetres"".  She said the blade was silver and that as soon as the intruder saw her he ""turned around and started going out the door"".  She ran back into her parents' bedroom.  She said that her father ran outside.
41RF said the intruder was wearing black pants and his ""t-shirt was white and it had something on it"".  When asked to describe it, she said, ""[i]t was just like around because when the screen went bright I saw things like, on his t-shirt"".  She agreed he had a bit of a ""bit of a beard"", which was ""whitey grey"".  She said his hair was grey and ""a bit spiky"".
42RF described the person as thin and that he was neither tall nor short.  She said he was a ""bit taller"" than her father.  She said he was ""white"" and agreed by that she meant Caucasian.  She referred again to his t-shirt, saying that she thought ""he had like grey on his t-shirt"".  She added ""there was definitely like stuff on his t-shirt"".  She was asked about his age and first said, ""I don't think he was over like 55"".  She was asked her father's age, which was 42, and was then asked, by comparison with her father, how old the person would have been.  She replied, ""I think about 45 maybe he would have been"".
43She described herself as being very ""freaked out"" by the knife.  She said she told her parents what the intruder was wearing.  
44RF said that after the police arrived she went outside and saw two people with police officers.  She described one as having, ""[a] beard and the t-shirt"".  She said that as soon as this person saw her he said, ""I've got kids of my own, I would never do that and everything"".  The police questioning continued as follows:
""Q198 ... And you're saying that one of [the men with the police] had a beard and he had a shirt, the t-shirt
A Yeah 
... But I couldn't see him close up, I could like see him like, I only had to take like five more steps and I would have been yeah ...""
45RF was cross-examined at the trial.  Three areas of her evidence were subject to particular scrutiny by the appellant's counsel.  They were the length of time RF looked at the intruder, the intruder's clothes and the knife he was said to be carrying.
46In her recorded interview, RF was asked how long she thought she actually ""got a look at [the intruder] in the room"".  She answered, ""[a]bout 30 seconds straight"".  She was then asked ""[r]eally quick?"".  She responded ""[y]eah"".  She then said ""'[c]ause I just looked up, froze like for 30 seconds and then I went [demonstrating sound]"".  In cross-examination, she agreed that she had not looked at the intruder for anywhere near as long as 30 seconds.  It was suggested to her that it was more like ""3 seconds or less"".  RF responded:
""I'm not quite sure because he turned around and looked at me, and then I run into mum and dad's room and he was out the door when dad run out."" 
47RF was asked some further questions and then was asked:
""... but I imagine, that wouldn't have taken any more than 3 seconds to turn from the couch ...?A.  Yep.
Q.  And that is as long as you saw him for in your apartment?A.  Yep.""  
48The second area of challenge related to RF's description of what the intruder was wearing.  Whilst her father was speaking to the police in the emergency telephone call, RF described the intruder as wearing a white shirt with something on the front of it.  In her recorded interview, RF was asked to describe the intruder ""from the top of his head to the tip of his toes"" and to try not to leave anything out.  In her answer, she referred to the intruder wearing ""the t-shirt was white and it had something on it"".
49She was then asked, ""[w]here was the something? On the front, the back or somewhere else?"".  RF responded:
""It was just like, around because when the screen went bright I saw things like, on his t-shirt.""
50RF was cross-examined as to the description that she had given at various times as to what the intruder was wearing.  She agreed that she did not mention to her father when he was making the emergency telephone call to the police that it was a grey and white striped t-shirt and all that she said was that the t-shirt was white with something on the front.  She also agreed that she said nothing about the intruder wearing a jacket or having tattoos on his arms.  She agreed that she had not noticed any tattoos on either of the intruder's arms.  She also agreed that she did not see the intruder wearing a bumbag.  She was definite that he was not wearing blue denim jeans.
51The third area of challenge was to RF's evidence that she saw a knife.  In cross-examination, RF agreed that when she told her father that there was someone in the room, she did not tell him that the person had a knife.  RF was asked whether it was right that she didn't tell her father about the knife until just before he made the emergency telephone call.  However, RF was not really sure.  She only said, ""Dad there's someone in the house"".  She agreed that it was frightening to see a man in the house, but ""even more super frightening"" to see a man with a knife.  She also agreed that the most frightening thing about the man would have been that he had a knife in his hand.  Presumably, the intention of this cross-examination was to demonstrate that had she seen a knife it would be likely that she would have told her father immediately.  
52It was suggested to her that she did not say anything to her mother about the knife whilst her father was outside and that the first time she mentioned the knife was just before her father made the triple 0 call from the lounge room.  She responded that she was ""pretty sure"" she did refer to a knife when she was telling her mother what had happened.  She agreed, however, that she could not remember ""what I said that night to no one"".  Pressed further, she was asked if she had told her mum that the man had a knife, whether she would remember that.  She responded, ""I think so.  Yeah"".  
53Another aspect of challenge to RF's evidence about the knife was whether her father got a knife from the kitchen.  In her record of interview, she said that her father had got a knife to show her and she had said that the knife was ""like half of that knife"".  
54She was cross-examined about this is as follows:
""Q.  When dad came back to the unit and you told him about the knife?A.  Yep.
Q.  We heard you describe to the detective on the video that in telling dad about the knife, dad went and got a knife from - I couldn't hear exactly what you said, but it sounded like 'our kitchen' or something like that?A.  Yeah, the kitchen.
Q.  Dad went and got a knife from the kitchen and showed it to you, and you said, 'Yeah, like about half that size'?A.  Yeah.
Q.  He went and got a knife from the kitchen, did he?A.  Yeah.  
Q.  Are you absolutely sure that happened?  About dad and the knife?A.  I think I pulled it out of the thing and - because dad said, 'How big was the knife?' and I pulled it out and I showed him.
Q.  So maybe you went and got a knife, not dad?A.  Yeah, I was standing in the kitchen and I got it out of the thing because dad asked me how big it was.
Q.  What kind of knife did you - can you describe for us the knife that you got out of the kitchen?A.  It was like - I don't know whether they chop meat - [meat] and stuff with it, I think.
Q.  Did you show that to the police when they came, so you could give them an idea of what the knife they were looking for could be compared to?A.  No, I don't think I did.  I can't remember.
Q.  All right.  What happened to that knife after you, or dad, had a look at it in the kitchen to compare it?A.  I put it back in the drawer and then I went and sat on the couch.
Q.  And dad was there when that happened?A.  Yeah, I think so.  I think he was on the phone actually.""  
55RF was also cross-examined as to the statements she made to the police in the record of interview.  The purpose of this cross-examination was clearly to suggest that her statement that there was a knife was unreliable.  The cross-examination was as follows:
""Q.  The knife you said the man had, you said was about half the size of the knife that you went and looked at in your apartment?A.  Yes.
Q.  And we saw some measurements in the interview, and eventually you and the detective agreed that the knife that you say the man had was 15 centimetres in the blade?A.  Yeah.  
Q.  And you say that was about half the size of the one that you looked at?A.  Yeah.
Q.  Double 15 is 30 isn't it?  Two times 15 is 30?A.  Yeah.  
Q.  30 centimetres is the length of a school ruler.  You can picture that, can't you?A.  Yeah.  
Q.  Well, does that mean the knife you looked at in your kitchen had a blade as long as a school ruler?A.  It was probably a bit shorter than that.
Q.  How much shorter?A.  I'm not sure cause I can't really remember.
Q.  In your interview that we have all just watched you were making an effort to be very honest in what you told the detective?A.  Yes.
Q.  You wanted to tell the truth, and not exaggerate or make things up?  Is that what you wanted to do?A.  Yep.  
Q.  Let's just recap what you said about the knife in the interview.  You said at question 94 ... 'It looked like a knife.'  Do you remember you said that?A.  Yeah.  
Q.  You thought maybe it was in his right hand?A.  Yes.  
...
Q.  And then a little bit later in describing it, you said--
...
Q.  -it looked like a knife to me, a bit?A.  I can't really remember.  I think it was a knife because - yeah.
Q.  Is this the case [RF] that although you're absolutely certain that there was a man in your apartment--A.  Yes.
Q.  -that you do have some doubt about whether what he had in his hand was a knife?A.  He did have something in his hand and it looked like a knife to me, a bit.  I don't know.
Q.  But you don't know?A.  What other people thought it might have been, it looked like a knife to me.
Q.  It looked like a knife to you?A.  Yeah.
Q.  Is that because you saw something silver?A.  Yeah.
Q.  Door keys are also silver aren't they?A.  Yeah, but the keys were in the door.""  
Evidence of RF's father
56In his examination in chief, RF's father confirmed that he and his wife had gone to bed and that RF had remained in the lounge room watching television.  Another of his daughters was asleep on the lounge.  He said that RF came into his room and told him someone was knocking on the door and that he told her not to worry about it, because the person would go away.  He said RF came back about 3 to 5 minutes later and said ""Dad, they're trying to get in.  They're trying to open the door"".  He said he got up and sat on the bed and listened, but the noise stopped.  
57RF's father said about 30 seconds later, RF came back in and said ""[t]here's someone standing in the door, Dad.  There's someone standing in the house, in the lounge room"".  He said he jumped out of bed and yelled out.  He did not personally see anyone in the house.  He said he ""flew out the door"" of the unit and saw ""a glimpse of a bloke going up towards Link Road"".  The person he saw was still on Prince Street, about three or four houses away.  He was asked whether he could make out what the person was wearing and said, ""[i]t was a light-coloured t-shirt and I think it was striped"".  He said he was able to see that from the lights on the street.  
58He returned to the unit.  He described his daughter as being ""absolutely petrified"" and that she was saying, ""[h]e had a knife, dad.  He had a knife, dad"".  He said he also observed a set of keys in the door.  He telephoned triple 0 and spoke to police emergency.  He said RF was standing close to him whilst he made this telephone call.  He said that RF had not told him about the knife until just before he rang triple 0.  He also said he did not go and get a knife from his own kitchen to assist her to identify how big the knife was.
59A transcript of the triple 0 call was tendered in evidence.  RF's father is identified on the transcript as V1 and RF as V4.  The police emergency operator is identified as V2.
60Having informed the police emergency operator that a man had entered the unit, he was asked whether he could give a description of the intruder.  The following description was then given:
""V.1 ... there was just one bloke ......Skinny bloke ---...
V.2 ---nationality mate?  A white Australian male or ---
V.1 He was Australian wasn't he?  A white fella?
V.4 He was white and he, he had grey spiky hair....
V.1 ... mid to late 40s with a, with a goatee.
V.2 Mid to late 40s, so grey spiky hair and could they recall what he was wearing mate at all?
V.1 What was he wearing again?
V.4 I, I think he had ... and he had a white t-shirt ---
V.1 White t-shirt.
V.4 --- with something on the front of the t-shirt.
V.1 White t-shirt with something on the front of it, she's not sure what it was 'cause she was scared....
... black pants like track pants....
... he was standing there with a knife and ---""  
61RF's father also gave evidence as to what occurred when the police arrived.  He said that there were two police officers outside in the vicinity of the apartments, who had two persons in their custody.  He described one man as being older and one being younger and that the older man was wearing a white t-shirt with a print on it.  
62RF had also gone outside.  Her father said that they were about ""eight to ten feet"" from where the two males were being held by the police officers.  He said that RF was crying.  He asked her, ""[i]s that the man?"" and she responded ""I can't see, dad, I don't know"".  He agreed that the first time he saw one of the persons wearing a shirt which was striped was when he was about 8 to 10 feet away from the two men in police custody.  He also said it was possible that he heard his daughter say, ""I don't think that's him"".  However, he said that when she looked more closely at the two men being held by the police she said, ""that's him"".  
RF's mother
63RF's mother did not see the intruder.  However, she was cross-examined as to the time that RF would have been able to see the intruder.  That evidence was follows:
""Q.  You've said that when [R F] told you about the handle moving, having told you about the handle moving she took one step into the lounge and then one step back into your room?A.  Yes.
Q.  To say there's someone in the apartment?A.  Yes.  
Q.  So the time between taking one step out into the lounge room and the one step back into your bedroom to say there was a man would have been, I suggest, one to two seconds?A.  Yes.  
Q.  She didn't at that stage say to you anything other than, 'There's a man in the apartment'?A.  No, and just that he had a knife, he was standing over our youngest daughter.
Q.  She didn't actually mention the knife at that stage, though, did she?A.  No.
...
Q.  It would have been about 20 minutes while [RF'S father] he was [outside]?A.  Yes.
Q.  You spent that 20 minutes with [RF]?A.  Yes, I did.
Q.  In that time that you spent with her she didn't mention the knife?A.  She mentioned the knife more or less straight away after she said he'd entered and [DF] [w]ent outside she said she had a knife and --
Q.  Did she or you or [DF] ever go to the kitchen and get a knife for her to look at?A.  No, not that I recall, no.""  
The police evidence 
64Police Constable Herbert and Senior Constable Knowles were driving around the area in clearly marked police car.  At 10.43 pm a broadcast came over the police radio regarding a break and enter.  They were driving west along Prince Street and Constable Herbert observed two males on the side of the road, one of whom matched the description of the suspect that had come over the police radio.  Constable Herbert searched the appellant and found, inter alia, the American Express card and a keyring with a silver key on it and a key tag labelled unit 8.  The appellant was dressed in a black jacket when he was noticed by the police.  The jacket was taken off during the course of the search of the appellant.  Constable Herbert did not recall that the appellant's arms were fully tattooed.
65Constable Herbert and Senior Constable Knowles stayed at the crime scene after the appellant was taken to the police station.  Constable Herbert noticed a chair in the garden bed in the front yard of the apartment complex and saw the window directly above it was broken.  He said that the ""flyscreen to that window was bent in half.  Underneath the chair with three small silver screwdrivers"".
66Constable Herbert arrested the appellant when he found an American Express card in the name of another person in the pocket of the appellant's pants.
67Senior Constable Knowles said that as the two males were walking along the street approaching the police car, they made no attempt to run away.  One of the males approached a window of the police car before he and Senior Constable Knowles had got out of the vehicle.  He said that it was after he had a brief conversation with the male who approached the window of the police car, that he realised that the other man matched the description that was broadcast over the police radio of ""a Caucasian male about 40 with a beard"".  
68Senior Constable Knowles searched the man with the appellant.  He found nothing on him and he was subsequently allowed to go.
69Senior Constable Knowles also searched the area and made similar observations as Constable Herbert of the chair, the window and the fly screen.  He also described how the office had been disturbed.
70Senior Constables Hall and Osborne attended the apartment complex at about 10.45 pm.  Senior Constable Hall recalled Constable Herbert telling the accused that he was under arrest.  Senior Constable Hall placed the accused in the police truck and transported him to Coffs Harbour Police Station.
71Senior Constable Osborne undertook a search of the apartment complex and observed a chair in the garden bed and two small jewellers' screwdrivers nearby.  He observed that one of the persons who had been apprehended by the other police officers was about ""40 years old, fair complexion and medium build wearing blue denim jeans, a white T-shirt and black padded jacket and black shoes"".  He took the key that had been found in possession of the appellant and tested it on unit 8.  
72Detective Sergeant Rhodes-Sanders, the officer in charge, attended the apartment complex at about 11.30 pm.  Detective Rhodes-Sanders stated that she observed a chair below a window on the first floor and the fly screen pulled back and the window open.  She went into the office area and saw drawers open and paper work scattered around.  She later conducted the recorded interview with RF.  Detective Rhodes-Sanders also gave evidence that it was a 3 minute drive or a 12 minute walk from the Hoey Moey bottle shop to the apartment complex.  
73Detective Rhodes-Sanders gave a direction on the night that the area be searched.  She said that a ""general canvass was conducted of the area searching for the knife"".  She was not able to identify the extent of the search other than to refer to the ""immediate vicinity and along the street"".  She said that the general duties police officers on the night conducted the search and there was a follow-up canvass the following morning by one of the detectives.  There was no evidence of who undertook the search of the area.
74In cross-examination, Detective Rhodes-Sanders said that she had no reason to believe other than that the search was conducted in a thorough and competent manner.  She also said that RF's father had given the officers the direction in which the intruder had run from the units, mainly down Prince Street and then left onto Hogbin Drive.  
75Detective Rhodes-Sanders also said that from her inspection of the fly screen on the window of the office, there was no indication that it had been cut with a knife, but that it had been pulled out and bent.
The other Crown evidence 
76The Crown also called Rebecca Burn, the de facto wife of Mark Kemp.  Mark Kemp's sister is Robyn Kemp, the de facto wife of the appellant.  Mark Kemp's son Anthony Kemp was in the company of the appellant at the time of his arrest.  
Evidence of Ms Burn
77Ms Burn said that the appellant and Robyn Kemp were staying with her and Mark Kemp at the time of his arrest.  At about 8 pm, the appellant, Robyn Kemp and Anthony Kemp went to the Plaza.  She watched television until about 9:26 pm.  She said that she next heard Robyn Kemp at about 10 minutes to 10 when she returned and the appellant and Anthony Kemp about 5 minutes later when they returned to the house.  
78She said that the appellant and Anthony Kemp left the house fairly soon after that as ""they were going down to the pub to get a drink"".  She could not give the time that they left the house.  She also said that once she went to bed she didn't hear from them until the police arrived and that she didn't know ""for certain"" whether they had gone out, but just assumed so.  She described the appellant as wearing, on the night, light jeans, a ""t-shirt with a grey stripe and then a white stripe and a grey ... polo shirt"". 
79Ms Burn said that she was woken about 11:30 pm when the police arrived. 
Evidence of Robyn Kemp
80Robyn Kemp said that she went to the Plaza with the appellant and Anthony Kemp at about 8 pm, arriving at about 8:30 pm.  She said they went to the Hoey Moey Hotel.  She returned home at 9:50 pm.  The appellant and Anthony Kemp arrived shortly afterwards.  She said the appellant and Anthony Kemp wanted to go back to the bottle shop but she told them it would be too late.  She said at that time it was roughly 10:40 or 10:45 pm.  She said that on that night the appellant was wearing blue jeans, a white grey polo shirt with red stripes and a brown jacket.
81Ms Kemp said that she was with the appellant and Anthony Kemp ""most of the time"" during the period after they had returned to the house until they left again at about 10:40 or 10:45 pm.  She said that the only time she was not with them was when she went to get another glass of beer, which would have been a distance of 3 to 4 m, and that she would have been away for less than a minute on these occasions.  She agreed that apart from those two short periods, the appellant was in her ""immediate company the whole time"".
82Ms Kemp said she knew it was about 10:40 or 10:45 pm when the appellant said they were going to the bottle shop, because she checked the clock and she said that she told them the bottle shop would be shut, as it closed at 10:30 pm.  She said, however, that they had said they just wanted ""to go for a walk to check to see if it was open"".  She said Anthony Kemp came back about 20 to 25 minutes later and she rang the police station on her mobile phone at 11:28 pm.
Photographic evidence
83Photographs of the vicinity were tendered in evidence.  Photograph Exh G was described as ""Bush-road opposite Calypso Apartments"".  Photograph Exh H was described as ""Front view of Park/Bushland (road opposite Calypso Apartments)"".  These photographs show an extensive, relatively heavily treed area. 
CCTV footage
84There was tendered at trial CCTV footage showing the driveway at the bottle shop of the Hotel known as the Hoey Moey.  For the purposes of the appeal, three still screenshots from the CCTV footage were provided to the Court.  Those screenshots were in respect of the times 20.19.59;  20.20.01;  and 20.20.06.  Each showed the appellant on the driveway of the hotel.  In each still, he is depicted as wearing blue denim jeans, black jacket and a grey and white striped shirt.  The shirt had a collar on it and would commonly be described as a polo shirt.  
Forensic evidence
85A decision had initially been taken that the incident did not meet the threshold requirements for immediate attendance of forensic examiners.  However, the next day, a request was made that the scene be examined for fingerprints and DNA material.  A statement of agreed facts pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995, s 191 was tendered in respect of the examination that was undertaken.
86Three fingerprints were uplifted from the back of the chair, which was below the window through which entry had been allegedly obtained into the office.  These did not match those of the accused or anyone on the police data base.  The window and fly screen were very dirty and no fingerprints were able to be developed.  The internal door handles of the office and drawers were not examined.  It was considered that the ""mechanics of opening a drawer permit the fingers to contact the back of the handle"", so as to make it unworkable for the examination for fingerprints.  
87The door handles were not examined, as door handles in a motel complex are considered a ""high traffic item"", causing a build up of oil, making it, in effect, impossible to obtain fingerprints.  In addition:
""... Forensic Service Group Standard operating procedures indicates that targeting for trace DNA on 'non porous surfaces' such as door handles is not encouraged because they are unlikely to yield DNA as there is no prolonged or forceful contact with the skin.""  
88Fingerprint examination was undertaken of the keys found in the door to unit 10.  No fingerprints were identified on the keys or the white tag attached to the keys.  No DNA swabbing was done of the keys and key tag to unit 10 because of ""multiple handling"" issues and the Division of Analytical Laboratories does not accept swabs from keys, particularly those from motels.  There was also a contamination issue, as those keys had been placed in the same exhibit bag as the screwdrivers found in the appellant's bumbag.
89The screwdrivers were not dusted for fingerprints due to the nature of their surface.  DNA testing was not undertaken because of the issue with contamination referred to in respect of the keys.
90The American Express Card and keys to unit 8 were not tested, as it was stated this would have been of no evidentiary value.
91There was no evidence the intruder touched anything and he was only in the premises for a short period of time.
The defence evidence
92The appellant gave evidence. 
93The appellant said that that evening he had gone to the Plaza with Ms Kemp and Anthony Kemp.  He said they returned to the house and were sitting on the back steps.  Robyn Kemp came out and joined them.  He said that he and Anthony Kemp then went back to try and buy some more alcohol.  He said that Robyn Kemp told them that the bottle shop would probably be closed.  He said notwithstanding that, they left, but ""got stopped on the way there by the police"".  He said that during the whole of the period between returning home and leaving to go to the bottle shop he had been sitting on the back stairs of the house.
94He said that as he and Anthony Kemp were returning to the hotel, he ""spotted something on the side of the road and walked over and grabbed it and it was a credit card and keys"".  He said the items were near the park on the southern side of Princes Street, ""straight out the front towards the holiday apartments"".  He said there was nothing on the tag that indicated to whom the keys belonged.  He said there was a name on the credit card but did not recognise it.  He said he put the items in his pocket.  
95The appellant agreed that the park was directly opposite the apartments and that it was necessary to walk past the apartments to go to the hotel.  The appellant said that having found the items, he and Anthony Kemp started walking towards the beach to go to the Hotel.  He saw a police truck driving towards them.  He said the vehicle paused and they walked towards it.  He said that Anthony Kemp was talking to the police officers and he was beside him.  He heard the police officer ask where they were going and Anthony respond that they were ""going to the pub"".  The police officer in the passenger seat then said ""[h]ang on, he fits the description"" and the officers got out of the car and walked the appellant and Mr Kemp across the road and sat them down in the gutter on the same side as the apartments.  
96Constable Herbert informed the appellant that he was going to search him and asked whether he had anything on him he should not have.  He said he responded ""No"", because he had some marijuana in his bumbag and thought if he said ""No"", he would not get searched.
97The appellant said he saw ""two police officers there, a little girl and the little girl's father as far as I knew"".  He heard the father say ""Is that the man, is that the man?"".  At that point, the appellant did not hear what the little girl said, as she was sobbing.  He said that the little girl and her father moved closer and were about 2 to 3 m from him.  He said that he thought he heard the little girl said ""[n]o, I don't think that's them"" in response to a question by a female police officer.  He said that when he heard her say that, he said, ""I wouldn't do anything to hurt a kid because I've got kids of my own"".  He said he addressed those words to the police officers.
98The appellant showed his arms to the jury and described extensive tattooing on both arms.  On the right arm, the tattoo went from his bicep to the wrist and on the left it went from the upper bicep down to the wrist and onto the palm of his hand.  The tattoo ink was ""bluey green"".  
Consideration
99The appellant submitted it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the offences with which he was charged.  He contended that the Crown case was one of recent possession and that was the critical issue in the case.  He contended that an hypothesis consistent with innocence was that he was in possession of the items disposed of by the intruder.  Those items, namely, the American Express card and the keys, could easily have been disposed of by the intruder so as to innocently come into the appellant's possession by his finding them on the side of the road.  He also relied upon the time lapse between the time when the offences occurred and the appellant being detained with the stolen items in his possession.
100The appellant submitted that the following factors also indicated that the verdict was unreasonable:  no knife was ever found;  the intruder was seen fleeing the location, whereas he was detained close by;  there was, on one view of the evidence, exculpatory identification evidence by the principal witness, RF, who gave a description of the intruder to her father, and on another view, weak inconclusive in identification evidence, which was open to being tainted by RF seeing the appellant when he was arrested by the police;  and there was no forensic evidence linking the appellant to the interior of either of the premises.
101The principal thrust of the Crown case was that the appellant had been clearly identified by RF as the person who had entered unit 10, he had been detained by police on the basis of that description near the units shortly afterwards, and was found in possession of the stolen items.  It should be noted that the appellant made no complaint as to the directions given by the trial judge in respect of the identification evidence.  
102The appellant submitted, however, that the identification evidence was weak and inconclusive.  The submission advanced was twofold.  First, that RF's evidence had to be viewed in the context that first she gave a description to her father whilst he was making the triple 0 call but had made her recorded interview shortly after having seen the appellant being detained by police.  Secondly, RF's father's evidence was also to be considered in the context that he too saw the intruder at the time he was detained by the police so that his evidence of the intruder wearing a ""light coloured t-shirt and I think it was striped"" may have been affected by what he saw at that point rather than what he saw as the intruder was running up the street. 
103It is convenient therefore to focus on the identification of the intruder that was given to the police in the triple 0 call.  At that time, RF had not been outside the unit and thus had not seen the appellant sitting on the side of the road in police custody.  It is apparent from the evidence that RF's father was conveying to the police the description that RF had given to him just before he made the call.  The description to the police was that the intruder was ""skinny"", ""white"", in his ""mid to late 40s"", that he had ""grey spiky hair"" and ""a goatee"" beard.  The appellant was in fact a lightly built Caucasian male with short grey spiky hair and a goatee beard.  This was apparent from the CCTV footage taken of him on the night and was consistent with all the other evidence at trial.  These aspects of the description were not disputed in the evidence at trial.  He was aged 38 years 6 months at the time of the offence.  A description of mid to late 40s was not inconsistent with the CCTV footage.  
104During the triple 0 call to the police, RF said that intruder was wearing a white t-shirt with something on the front of it.  She said he was wearing black pants.  There is no doubt that on the night the appellant was wearing a white and grey striped polo shirt.  That is depicted in the CCTV footage.  At that time he was also wearing a black jacket.  In his evidence, the appellant said that the shirt had ""Billabong written across the front in red"".  Robyn Kemp had described the shirt as ""white grey with red stripes going through it"".  
105RF did not see whether the intruder had tattoos on both arms.  
106In the recorded interview, RF described the ""t-shirt"" as ""white and it had something on it"".  She was asked ""[w]here was the something?"" and she answered, ""[i]t was just like, around because when the screen went bright I saw things like, on his t-shirt"".  This remained consistent with the description given to the police during the triple 0 interview. 
107RF's description of the appellant's height given in the recorded interview was not challenged.  It was consistent with the appellant's height. 
108In my opinion, the essential description given of the appellant, before RF saw him in the custody of the police, was as close to a perfect match as could be given.  There was one error and one omission in the description.  The error was the colour of the pants he was wearing.  The omission was the tattooing on his arms.  RF did not deny that there was tattooing.  She did not observe it. However, neither of those deficits in RF's observations is sufficient to undermine the clear and accurate description she otherwise gave of him, bearing in mind that her observations were for a brief period, perhaps for about three seconds.  
109The fact that her father's description of the shirt that the intruder was wearing was given after he had seen the appellant in police custody does not undermine RF's description in the slightest.  I would reject this aspect of the appellant's argument.  
110The next matter upon which the appellant relied was the failure to find a knife.  RF gave a description of the knife and the hand in which the knife was being held (the appellant's right hand).  She explained how she was able to see it because of the light coming from the television.  She said she first mentioned the knife to her mother when her father was outside.  It is apparent from the evidence that she told her father about it when he returned and before he rang the police.  She also explained how her father had got a knife from the kitchen and she assessed the size of the knife against the knife he showed her.  In cross-examination, she said she might have got a knife from the drawer to show her father.  
111No knife was found at the scene.  The evidence of the extent of the search for a knife was scant.  The only evidence was that Detective Rhodes-Sanders had directed that a search be undertaken and that she had no reason to believe other than that it was thorough and competent.  The area in the vicinity of the apartments was bushy and the appellant and Anthony Kemp had been away walking in the vicinity for approximately 20-30 minutes before they were apprehended by the police.  Whilst the fact that no knife was found was important, subject to any questions that arise out of RF's evidence that her father went to the kitchen and got a knife, the failure to find a knife does not raise, in my mind, a doubt that the appellant did not have a knife.  
112That leaves for consideration RF's evidence that her father went into the kitchen to get a knife by which she assessed the size of the knife that the intruder was holding.  RF's evidence varied on this.  In her recorded interview, RF said that her father had gone into the kitchen.  Under cross-examination, she said she thought she pulled the knife out of the drawer.  She described it as getting it ""out of the thing"".  She said that after showing her father, she put it back in the drawer.  Her father said he did not take a knife and show it to her.  Her mother did not see that occur.  RF's father was not asked whether RF got a knife and showed it to him, although his evidence was given before she gave her evidence.  
113Notwithstanding this difference in her evidence, RF said from an early point that the intruder had a knife.  Her description of the knife did not change, save perhaps for a very slight difference in her estimation of its length.  There was no challenge to the evidence that the intruder was holding the knife in his right hand, nor was it suggested that the appellant was not right-handed.  Whether or not she was mistaken about her father showing her a knife, her point of reference as to the size of a knife was with a knife in the kitchen.  
114Whether she was mistaken that her father showed her the knife or she got the knife and showed her father, or whether her father could have forgotten this part of the events, does not mean that RF did not see a knife.  Further, although the cross-examination was directed at undermining her evidence that she saw a knife, it was never suggested directly to her that she did not do so.  The most that was put to her was that keys are also silver.  That aspect of the cross-examination is set out above at [60].  In my opinion, it was a convincing rebuttal of any suggestion that what she saw was anything but a knife.
115In my opinion, having regard to RF's evidence as a whole, I am satisfied that the person she saw had a knife.
116The next basis upon which it was alleged that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence was the absence of any forensic evidence linking the appellant to the interior of the premises.  In my opinion, having regard to the difficulty in obtaining forensic evidence as described in the agreed statement of facts, particularly from the door handles, this aspect of the appellant's challenge does not throw doubt upon the otherwise unassailable description of the appellant having been the person who entered into unit 10.  
117One further factor should be mentioned, although not specifically raised by the appellant in argument on this ground, and that is the evidence of Robyn Kemp that the appellant and Anthony Kemp did not leave the house until between approximately 10 pm and 10:40-10:45 pm.  The appellant and Anthony Kemp were first seen by the police at 10:43-10:45 pm.  It was a 12 minute walk from the house to the apartments.  On those times, they had to have left the house at the latest by 10:33 pm.  The offences had occurred by then.  RF's father's evidence was that the break and enter into unit 10 occurred between 10 and 10:30 pm.  He had been outside for at least 20 minutes after RF told him that a person was in the house.  There had to be added to that the time taken to telephone the police and for the police to send out a message over police radio.  The offences, therefore, must have occurred between about 10 pm and 10:20 pm.
118Whilst there is not an overly divergent discrepancy with Robyn Kemp's evidence and it might have been considered to be a reasonable estimate, the fact is she said in cross-examination that she looked at the clock when the appellant said that they were going to the bottle shop and saw that it was 20 minutes or quarter to 11.  The discrepancy is therefore significant.  It is also to be remembered that Robyn Kemp said that she separated from the appellant and Anthony Kemp at the park near the apartment building, although she said that they came back to the house a short time later.  
119The Crown had to prove and the jury had to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant broke and entered into the manager's unit and stole the American Express card and the keys to units 8 and 10 so as to be guilty of the larceny count and that he broke and entered unit 10 armed with a knife so as to be guilty of the aggravated break and enter offence.  
120The identification evidence was overwhelmingly that it was the appellant who entered unit 10.  The appellant was found in the vicinity of the apartments in possession of items stolen from the manager's office (other than the keys which had been left in the door of unit 10).  That evidence, combined with the fact that the intruder gained entry to unit 10 with a key, a key to unit 10 had been stolen from the manager's office and he was identified as the intruder in unit 10 pointed overwhelmingly to his having broken into the manager's office.  The fact that there was some evidence, although I would indicate not much, that showed he was still at the house where he was staying at the time of the offences, is not sufficient to raise a doubt that he committed the larceny offence. 
121That leaves the question whether the jury must have had a doubt as to whether the appellant had a knife, that being the matter of aggravation in respect of count 2.  As I have indicated, RF gave consistent and contemporaneous evidence that the intruder in the unit had a knife.  She described it, in consistent terms, on more than one occasion, including in cross-examination.  She was never challenged directly that the intruder did not have a knife.  
122The differences in RF's evidence about either her father or herself getting a knife from the kitchen to assess the size of the knife and her father's denial that he had done so, did not require the conclusion that the appellant was not in possession of a knife when he entered the unit.  Inconsistencies in the evidence of a witness, including the principal witness, or differences in the evidence given by witnesses does not compel a conclusion that the essential aspects of the witness' evidence are not to be believed.  As was explained in Libke, the fact that there is some evidence contrary to the evidence which is relied upon by the Crown to establish guilt does ""not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt"".   
123Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied ""upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"" that the appellant was guilty of the larceny offence and the aggravated break and enter offence:  see M at 493.  
124I would dismiss ground 2 of the appeal. 
Proposed orders
125I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
126JOHNSON J:  I agree with the judgment of Beazley P and the order proposed by her Honour.  With respect to Ground 2, having made an independent assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of the offences for which he stood trial.
127PRICE J:  Having myself assessed the whole of the evidence, I agree with Beazley P that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of each of the offences for which he stood trial. I agree with the President's reasons and the orders that are proposed.

2762826,"TAMMER-SPENCE, Jacob v R [2013] NSWCCA 297","Judgment

1LATHAM J: I agree with Rothman J.

2ROTHMAN J: Jacob Tammer-Spence (the Applicant) pleaded guilty to a number of offences: three counts of robbery (s 94, Crimes Act 1900); and four counts of armed robbery (s 97(1), Crimes Act). Further offences were notified on a Form 1, being one offence of detain with intent to obtain an advantage (s 86(1), Crimes Act), four offences of obtain property by deception (s 192E(1)(a), Crimes Act), and one offence of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence (s 114(1)(a), Crimes Act).

3The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence of six years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months. The Applicant seeks leave to appeal to the Court from the sentence imposed, and if the Court were to grant leave, seeks to have the Court set aside the sentence and impose a lesser sentence.

4The Applicant raises three grounds of appeal:

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of deterrence. It ought not to have been a material factor in the sentencing of the Applicant.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred by concluding that the Applicant, a ""markedly disturbed young man"", ought to have taken greater responsibility in seeking help. The failure to seek help ought not have been held against the Applicant.

Ground 3: The aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive. 

Summary of Facts

5The Applicant was born on 5 May 1993 and was 18 years of age at the time of the offences. Generally, the offences occurred in the following way. The Applicant attended the toilets at Town Hall Station and indicated to men attending the toilets that he was available for sexual acts. If the person indicated that he would like to engage in sexual acts, the Applicant would lead the victim to a more private location.

6When the Applicant and victim were at the more private locations at which the offences were to occur, the victim would be robbed. On some occasions there would be sexual activity before the robbery.

7Count 1 relates to 12 October 2011, on which occasion the Applicant led the victim to a car park toilet, demanded money and raised his fists in a threatening manner. He robbed the victim of $US828, mobile phones and $AUD5.

8Count 2 relates to 19 October 2011. On this occasion, the Applicant approached the victim at the urinal, told the victim that he, the Applicant, was taking the victim's bag and demanded the victim's watch and rings. The Applicant hit the victim in the head with the Applicant's skateboard, causing a cut, and demanded the victim's phone, which was provided.

9The conduct giving rise to Count 3 occurred on 28 October 2011. This time, the Applicant led the victim to the car park toilet, engaged in sexual activity, demanded money, produced a pocket knife, grabbed the victim around the neck and held the knife to the victim's face.

10On 3 November 2011, the events that gave rise to Count 4 occurred. The Applicant approached the victim from behind, held a knife to the victim's back, took his wallet and phone and demanded, on threat of attending the victim's address and killing his dog, that the victim follow him. The offence of detain for advantage, notified on the Form 1, arises from this conduct. The victim followed the Applicant for some time.

11The conduct giving rise to Count 5 occurred on 14 November 2011. The Applicant led the victim to a toilet where they participated in consensual sexual activities. The Applicant then produced a knife, grabbed the victim's neck, held the knife 20cm from the victim's face and demanded his phone and wallet. The Applicant then utilised the victim's credit card to effect four purchases, amounting to $174.43, which latter conduct has given rise to offences of obtain property by deception that are part of the Form 1 notice.

12Count 6 occurred on 21 November 2011. The Applicant and victim engaged in sexual activity in the car park toilet. The Applicant again produced a knife and this time held it to the victim's stomach area. He took the victim's phone and debit card and demanded to know the PIN. He then used the card to make two withdrawals totalling $60, giving rise to the second of the Form 1, obtain by deception, charges.

13Count 7 relates to conduct on 22 November 2011.The Applicant led the victim to toilets at the MLC Centre, engaged in sexual activity, went with the victim to another toilet in the same building and, finally, to the toilet outside St James' Station. In the cubicle at St James, the Applicant grabbed the victim's backpack and removed an iPhone and $70. The victim agreed to give the Applicant more money in return for his iPhone, whereupon they proceeded to three separate ATMs and withdrew $200, which the victim gave to the Applicant.

14Lastly, the final offence notified on the Form 1 (being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely robbery) occurred when, after a surveillance operation mounted to locate and arrest the Applicant, police arrested him and, on searching him, found a knife in his possession similar to the knife or knives used in the earlier offences.

15The foregoing summary is sufficient for the appeal and indicates the level of criminal conduct charged and the kind of conduct to which the Form 1 offences relate.

Subjective Circumstances

16The Applicant was 19 years of age when sentenced and 18 at the time of the offences. He had a troubled childhood and suffers psychiatric issues.

17At the age of 12, the Applicant was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and at the age of 14 was sexually assaulted (anal intercourse) by an unknown person. The assault continues to cause him significant distress, but he has undertaken no psychological counselling in relation to the incident.

18The Applicant has a criminal record, principally in the Children's Court, involving a number of control orders, but his history does not involve offences of the kind for which he was sentenced.

19Study for the Applicant's School Certificate occurred while in custody with Juvenile Justice in 2008. Prior to that his schooling was marked and marred, interrupted because of behavioural issues.

20At the age of 11 the Applicant commenced smoking cannabis and used methyl amphetamines, ""ice"" and heroin from 14 years of age. The Applicant spent a few days in a mental health ward in 2011, after attempting suicide.

21The sentencing judge concluded that the Applicant ""was a markedly disturbed young man"" largely as a result of his use of methyl amphetamines (ice). Further, the sentencing judge took the view that the Applicant would ""need considerable psychological and drug counselling"" and treatment.

22The Applicant's drug addiction commenced at a time when the Applicant was unable ""to make reasoned choices and without a proper understanding of the long-term consequences for him of such drug addiction"" (Remarks on Sentence at p 11.4).

23Tendered on sentence, and relied on by the Applicant, were reports of Dr Katie Seidler (Psychologist) and Dr Olav Nielssen (Psychiatrist). The Applicant's parents separated when he was 18 months old, after which he remained in the care of his mother. His parents were not violent towards him and he has maintained a relationship with his father and formed a relationship with his stepmother and half-brothers and stepsisters.

24On the other hand, he has a poor relationship with his stepfather (his mother having remarried when he was 8 years old) who has been violent towards him and caused him to start ""running away"" at about 12 years of age, when he stayed with friends or his father. The Applicant plans to move in with his father on release from prison.

25Dr Nielssen described the Applicant as presenting:

""... as a strongly built man of part Afro Caribbean heritage who was articulate and fluent in his responses. His emotional responses were appropriate to the content of his speech and he did not appear to be especially depressed. He spoke with a broad Australian accent and made liberal use of profanity. He was quick to respond and had a good command of detail ...""

26Dr Nielssen diagnosed the Applicant as having:

""1. Substance dependence and abuse disorder, in remission;

2. Conduct disorder.""

27The diagnosis of drug dependence was described as being in remission as a result of the Applicant's detention and Dr Nielssen was of the view that the Applicant did not have a major psychiatric disorder.

28Notwithstanding that view and Dr Nielssen's opinion that the Applicant does not require specific psychiatric treatment, the sentencing judge found special circumstances based on the need for counselling in the community on release to aid rehabilitation, as well as the need to accumulate the sentences.

29The offences, while occurring in the context of sexual relations, are not sex offences. The sex involved seems always to have been consensual. This was noted by the sentencing judge, who also allowed a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas. It is unnecessary to set out at this point each of the indicative sentences, which, as has been stated, were not individually imposed.

Ground 1: The undue significance of deterrence in the sentence

30The primary issue raised in the application for leave to appeal (and appeal) is as summarised in full terms of the ground, set out at [4] above. 

31Essentially the Applicant submits that the need for deterrence does not apply in the usual way to him because, at the time of the offences, on his Honour's finding, the Applicant was a ""markedly disturbed young man"", namely, because of his psychiatric/mental condition, his youth and his drug addiction. 

32The principles of sentencing are well known and have been re-stated a number of times. The purposes of sentencing are set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in the following terms:

""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""

33The High Court described those purposes in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 and said:

""The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions."" (Veen (No 2) at [13] per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ.)

34Sentencing is a discretionary exercise that involves ""a synthesis of competing features which attempts to translate the complexity of the human condition and human behaviour to the mathematics of units of punishment usually expressed in time or money"": Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at [24].

35Further, the sentencing exercise is not mathematical. Rather it is fundamentally intuitive, for which there is no one correct result: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. The sentencer is required to take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) and appeal courts are required to give a sentencing judge as much flexibility as is consonant with consistency of approach and accords with the statutory regime: Markarian v The Queen at [27], and the cases cited therein. Consistency is achieved by the proper application of principle: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [18], [19]. 

36In sentencing young offenders (or persons with a mental illness), the sentencing principles make clear that retribution may be of less significance and considerations of rehabilitation may be of more significance. Further, even in relation to retribution, the youth of an offender may be a mitigating factor: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; (2010) 201 A Crim R 379 at [4] per Hodgson JA, with whom I agreed; KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [22]-[26]. 

37While offenders under 18 years of age are sentenced under a different regime (Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987), youth may not reach emotional maturity or impulse control until early to mid twenties: BP v R at [5] per Hodgson JA; R v Slade [2005] NZCA 19; (2005) 2 NZLR 526 at [43]; R v Elliott [2006] NSWCCA 305; (2006) 68 NSWLR 1 at [127] per D. Kirby J; R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451. Age, and the principles associated with sentencing youth, may be a factor when sentencing a 19 year old, as here, or, depending on maturity, even a 21 year old. Despite the fact that, here, the offences in question do not reflect aspects of immaturity, the Applicant may not have had the maturity to understand fully the consequences of his actions and to control his conduct accordingly. 

38The same approach (sometimes cumulatively) applies to offenders suffering a mental disability: R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at [50], [57], per Howie J. In R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92; (2004) 145 A Crim R 434 at [28], the Court (Dunford J, Studdert and James JJ agreeing) said:

""[28] It is true that in the case of young offenders, there is generally greater emphasis given to rehabilitation and less to deterrence than in the case of adult offenders, but that depends in part on the age of the young person and the circumstances of the offence; and there comes a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a young offender, particularly if a crime of violence, is so great that the special attention normally given to rehabilitation in the case of young offenders must give way, and greater emphasis given to punishment and deterrence. The relevant principle was summarised in the joint judgment of this Court in R v AEM Snr and Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97]- [98] as follows: 

'It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation.... However, important as that principle is, it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment nor, in circumstances where young offenders conduct themselves in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society.'

and their Honours quoted what had been said by Lee AJ in R v Nichols (1991) 57 A Crim R 391 at 395 as follows: 

'However there is a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a man of 19, even though a young man, is of such a nature is so great, that the principle must, in the public interest, give way.'

[29] See also R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135, R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]- [11], R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 469, R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37, 124 A Crim R 451 at [24].

[30] ... Growth from child to adult is a gradual process and for general sentencing purposes, there is no significant difference between a person shortly under 18 years and a person shortly over that age ....""

39None of the foregoing statements of principle suggests that deterrence has no role to play, only that rehabilitation is more significant, and retribution and deterrence less significant, than would otherwise be the case. 

40The Applicant relies on a passage in the Remarks on Sentence (at p 10) in which his Honour said:

""The disinhibiting moral effect of ice on young people of his age is a disturbing aspect of many offences being seen now by this Court. As such, there needs to be a need for deterrence in that whilst drug use, per se, may be morally blameless in an individual, where such use leads to violent anti-social behaviour the individual has a responsibility to seek help and not just to continue down a path of taking no responsibility for his or her actions..."" [as per Applicant's Written Submissions at [7] on p 3.] [Emphasis added by Applicant].

41First, I note the use of the indefinite article, ""a"", without reference to a descriptor such as ""significant"". In my view, his Honour was simply stating that deterrence was a factor in considering the sentence to be imposed, but he declined to describe it as ""important"" or ""significant"". 

42Further, his Honour was entitled to suggest that, where drug use has led to violent anti-social behaviour, there was ""a responsibility"" to seek help, rather than continuing on a path ""of taking no responsibility"". 

43The extract does not suggest that deterrence had a significant impact or greater weight than rehabilitation. Moreover the Applicant's submission pays insufficient attention to the unsuccessful attempts to support the Applicant with appropriate treatment in order to effect rehabilitation. The Applicant consistently refused to undertake community rehabilitation that was offered to him and continued to express that view before the sentencing judge.

44The foregoing presented the sentencing judge with a dilemma. If rehabilitation were to be given greater significance by his Honour, as may have been suggested by the Applicant's youth and troubled background, but the Applicant refused to undertake rehabilitation programmes in the community (which programmes had been offered in the past), how does the judge give effect to the principle?

45The judge noted (ROS 7.9 and following) that the Applicant was unwilling to accept intervention at present, including talking about personal problems, psychometric assessment and the like. Further, the Applicant displayed little or no insight into his problems. It was after these references that his Honour remarked in the manner extracted and about which complaint is made on appeal. 

46Moreover, the Applicant's submission pays no regard to any rehabilitation that may occur (or may have occurred) while in prison. The evidence before his Honour (and this Court) was that, at the time of sentencing the Applicant was drug-free, seemingly for the first time since he was 11 years of age, because of the restrictions in prison. 

47I take for granted that rehabilitation in the community is preferable to attempts at rehabilitation (even where successful) within the prison system, but that choice was not before his Honour. The only choice apparent from the Applicant's subjective case was either attempts at rehabilitation in prison or no rehabilitation at all. 

48His Honour took account of the need for rehabilitation in the community in finding special circumstances and fixing a much shorter non-parole period than the statute otherwise prescribes. His Honour remarked on the need for community-based ""psychological and drug counselling"", presumably in the expectation that initial custodial counselling would overcome the Applicant's previously displayed resistance to community psychological and drug treatment. 

49It is clear from both the complete Remarks on Sentence and the nature and structure of the sentence that his Honour had the Applicant's youth and the need for rehabilitation uppermost in the considerations relevant to the sentence to be imposed. However, his Honour did not expressly refer to the principles associated with the significance of rehabilitation and the lesser weight for deterrence in young offenders.

50Ultimately, given the foregoing, whether error has occurred in weighing the relative significance of deterrence, if any, and rehabilitation will depend to a large degree on the sentence imposed.

Ground 2: Error in concluding that the Applicant ought to have taken greater responsibility

51To some degree the issues associated with this ground of appeal have been dealt with while dealing with Ground 1.

52The Applicant submits that his history explained both his addiction and his failure to seek help. The Applicant supports the foregoing proposition with the sentencing judge's conclusion that the Applicant's drug addiction commenced at a time when the Applicant was unable to make reasoned choices (ROS 11.4).

53As has been expressed in the discussion relating to Ground 1, his Honour expressly acknowledged the Applicant's troubled history, his psychiatric issues and the fact that his drug addiction occurred at a time when the age of the Applicant prevented reasoned choices. In other words, his Honour made clear that the Applicant was ""morally blameless"" in relation to his addiction.

54His Honour's comments as to responsibility must be understood in that context. The sentencing judge was: firstly, expressing a general view without ascribing to it a particular significance in the sentence to be imposed; and, secondly, was referring, not to the circumstances of the Applicant's addiction, but, rather, to the fact that the Applicant realised at the time of the offences that his conduct was morally and legally wrong, had the opportunity to undertake programmes to deal with his issues, yet failed (or, more accurately, refused) to utilise those opportunities. 

55In my view, the Applicant, in this ground, is taking the remarks of his Honour out of context and giving them a significance that is not apparent from his Honour's Remarks on Sentence.

Ground 3: Manifest Excess

56Sentencing is an exercise of intuitive synthesis of all of the material before the sentencer in order to serve purposes that often pull in different directions: s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; Veen v The Queen (No 2); Markarian v The Queen; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.

57As earlier stated, a sentencing judge must, in fixing an appropriate sentence, be given such flexibility as is consonant with the legislative scheme and the principles of sentencing: Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616; Markarian v The Queen. There is no one correct sentence.

58Yet, this Court examines a sentence, bearing in mind the foregoing, to ensure that there is not manifest error, namely, error manifest from the outcome, even though a party cannot identify an error of law or fact: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499.

59In so doing, the Court must examine the sentence imposed to ensure it is a sentence capable of being imposed on the offender for the offence, i.e. bearing in mind both objective and subjective circumstances relevant to the offence and the offender. Often this is expressed by the shorthand enquiry: Is the sentence within range? The shorthand expression is appropriate only if it is understood to include the ""range"" for this offence, being the actual conduct giving rise to the offence, the circumstances in which it was committed, and the subjective circumstances of the offender (both relevant to the commission of the offence and more generally).

60The sentence that is subject to appeal is, as has been stated, an aggregate sentence of six years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years and six months' imprisonment. There were seven offences for which the Applicant was to be sentenced.

61Each of the three counts of robbery (contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act) involves an offence with a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 14 years. Each of the four counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon (contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act) carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment. None of the offences has a prescribed standard non-parole period.

62Before imposing the aggregate sentence, his Honour, as was required, expressed an indicative sentence for each offence. For present purposes, there is little relevance in which sentence relates to which of the offences and no single indicative sentence is impugned.

63The robbery offences involved two sentences of 3 years' imprisonment and one sentence of 3 years and 9 months' imprisonment, being the sentence for which an offence notified under Form1 was relevant. The robbery with offensive weapon sentences involved three sentences of 4 years' imprisonment (two of which include Form 1 offences) and one sentence of imprisonment for 4 years and 9 months (also involving a Form 1 offence).

64None of the indicative sentences is outside the range or manifestly excessive. Each reflects an appropriate regard for the strong subjective circumstances suffered by the Applicant.

65The principles of totality would prevent all of the foregoing indicative sentences being fully accumulated. Nevertheless, given the number and seriousness of the offences, and the fact that each involves a separate criminal act and intent, albeit during a short criminal spree, some accumulation is warranted. The longest sentence is 4 years and 9 months; there are six other offences for which additional imprisonment has been imposed of a total of 1 year and 3 months.

66Sentences are not calculated mathematically. Rather, it is an intuitive process. Nevertheless, given that there are seven offences, the heaviest of which is 4 years and 9 months, the seriousness of the offences and the vulnerability of the victims, this aggregate sentence is not outside the range available to the sentencing judge, even with the strong subjective factors of the Applicant and the lesser weight to be given to retribution and deterrence as against rehabilitation.

67I do not consider the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive and I do not consider that a lesser sentence is warranted.

68I propose that the Court makes the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal sentence granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

69DAVIES J: I agree with Rothman J.

		28 November 2013",2013-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762829,Alpha v R [2013] NSWCCA 292,"Judgment1LEEMING JA: I agree with Bellew J's reasons for dismissing this application.  In particular, I agree with his Honour that the approach stated by this Court in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [53] is to be applied to all cases in which an extension of time is sought.  That approach requires regard to be had to all relevant factors:  the extent of and explanation for the delay, the interests of the community and the victim, and also whether substantial injustice would result if the extension were refused.  Some of those considerations reflect the principle of finality considered in detail in Abdul.  However, as Basten JA pointed out in Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383 at [42] and [46]-[47], the principle of finality is a concept which operates at a high level of generality, and is not to be applied in isolation, but rather falls to be assessed in criminal appeals in light of the high value placed on fair procedure and correct outcome.
2It follows that even though the delay by the applicant is significant, and in large measure unsatisfactorily explained, it remains necessary to examine the merits of the proposed appeal.  However, that examination can, and in many or most cases should, be conducted in a ""more summary fashion"" than would ordinarily be the case on the hearing of an appeal.  That must be so; it cannot be the case that the same level of curial scrutiny is required in order to determine an application for leave as is required by an appeal.  Otherwise the considerations favouring bringing litigation to an end would be disregarded, and the time limits imposed by the Legislature would become entirely otiose. 
3BELLEW J: Following a lengthy trial in the District Court, the applicant (whose identity is protected by a suppression order and who has been referred to in these proceedings as ""Alpha"") was found guilty of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug into Australia, contrary to ss. 11.5(1) and 307.1 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (""the Code"").   
4The border controlled drug was 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine also known as MDMA or ""ecstasy"".  Pursuant to s. 314.1 of the Code the commercial quantity of MDMA is 500 grams.    The quantity of pure MDMA which was imported was 30.82 kilograms.  The maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment.
5The applicant was also charged with four other offences following a search of his residential premises at the time of his arrest.  Those offences were as follows:  
(i)possess unlicensed pistol (Firearms Act 1996 s. 7(1));
(ii)possess ammunition without licence (Firearms Act 1996 s. 65);
(iii)fail to keep firearms safely (Firearms Act 1996 s. 39); and
(iv)possess prohibited weapon, namely a ballistic vest (Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 s. 7(1)).
6In respect of the conspiracy charge, the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Lakatos to a total term of imprisonment of 15 years and 6 months commencing on 7 January 2009 and expiring on 6 July 2024.  A non-parole period of 10 years and 4 months was imposed.  The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 6 May 2019.
7In respect of the additional charges his Honour imposed the following penalties:
(i)possess unlicensed pistol: fixed term of 18 months imprisonment;
(ii)possess ammunition without a licence: a fine of $500.00;
(iii)fail to keep firearms safely: fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months;
(iv)possess prohibited weapon: imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months.
8Adopting a concession made by the Crown, his Honour ordered that the sentences imposed in (i), (iii) and (iv) above be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of the conspiracy count.  The applicant's offending in respect of those matters in (i), (iii) and (iv) was quite separate and distinct from his offending in respect of the conspiracy.  Although it is not a matter which is material to the determination of the present application, the Crown's concession was, in my view, generous to say the least.      
9The applicant stood trial with a number of other co-conspirators, namely Terrence John McCraw (""McCraw""), Dalibor Pasinovic (""Pasinovic"") James Lattouf (""Lattouf"") and Ronald Stanley (""Stanley"").  McCraw and Lattouf were also found guilty by the jury of the conspiracy count.  The jury could not reach a decision in respect of Stanley and the Director of Public Prosecutions ultimately decided not to proceed any further against him.  Another named co-conspirator (who did not go to trial) was Renato Picardi (""Picardi"").
10Pasinovic originally pleaded not guilty and gave evidence in his defence at the trial.  Following cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, he was re-arraigned and entered a plea of guilty.  The trial judge refused a subsequent application made on behalf of the applicant, McCraw and Lattouf that the jury be discharged.  
THE APPLICATION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME11Having been sentenced on 9 April 2010 the applicant requires a substantial extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal.  His application for an extension of time is supported by an affidavit of his solicitor, Angelo Bilias, field on 23 July 2013 which was read without objection.  
12The explanation (such as it is) for the delay is contained in paragraph 5 of that affidavit.  Because of the significance of this issue, it is appropriate that the contents of that paragraph be set out in full:  
""[5] My explanation for the delay is as follows:
(a) There was a delay associated with pursuing this appeal as there were four co-offenders to be sentenced and each of the co-offenders had staggered sentencing procedures before the same sentencing judge.
(b) The last of the co-offenders was sentenced in June 2010.
(c) The applicant received a sentence of 26 years as a head sentence prior to a discount of 40% for assistance leaving him a sentence of 15 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years and 4 months.  
(d) The brief of evidence in this matter relating to the trial was extensive and involved 9 lever arch folders and a trial transcript exceeds (sic) 3,500 pages.  The length of the trial was 59 days.
(e) I approached a number of barristers after Alpha's sentence in the proceeding as to whether they would be willing to prepare a merit advice in relation to providing a merit advice (sic) conviction and/or sentence.  Firstly, the Public Defenders did not accept the matter.  Further as the matter was funded by legal aid and required a large amount of material to be read a number of barristers which (sic) I approached were not available at the time.  Subsequently Mr Peter Lowe of counsel accepted the brief on (sic) or about July 2010.(f) Our instructions were initially to pursue both a conviction and a sentence appeal.  I asked Mr Lowe if he was prepared to give a merit advice in relation to this matter.  Mr Lowe has advised me and I verily believe that there was a significant delay in preparing the merit advice because of the requirement of reading the voluminous material and because during the course of reading the material he vacillated on the essential issue whether the course of events during the trial warranted a conviction appeal been (sic) pursued.  During the course of the (sic) Alpha's trial one of the co-accused indicated to the jury whilst giving evidence that he was guilty and that he had been threatened.  All co-offenders subsequently made an application through their counsel to discharge the jury which was rejected by the trial judge.  
(g) Ultimately Mr Lowe provided a merit advice to the effect that a conviction appeal lacks sufficient merit, but he identified an appeal against the sentence imposed on the basis of parity considerations, notwithstanding this court's decision in McCraw v R [2011] NSWCCA 162.
(h) The applicant prays leave to appeal his sentence out of time and that (sic) an order nunc pro tunc extending the period of which the notice of appeal has effect.""
13In the course of the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the applicant explained that the word ""ultimately"" at the commencement of paragraph 5(g) of the affidavit should be read as meaning ""shortly before the proceedings were commenced in this Court"".  In other words, having been briefed in the matter in July 2010, counsel did not provide advice until some 3 years later.  
14In Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247, in the context of an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal on the basis of a so called ""Muldrock error"" (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120) this Court (Hoeben CJ at CL, Johnson and Bellew JJ), having reviewed the relevant authorities, said (at [53]):
""Accordingly, when considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result. This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time.""
15That approach is not confined to applications for extension of time based upon ""Muldrock error"".  Rather, it is one which is to be adopted in all cases in which an extension of time is sought in order to bring an appeal, or an application for leave to appeal, in this Court.  Adopting that approach, and taking into account the matters which the Court in Abdul identified as being relevant, the present application for an extension of time is beset with a number of difficulties.     
16Firstly, a period of more than 3½ years has elapsed since the applicant was sentenced.  It follows that on any view, the delay in bringing the application is substantial.
17Secondly, and again bearing in mind the length of the delay, granting the application for an extension of time would offend the principle of finality.
18Thirdly, and fundamentally, the delay is not adequately explained.  In Winter v R [2013] NSWCCA 231, with the concurrence of Hoeben CJ at CL and Barr AJ, I said (at [26]) that in any case where an extension of time is sought, and particularly where the delay is extensive, there is an onus placed upon an applicant to adduce evidence which fully explains that delay.  I observed, in particular, that such explanation must necessarily incorporate a clear articulation of the steps taken to prosecute the appeal, and a comprehensive explanation for any periods of apparent inactivity.  In my view, the affidavit of Mr Bilias falls substantially short of meeting these requirements.    
19One of the matters relied upon to explain the delay is that the last of the co-offenders was sentenced in June 2010.  Even accepting that there was a necessity to await the outcome of other sentence proceedings, all of those proceedings were concluded more than three years ago.  Moreover, the explanation for the delay between the finalisation of those proceedings in June 2010, and the filing of the notice in July 2013, is completely inadequate for a number of reasons.    
20Firstly, the applicant relies upon the fact that the trial was a lengthy one, requiring counsel to read a large brief of evidence and a significant amount of transcript.  Reliance on those matters completely ignores the fact that counsel briefed to provide advice was the same counsel who appeared at the trial.  This is not a case in which counsel who was completely unfamiliar with the matter was retained to advise.  
21Secondly, the particular issue identified by Mr Bilias in paragraph 5(f) of his affidavit, about which counsel was said to have been vacillating and which is said to have contributed to the delay, concerned the trial judge's refusal of the application to discharge the jury following the re-arraignment of Pasinovic.  That issue was, to say the least, a narrow one.  
22Thirdly, even if it is accepted that there was a necessity for counsel to consider that issue, that does not explain a delay of 3 years in the provision of advice.   This is particularly so where counsel had appeared at the trial and would necessarily have been fully appraised of the issue about which he was said to be vacillating.  
23In my view, all of these matters tend very much against granting an extension of time.  However as noted in Abdul, one of the relevant considerations when determining an application to extend time is whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  This inevitably requires an assessment of the merits of the proposed appeal.  However, as held in Abdul (at [53]) such assessment can be carried out in a more summary fashion than would be the case had the application for leave to appeal been brought within the prescribed period of time.


THE FACTS24There was no challenge to the facts of the conspiracy as found by the sentencing judge.  Those facts may be summarised as follows.  
25On 25 June 2007, a European based vessel called ""The Sophie"" departed from the port of Antwerp in Belgium.  Following its departure, approximately 40 kilograms of crystalline material containing 30.822 kilograms of pure ecstasy were brought aboard and came into the custody and safe keeping of Pasinovic.  The estimated value of the drug once landed in Australia was between $4.4 million and $18.5 million, depending upon the form in which it was ultimately sold.
26Between 10 July 2007 and 19 August 2007 Pasinovic communicated with a number of persons who were in possession of mobile telephones linked to telecommunication networks in The Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, Spain, Serbia and Montenegro.  He was also in possession of four sim cards which were linked to mobile telephone networks based in Italy, Spain and Serbia.  
27The Patrick Stevedoring Company (""Patricks"") carried on business as stevedore from a container terminal at Port Botany.  It (or its predecessor) had employed McCraw as a waterside worker for approximately 30 years.  Between 17 July and 19 August 2007 McCraw, Lattouf and Picardi, along with another unindicted co-conspirator, communicated repeatedly with each other by telephone.  For the purposes of doing so, each of them (along with the applicant) used a mobile telephone in a fictitious name.    
28On 3 August 2007 McCraw telephoned the Sydney office of the Mediterranean Shipping Company to ascertain the anticipated arrival date of The Sophie.  He had, in the preceding weeks, made inquiries of various personnel at Patricks about the level of security which was in place in and around the Port Botany terminal, and the adjoining car park.  When it became known that The Sophie would berth at the Patricks terminal on 9 August 2007, McCraw elected to work on that day despite it being his rostered day off.  
29Between 7 August 2007 and 9 August 2007 the applicant and Pasinovic communicated on 47 occasions, mostly by text message.    
30On 8 August 2007 McCraw requested the management of Patricks to roster his team on the evening shift, that being the shift during which The Sophie would be unloaded.  On the following morning, 9 August, McCraw sought permission from his superiors to use the crane located at the point where The Sophie was to be berthed.  These arrangements were put in place by McCraw so as to ensure that he would be able to unload the drugs being carried on board The Sophie.    
31On the morning of 9 August 2007 Lattouf met Picardi at Picardi's residence in Burwood.  They then drove to a service station at Revesby where they met with McCraw for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before returning to Picardi's residence.
32McCraw entered the Patricks terminal shortly after 11.00 am on the morning of 9 August, well in advance of his rostered start time.  Stanley (who, like McCraw, was working on his rostered day off) arrived at the terminal at 12.56 pm, which was similarly well ahead of his rostered start time.  
33At about 2:00pm McCraw, Stanley and others commenced to unload The Sophie.  On the same afternoon, the applicant met with Picardi and Lattouf at Picardi's residence.  The applicant and Picardi were observed by police talking with each other and making telephone calls.  In the course of that meeting the applicant contacted Pasinovic and arranged to meet with him.   
34At about 3:46pm on that same afternoon Lattouf and the applicant departed Picardi's residence.  Lattouf drove to a hotel at Banksmeadow where he met with McCraw at about 5:09pm, McCraw having driven to that location from the Patricks terminal during a rostered meal break.  Stanley arrived at the same hotel at 5:44pm and joined the meeting.
35Pasinovic and the applicant met at a hotel at 5:06pm where the applicant handed Pasinovic a bag containing €22,500.00 and AUD$21,700.00.  The applicant drove Pasinovic back to the terminal, following which Pasinovic re-boarded The Sophie.  The applicant and Pasinovic remained in contact during that evening.
36At about 6:10pm McCraw and Lattouf left the meeting in Banksmeadow in their own vehicles and drove to the car park adjacent to the Patricks terminal.  McCraw used his security card to allow Lattouf to enter the car park and their respective vehicles were parked side by side.  McCraw returned to work and left Lattouf in his car.  Stanley returned at about 6.20pm and parked on the other side of Lattouf's vehicle before returning to work.  There was subsequent telephone contact between McCraw and Picardi.    
37At about 9:01pm McCraw telephoned Lattouf, before directing, at about 9.30 pm, that the unloading of The Sophie should cease.  McCraw telephoned Lattouf again at 9:38pm.  
38McCraw and Stanley left the Patricks terminal at about 9.53 pm, each carrying a bag containing 20 kilograms of ecstasy which had been unloaded from The Sophie.  They walked to the car park, where Lattouf had remained, and loaded the two bags into the rear of Lattouf's vehicle.  McCraw, Stanley and Lattouf then drove from the car park in their respective vehicles and were arrested a short time later.  Pasinovic was arrested on board The Sophie and was found with money concealed in his clothing.
39The applicant was not arrested until 28 March 2008.  In the course of the search of his home police located a Smith and Wesson 0.22 calibre pistol with an attached silencer, a quantity of ammunition, and a ballistic vest.  THE APPLICANT'S ROLE40The sentencing judge made a number of findings in relation to the applicant's role.  But for one matter, those findings were not challenged by the applicant.
41His Honour concluded (at ROS 12) that the applicant was knowingly involved in the conspiracy from at least 3 August 2007 before stating (at ROS 13):
...The importation was a sophisticated international scheme involving many persons in many countries and drugs of a significant quantity and value. It required much careful planning and financial outlay. Unlike drug couriers carrying smaller quantities of drugs in or on their person as to which it may be more likely to accept that they were not told the full story, where the risk of detection and confiscation of drugs involves a lesser financial loss for the principals of the scheme, detection in the present case could involve a loss of millions of dollars, between 5 and 18 so the evidence bears out. 
That being so, in my view it is unlikely that a person in the (applicant's) position would be co-opted in the short period immediately before the drugs landed in this country and without some knowledge of the likely value of the drugs.
42His Honour continued (at ROS 13-14):
In my opinion, absent evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to take an artificial view of the surveillance evidence which appears to depict (the applicant) as the person who deals with co-conspirator, Mr Pasinovic. The onus of course is upon (the applicant) to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that he was a lower participant in the hierarchy in the drug conspiracy than the evidence may indicate. He has not given or adduced any evidence of that kind, and I am unable to so find.
Accordingly, I accept the submissions of the Crown...that (the applicant) held an important and key high level organisational role in this conspiracy, which was typified by his maintaining a distance from the physical process of importing the drug and was marked by the sophistication of the offence and the high degree of planning.  In my view, a commonsense and practical view of the entire evidence cannot help but disclose that particular conclusion.  Similarly, the fact that the (applicant) was entrusted to pay Mr Pasinovic a significant sum, in excess of AUD$50,000.00, supports this conclusion.43His Honour found that the applicant was at the top of the hierarchy of the known criminal co-conspirators, with Pasinovic and McCraw forming what he described as ""the second tier"" (at ROS 15):
The Crown submits that the hierarchy of the known criminal co-conspirators that were the subject of the trial before me are as follows: firstly, Alpha is at the top of those known. The Crown submits at para. 16, that he is an important, key, high level organisational person typified by maintaining a distance from physical process and by the sophisticated nature of the offence and the high degree of planning.  In the second tier the Crown argues are Mr Pasinovic and Mr McCraw.  However, they also occupied an essential and crucial role.  And at the bottom of the gradation was Mr Lattouf who, the Crown argues, had at least a very significant role, but lesser roles to the two other categories.  In my view, having considered very carefully, the Crown's submission, it is one which is warranted on the material (emphasis added).    
44In assessing the applicant's role, his Honour said (at ROS 16):
I take into account the following matters so far as the role of (the applicant): firstly, the supporting contextual matters of the significant weight of the drug involved, which is 61 times the commercial threshold for MDMA. I also take into account the value of the drug, and the fact that Mr Pasinovic was paid in excess of $57,000.00. I am of the view that these are matters which lead to the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt, that (the applicant) knew that he was dealing with a substantial quantity of drugs. There is no evidence that he was paid for any part he had in the conspiracy, but I infer from the commercial nature of the conspiracy, its sophistication and international nature, and the amounts paid to a co-conspirator, that (the applicant) was involved for financial gain, in all probability for an amount greater than that received by the co-conspirator, Mr Pasinovic given his higher status in this criminal conspiracy. In my opinion, a realistic view of the surrounding circumstances offers no other reasonable conclusion.
45Finally, his Honour said (at ROS 23):
I consider in relation to those of the co-conspirators who were parties to the conspiracy in the trial conducted before me and who were found guilty, that (the applicant) is at the top of the level of hierarchy. 
I do not accept, that he is by any means the major principal. On all of what has been led before me I remain quietly convinced that the major players if named, have not been brought to justice and certainly many major players have not been named and remain perhaps unknown (emphasis added).
46In sentencing the applicant, his Honour concluded that an appropriate starting point was a term of 26 years imprisonment.  He also concluded that the applicant was entitled to a reduction of 40% on account of his assistance to the authorities.
47The one issue which is raised by the applicant in respect of his Honour's findings as to his role arises from the references at ROS 15 (at [42] above) and ROS 23 (at [44] above) to the effect that the applicant was at the top level of the hierarchy.  I have dealt with that issue further below.  
THE SENTENCES IMPOSED ON OTHER CO-CONSPIRATORS48Because of the grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant, it is necessary to make reference to the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders who stood trial, and the findings made by his Honour about their respective roles.
Pasinovic 49His Honour rejected a submission that Pasinovic was involved in the conspiracy within a narrow time frame and that his role was limited to the supervision of the handover of the drugs.  His Honour also rejected a submission that Pasinovic did not see or handle the drugs, and that he did not know the quantity.  Ultimately his Honour concluded (at ROS 14):
(Counsel) submitted that I should find that Mr Pasinovic was a courier or a functionary who had an important role but (was) not directing the operations. In my view that is an accurate assessment of his part in it. That proposition does not make what he did any less important in what occurred, but I certainly do not see any evidence on which I could act that he had any part in directing any of the operations which were involved.
50His Honour continued (at ROS 17 - 18):
A significant matter in determining the level of criminality of a person in such an offence is the role that the offender has played in the criminal conspiracy. The Crown has submitted so far as all those who are convicted after trial were concerned, that the apex of criminality lay with (Alpha). They have described his role as important and key high level organisational level. On the second tier, the Crown has contended, lay Mr Pasinovic and Mr McCraw. The contention by the Crown is that they played an essential and crucial role. At the bottom of the pyramid is said to have been Mr Lattouf, whose role the Crown describes as at least a very significant one.
In my view, the Crown's contentions so far as Mr Pasinovic - and I will ultimately hold Mr McCraw - is (sic) accurate, and accords with my assessment of the evidence that I have before me beyond a reasonable doubt. I do not consider that Mr Pasinovic has established on the balance of probabilities that he had a lesser role, as the law requires him to do.
51In respect of the conspiracy, his Honour imposed a non-parole period of 10 years and 1 month with a balance of term of 5 years and 2 months.  Pasinovic is eligible for release on parole on 8 September 2017. 
Lattouf52His Honour found (at ROS 15) that Lattouf was at the ""lower end of participation"" and that his role was less than the other co-conspirators.  However he found that because of the value of the drugs, a person in Lattouf's position was necessarily trusted and informed, and that his role was ""important, critical and significant"".  
53His Honour sentenced Lattouf to a non-parole period of 9 years imprisonment commencing on 18 April 2009 and expiring on 17 April 2018, with a balance of term of 5 years expiring on 17 April 2023.  Lattouf is eligible for parole on 17 April 2018.
54In the course of sentencing Lattouf his Honour said (at ROS 13):
Looking at it from the perspective of Mr Lattouf's evidence, it seems unlikely that the mastermind of this conspiracy, Mr Picardi, would have given his own phone, notionally the Michael George phone, to Mr Lattouf, by which he, Mr Picardi, had been contacting Mr McCraw about this conspiracy.55Counsel for the applicant placed some emphasis upon his Honour's reference, in sentencing Lattouf, to Picardi being the ""mastermind"" of the conspiracy.  In particular, it was submitted that this reference was inconsistent with his Honour's conclusions (in [42] and [44] above) regarding the applicant's position at the top of the hierarchy.  
McCraw56His Honour found McCraw to be a mid-level participant who had played an essential and crucial role in securing the removal of the drugs from The Sophie, and subsequently taking possession of them.  His Honour also found that McCraw had recruited Stanley to assist him in that regard.
57In finding that McCraw had a ""high level role"" his Honour emphasised that the conspiracy was a significant international criminal enterprise.  He concluded that McCraw's level of criminality was on a par with that of Pasinovic and imposed a non-parole of 11 years and 2 months imprisonment with a balance of term of 5 years and 10 months.  McCraw is eligible for parole on 15 August 2020.
58McCraw subsequently made an application for leave to appeal to this Court.  Leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed (see McCraw v R [2011] NSWCCA 162).  In the course of that appeal McCraw asserted:
(i)that there was an unjustifiable disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and that imposed upon Pasinovic; and
(ii)that the sentencing judge erred by equating the role of McCraw with that played by Pasinovic.
59Simpson J (with whom Allsop P and Buddin J agreed) observed (at [26]):
""I am unable to accept that the distinctions drawn show that the assessment of Lakatos DCJ was wrong. The submission, it appears to me, oversimplifies the assessment of the roles of participants in a criminal conspiracy. It is not only their overt acts that are relevant; it is a more complex web, involving the nature of the conspiracy, the position in the hierarchy occupied by each conspirator, and the importance of the role played by each individual: see Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247."" 
60Her Honour continued (at [27]):
""Here, the applicant played what was admittedly ""an essential and crucial"" role in supervising the unloading of the drugs from the ship and their transport to their first Australian destination. In order to do that, he manipulated his own work roster, and arranged for at least one other participant to work on Sophie; he personally carried one bag of drugs from the ship to the waiting transport; earlier, he recruited one other employee into the organisation. It is, in my opinion, not to the point that his physical contact with the drugs was of substantially shorter duration than that of Pasinovic. Nor is it to the point (if it be the case) that the time over which he was actively involved (prior to unloading) was of substantially shorter duration than the 46 days during which Pasinovic was actively involved. The evidence suggests that the applicant was, in fact, the Australian counterpart of Pasinovic - the participant to whom Pasinovic handed over on his arrival in Australia.""
THE GROUNDS OF APPEALGround 1 - There is an unjustifiable disparity between the head sentence of the applicant nominated by the sentencing judge and the sentence imposed on his co-offenders, McCraw, Pasinovic and Lattouf.Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in assessing in terms of the hierarchy of criminal conspirators the role of the applicant as being ""at the top of those known"".
61These grounds are interrelated and can be conveniently dealt with together.
Submissions of the parties62As I have previously noted, the findings of the sentencing judge in relation to the applicant's role (set out at [41] to [45] above) were, but for the one matter I have identified, not challenged.  Further, counsel for the applicant took no issue with the fact that:
(i)the starting point of 26 years imprisonment adopted by his Honour was (leaving aside parity considerations) within range;
(ii)the discount of 40 percent to reflect the applicant's assistance to law enforcement authorities was appropriate; and
(iii)the fixing of the ratio of the head sentence to the non-parole period was similarly appropriate.
63Having made these extensive concessions, counsel advanced three principal submissions in support of the grounds relied upon.  
64Firstly, it was submitted that although the applicant's role was greater than that of Pasinovic and McCraw, it was only ""marginally"" so.    
65Secondly, although he did not dispute that the unchallenged findings of the sentencing judge warranted the imposition of a higher sentence on the applicant, counsel submitted that the starting point of 26 years imprisonment adopted by his Honour, which was some 9 years higher than that adopted when sentencing Pasinovic and McCraw, was ""too high"".   It was further submitted that the adoption of such starting point produced a disparity which gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
66Thirdly, counsel submitted that his Honour's conclusions as to the applicant's place in the relevant hierarchy were inconsistent with his subsequent observation (when sentencing Lattouf) that Picardi was the ""mastermind"" of the conspiracy.  Such inconsistency, it was submitted, was reflective of error.    
67Counsel for the Crown set out, in some detail, the various activities undertaken by the applicant in pursuit of the conspiracy.  By reference to those matters, he submitted that a comparison of the role played by the applicant on the one hand, and Pasinovic and McCraw on the other, justified the starting point which had been adopted by his Honour.  
68Counsel for the Crown further submitted that the statement of the sentencing judge to the effect that the present applicant was at the top of the known conspirators was not a finding of fact about his role, but rather a short hand summary of the Crown's submission in relation to that issue.  He further submitted that there was no inconsistency between that reference and his Honour's subsequent observation in relation to Picardi, the latter being described by the Crown as a ""rhetorical part"" of his Honour's analysis of the evidence given in Lattouf's sentencing proceedings.  
Consideration and conclusion69Those who play an authoritative or managerial role in a conspiracy to import prohibited drugs will usually receive a greater sentence than those whose role is less.  In Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247; (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 Simpson J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Harrison J agreed) said (at [79] -[80]):
""Those low in the hierarchy, such as couriers, are usually to be sentenced less harshly because, although they are of fundamental importance in the execution of the object of the conspiracy - in a drug importation conspiracy, without couriers, no drug could or would be imported - they have no managerial or decision making function; and, experience shows, usually derive the least monetary reward.
By contrast, those who have managerial or decision making functions are seen to occupy a more senior position, and, accordingly, to be more culpable.  A relevant factor here is the level of profit to be derived."" 70Her Honour went on to say (at [83]):
""Identifying the ""role"" of a participant by reference to his position in the organisational hierarchy is a very different proposition from isolating the precise physical acts that can be attributed to the particular offender, and selecting the punishment by reference solely to those isolated acts. It would be quite artificial, and contrary to the very concept of a conspiracy, to dissect with precision the physical acts of each of the conspirators, and to sentence that conspirator for those acts alone. That would be a negation of the complex inter-connection between the various participants, and the organisational nature of a conspiracy. It would represent too literal an application of the decisions that identify the ""role"" of any participant as a relevant factor in the sentencing exercise. It would be to ignore the essential feature of the offence of conspiracy - the agreement to participate in an organised criminal activity. 
That is not to say that the physical acts of the offender whose sentence is under consideration are irrelevant. They are relevant, as one part of a complex tapestry: see R v Nguyen [2005] NSWCCA 362; 157 A Crim R 80 at [102]. That, in my opinion, is the first, and most fundamental, flaw in the approach to sentencing here taken.""
71The findings of the sentencing judge, which as I have noted were essentially unchallenged, included that the applicant occupied an organisational role in what was a sophisticated and carefully planned international scheme to import a significant commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.  In contrast, his Honour found that McCraw's role was to secure the removal of the drugs and take possession of them, and that Pasinovic was a functionary who played no directional role at all.  In light of these findings, the submission that the applicant's role was only 'marginally' greater than that of McCraw and Pasinovic is, in my view, without merit.  
72Once it is accepted that the applicant's role was substantially greater than that of either Pasinovic or McCraw, it becomes immediately apparent that there is no justifiable grievance arising out of the applicant's sentence.  In Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ (at [28]) observed that the principle of parity in sentencing requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner, but that it also allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders in order to reflect different degrees of culpability or different circumstances.  Their Honours then referred (at [31]) to the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610 where the Chief Justice said:
""The reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.""
73Their Honours went on to observe (at [31] - [32]):
""The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.""
74In the present case, the sentencing judge assessed the applicant as having occupied a high position in the conspiracy, and having carried out an organisational role.  His Honour's approach to that assessment was consistent with that outlined by Simpson J in Tyler.  On any view, the applicant's role was substantially greater than that of either McCraw or Pasinovic and called for a substantially greater sentence.  In these circumstances, no justifiable sense of grievance arises.  The differing starting points adopted in the case of the applicant on the one hand and Pasinovic and McCraw on the other were a proper reflection of the differing roles they each played.   
75It is also important to bear in mind that the applicant, Pasinovic and McCraw were all sentenced by the same judge.  This Court has long recognised the importance of that circumstance when dealing with issues of parity.  In R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 Barr and Howie JJ said at [71]:
""This was a case where the sentencing of both offenders was by the same judge on the same occasion. Where the same judge sentences two offenders at the same time and gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences he did by having regard to the differing criminality of each, the differing subjective circumstances and the relevant sentencing principles, in our view this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance just because of the different sentencing outcomes.""

76That passage was cited with approval in Pavicevic v R [2010] ACTCA 25 at [21].  Similar views have been expressed in a number of other cases, both in this Court and elsewhere.  Those cases include Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398; R v Spizzerri [2001] VSCA 49; Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; (2011) 205 A Crim R 274; and Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236.  In Gill McColl JA (with whom RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) said (at [58]): 
""Finally, it should be understood that considerable obstacles are faced by an applicant seeking to invoke the parity principle in circumstances where the sentencing judge was fully aware of sentences imposed upon a co-offender, and the reasons for those sentences, and indicates in the sentencing remarks why the judge is departing from the co-offender's sentences.""

77Finally, the applicant's reliance on his Honour's reference to Picardi being the ""mastermind"" is misconceived for two reasons.  Firstly, his Honour's mention of Picardi was essentially a passing reference made in the context of assessing the evidence given by Lattouf in his sentence proceedings.  Secondly, and in any event, his Honour found (at ROS 15 and ROS 23) the applicant was at the top of the hierarchy of the co-conspirators who were parties to the trial.  Picardi, although a co-conspirator, was not a party to the trial.  In these circumstances, there is no inconsistency between those findings and his Honour's later reference to Picardi being the ""mastermind"" of the conspiracy.   
78For all of these reasons, there is no merit in either of the grounds relied upon by the applicant.  No injustice has arisen as a consequence of the sentence which was imposed.
ORDER79I propose the following order:
(i)the application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal is dismissed. 
80R S HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J and with his Honour's reasons.
81I would however add this. In my view, his Honour has been far too generous to the applicant in the extent of his consideration of the merits of the appeal. That degree of consideration effectively means that the applicant has had the full benefit of an appeal despite having no reasonable basis for being granted an extension of time.

2762854,R v Jason Francis COONEY [2013] NSWCCA 312,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: This is an appeal pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 brought by the Crown against the ruling of the primary judge excluding evidence of admissions made by the respondent following his arrest and while in custody. It is common ground that excluding the evidence will ""substantially weaken"" the Crown case. Having regard to the nature and probative value of the admissions, I agree that the requirements of s 5F(3A) are satisfied.

2The salient facts may be stated concisely. The respondent has been charged with six counts of armed robbery and two counts of motor vehicle stealing. On 12 July 2012, police obtained a surveillance device warrant for the purpose of recording conversations between the respondent and undercover police officers. It has not been suggested there was any unlawfulness in the warrant. The respondent was arrested on the morning of 24 July 2012 and at around 7.15am was placed in a cell at Hurstville Police Station. One police officer, ""Chris"", was already ""detained"". There was a conversation in which no admissions were made. ""Chris"" was then taken out of the cell, and returned with a second undercover police officer, ""Reginald"". In the course of building a rapport with the respondent, ""Reginald"" offered to provide the respondent with a barrister. Thereafter the respondent made admissions to participating in some six robberies including those for which he is standing trial.

3Shortly before ""Reginald"" offered to provide the respondent with a barrister, an actual barrister, Mr Patrick Lott, who had been contacted by the respondent's brother that morning, rang Hurstville Police Station's general inquiry section. He rang, according to the findings of the primary judge, at 8.42am, 8.43am and 8.44am. On each occasion the connection went dead after attempts to transfer the call to the charge room. At 8.45am Mr Lott telephoned the cell section. He said, ""I've been trying to call you guys, I understand Jason Cooney is in custody."" He asked to speak with him but was told that he was still being processed. Mr Lott did not ultimately speak with the respondent until 10.22am.

4Argument was advanced on the voir dire based on ss 84, 90 and 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. The primary judge rejected the evidence of the respondent's admissions pursuant to the s 90 of the Evidence Act and argument in this Court has been confined to that section. His Honour accepted that the procedure of obtaining admissions from detained persons in cells in certain circumstances was appropriate. However, his Honour considered that there had been a breach of s 127 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 when the respondent was not informed in a timely fashion of Mr Lott's call. That section is in these terms:

""(1) The custody manager for a detained person must inform the person orally of any request for information as to the whereabouts of the person made by a person who claims to be:
(a) an Australian legal practitioner representing the detained person, or
(b) in the case of a detained person who is not an Australian citizen or a permanent Australian resident, a consular official of the country of which the detained person is a citizen, or
(c) a person (other than a friend, relative or guardian of the detained person) who is in his or her professional capacity concerned with the welfare of the detained person.
(2) The custody manager must provide, or arrange for the provision of, that information to the person who made the request unless:
(a) the detained person does not agree to that information being provided, or
(b) the custody manager believes on reasonable grounds that the person requesting the information is not the person who he or she claims to be.""

5His Honour's conclusion was in these terms:

""The inducement of an offer of the provision of a barrister to Cooney by 'Reginald' was made literally within minutes prior to Cooney making admissions regarding the involvement in robberies.

The offer of the provision of a barrister to Cooney by 'Reginald' prior to making the admissions would have, in all probability, been considered by Cooney in a different light had he been made aware, as he should have been, that a barrister, Mr Lott, had contacted Sergeant Levar in the police cells about him, prior to the offer of the provision of a barrister being made by 'Reginald'.

I find having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made that it would be unfair to Cooney for the Crown to use the evidence of the admissions at the trial.""

6Appellate courts must give deference to the decisions of trial judges, especially in matters such as the reception of evidence. The trial judge had the benefit of lengthy voir dire in which he heard Mr Lott, the police officer who was the custody manager at the time and the two undercover police operatives. The discretion conferred by s 90 is based on ""unfairness"" which is an ""amorphous"" term whose metes and bounds cannot be described exhaustively, as was said in Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67 at [56], [74] and [109]. See also Pavitt v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 88; 169 A Crim R 452 at [30]. It will be seen from the above that the primary judge was persuaded by (a) the seeming contravention of s 127, (b) the fact that a barrister was offered minutes after the call by Mr Lott, and (c) the likelihood that the offer of provision of a barrister would have been considered differently had the respondent been aware that Mr Lott had been attempting to contact him. On a fair reading of his reasons it would appear that the second and third of those elements were regarded by his Honour as a direct consequence of the first. His Honour's reasoning therefore amounts to a conclusion that the admissions were obtained ""in consequence of ... a contravention of an Australian law"" answering the description of s 138.

7The primary judge's concluding paragraph accords with the language of s 90, which required unfairness at the trial, as Gummow and Hayne JJ insisted in Em at [107] and [112]. However, the dispositive reasoning of the primary judge focuses on matters occurring in Hurstville Police Station on 12 July 2012 and in particular the contravention of s 127.

8Gummow and Hayne JJ in Em were of the view that s 90 was not available where there was illegal or improper conduct by police: see [109]. That was a point not determined by the other members of the majority, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J. In my view, at least in its operation to the present facts, it is not possible to rely exclusively on s 90, thereby sidestepping s 138. Section 138 was squarely directed to the facts as found by the primary judge. It is specific. It imposes a different test from that in s 90, including a balancing process, and requires regard to be had to the factors set out in s 138(3). Central to the reasons of the primary judge was the contravention of s 127 and what followed thereafter. That is a consideration which is highly relevant to s 138 and regard to those matters through the prism of s 90 by the primary judge in my view amounts to error which engages House v The King review. For those reasons the order should be set aside.

9It is not possible for this Court to re-exercise that discretion despite the Crown's request that it do so. The primary judge had the benefit of a very lengthy voir dire over a number of days. The primary judge's reasons do not deal with ss 84 or 138 which had been fully argued before him as well. The matter, in my view, must be remitted for determination in accordance with law. Lest there be any doubt, nothing in this judgment is intended to speak to the other submissions which were advanced and which may be advanced again in relation to other sections of the Evidence Act.

10I invite Latham J to give the second judgment.

11LATHAM J: I agree with the orders proposed by Leeming JA and with his reasons. I would only add the following.

12Apart from noting the foundations of the application to exclude the evidence no reasons were provided for the implicit rejection of ss 84 and 138 as a prospective basis for the exclusion of the admissions. To the extent that there was a discussion between bench and bar concerning ss 84 and 138 prior to the provision of formal reasons I do not regard that discussion as a proper basis for the disposition of the argument advanced below. As Leeming JA has noted the formal reasons of the judge do not address ss 84 and 138 at all.

13JOHNSON J: For the reasons given by both Leeming JA and Latham J I also agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge.

14LEEMING JA: I agree with the further remarks of Latham J. The order of the Court therefore will be:

(1)Appeal allowed.
(2)The ruling made by his Honour Acting Judge Solomon on 18 September 2013 be set aside.
(3)The matter be remitted to the District Court for determination in accordance with law.

2762855,R v Karimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No. 11) [2013] NSWSC 1761,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1JOHNSON J: Following a three-month trial, John Khoury (""Khoury""), Mohammad Jawad Karimi (""Karimi"") and Mahdi Mir (""Mir"") were convicted by a jury on 20 June 2013 of a number of serious offences.

2A sentencing hearing proceeded on several days and concluded on 11 October 2013. I remanded the Offenders for sentence today. 

3As will be seen, the offences were committed by members of a criminal group in late June and early July 2010. Khoury was the leader and principal organiser of the group. Karimi was his senior assistant. The offences included home invasions committed by armed young men on 29 June 2010 and 1 July 2010. 

4Khoury and Karimi did not enter the premises, but played critical organisational roles. Mir participated in two home invasion offences on 1 July 2010, whilst armed with a meat cleaver, with a young man being murdered in the course of the second offence.

5Khoury and Karimi were involved in further offences on 4 July 2010, where armed members of the group were travelling to what would have been a violent and lethal confrontation with other persons at Miller, prevented only by police interception of the vehicle carrying the armed members.

The Offences

6Khoury was convicted by the jury of the following offences:

(a)Count 1 - on 29 June 2010 at Villawood - conspiracy to commit armed robbery of Ernesto Bertolli (a common law offence with the maximum penalty under s.97(2) Crimes Act 1900 of imprisonment for 25 years as a reference point);

(b)Count 2 - on 29 June 2010 at Ashcroft - specially aggravated break, enter and steal involving the wounding of James Stiff (s.112(3) Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years);

(c)Count 4 - on 1 July 2010 at Chester Hill - recruiting Tomasi Natuba to carry out a criminal activity, robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (s.351A(1) Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment);

(d)Count 5 - on 1 July 2010 at Warwick Farm - armed robbery of Maxine Rogers (s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment);

(e)Count 6 - on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea - murder of Kesley Burgess (s.18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 20 years);

(f)Count 8 - on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea - robbery of Tracey Burgess whilst armed with an offensive weapon (s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment);

(g)Count 9 - on or about 3 July 2010 at Sydney - conspiracy to murder an unknown person (s.26 Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years);

(h)Count 12 - between 29 June 2010 and 4 July 2010 at Villawood - possession of a prohibited firearm, a shortened .22 calibre long rifle (s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 - maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years).


7Karimi was convicted by the jury of the following offences:

(a)Count 1 - on 29 June 2010 at Villawood - conspiracy to commit armed robbery of Ernesto Bertolli;

(b)Count 2 - on 29 June 2010 at Ashcroft - specially aggravated break, enter and steal involving the wounding of James Stiff;

(c)Count 5 - on 1 July 2010 at Warwick Farm - armed robbery of Maxine Rogers;

(d)Count 6 - on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea - murder of Kesley Burgess;

(e)Count 8 - on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea - armed robbery of Tracey Burgess;

(f)Count 9 - on or about 3 July 2010 at Sydney - conspiracy to murder;

(g)Count 11 - on 4 July 2010 at Miller - possession of a prohibited firearm, a shortened .22 calibre long rifle (s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 - maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years).

8Mir was convicted by the jury of the following offences:

(a)Count 5 - on 1 July 2010 at Warwick Farm - armed robbery of Maxine Rogers;

(b)Count 6 - on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea - murder of Kesley Burgess;

(c)Count 8 - on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea - armed robbery of Tracey Burgess.

9Counts 3, 7 and 10 on the indictment alleged alternative counts, in the event that the jury acquitted on several of the principal counts. Given the verdicts of guilty on the principal counts, it was not necessary to take verdicts on the alternative counts.

The Offenders and Their Associates in June-July 2010

10The Offenders committed a range of serious crimes of violence in a period between 29 June 2010 and 4 July 2010.

11Other persons were involved in a number of these crimes. They have pleaded guilty and have been sentenced (or will soon be sentenced). Four of these persons gave evidence for the Crown in the trial of the present Offenders. These persons will be mentioned in the factual narrative to be given shortly. 

12At this point, it is useful to list all persons who were prosecuted for these matters (including the Offenders), and their ages at the time of the offences:

(a)Khoury (29 years old);

(b)Karimi (22 years old);

(c)Ray Tuki (""Tuki"") (20 years old);

(d)Anaterea Tamapua (""Tamapua"") (20 years old);

(e)John Bautista (""Bautista"") (21 yeas old);

(f)Richard Vergara (""Vergara"") (19 years old);

(g)Tomasi Natuba (""Natuba"") (19 years old);

(h)David Ramos (""Ramos"") (18 years old);

(i)MA (17 years and eight months old);

(j)Thomas Byquar (""Byquar"") (18 years old);

(k)CB (17 years and five months old);

(l)Aimee Walsh (""Walsh""), Khoury's girlfriend (18 years old);

(m)John Unasa (19 years old).

13Of the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph:

(a)MA, Byquar and Ramos were sentenced by me (for murder and other offences) on 11 December 2012: R v MA; R v Byquar; R v Ramos [2012] NSWSC 1527;

(b)Natuba and Tamapua were sentenced by me (for murder and other offences) on 13 December 2012: R v Natuba; R v Tamapua [2012] NSWSC 1569;

(c)Vergara and Bautista were sentenced by his Honour Judge Arnott SC in the District Court on 3 August 2012;

(d)CB was sentenced by his Honour Judge Arnott SC in the District Court on 8 August 2012;

(e)Walsh was sentenced by his Honour Judge Arnott SC in the District Court on 12 December 2012;

(f)Unasa and Byquar are to appear at a sentencing hearing in the District Court on 2 December 2013 (Byquar for matters separate from those for which he was sentenced in this Court on 11 December 2012);

(g)Tuki is to be sentenced by me on 13 December 2013;

(h)Khoury, Karimi and Mir appear for sentence today.

14At the trial of the Offenders, the Crown called (from the above list), the following persons who were prepared to give evidence for the Crown:

(a)Tamapua;

(b)Natuba;

(c)Bautista;

(d)Unasa.

15In addition, the Crown called persons who were associated with one or more of the charged persons. These were:

(a)Witness A, the partner of Tamapua;

(b)Shane Kraak (""Kraak""), an associate of Tamapua;

(c)Kayla Rosso, the partner of Tuki;

(d)Eliza Brown, a friend of Mir.

Fact Finding on Sentence

16It falls to me as the trial Judge to determine punishment and, for that purpose, to make findings of fact relevant to sentencing. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me for the purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378.

17The Court may not take facts into account on sentence, in a way that is adverse to the interests of the offender, unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are matters which the offender relies upon to reduce penalty, it is enough if those matters are proved by the offender on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28]. 

18The Crown submitted that the findings of fact can be identified readily from the verdicts of the jury, in light of the directions relevant to each charge. The Crown submitted that the Court should conclude that the jury accepted:

(a)the uncontested evidence of James Stiff, Maxine Rogers and Tracey Burgess;

(b)the evidence which implicated the Offenders given by Tamapua, Natuba and Eliza Brown;

(c)the evidence of Bautista, Kraak and Witness A to the extent that it supported the evidence of Tamapua, Natuba and Eliza Brown;

(d)telephone intercept evidence relevant to the conspiracy to murder and possess prohibited firearm counts against Khoury and Karimi (Counts 9, 11 and 12);

(e)evidence against Karimi of conversations recorded by listening devices located in the cells at the Liverpool Police Station on 4-5 July 2010.

19Put shortly, the Crown case involved a combination of direct evidence given by witnesses testifying as to the criminal involvement of the Offenders in the offences charged, CCTV and photographic evidence (from a variety of sources), records of telephone calls made from one number to another over a period of days and the locations of the calling and receiving telephones at the time, forensic evidence (including DNA, blood and fingerprint evidence) together with the telephone intercept and listening device evidence. In addition, the Crown relied upon inferences to be drawn from a variety of circumstances, which served to fortify the direct evidence implicating each Offender for each of the offences charged.

20Khoury gave evidence at the trial. His evidence supported the Crown case in a number of significant respects. To the extent that his evidence asserted innocent explanations for otherwise incriminating events, it is clear from the verdicts that the jury rejected it. This was understandable, as important aspects of Khoury's evidence were quite implausible. No other witness was called in Khoury's case.

21Karimi and Mir did not give evidence, nor were any witnesses called on their behalf at trial.

22In my view, the Crown case against each Offender was very strong. The verdicts of the jury were entirely understandable.

23Counsel for each of the Offenders did not contest that the following factual narrative arose from the verdicts of the jury, and could be found as facts for the purpose of sentence. 

24I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following facts.

25In June 2010, Khoury was living with Walsh in a townhouse-style unit at Villawood. Living in another unit, at the same address, was Tuki and his partner, Kayla Rosso. The Villawood unit complex was referred to as ""the Compound"".

26In June 2010, Tamapua and his partner, Witness A, were residing at Claymore. Tamapua had been involved in robbery-type offences with other young men, some of whom came to be involved in the present offences. These included Vergara, Bautista, Kraak, MA and CB.

Khoury Meets Tamapua - An Alliance is Formed

27As at June 2010, Khoury was a drug dealer, dealing particularly in methylamphetamine (Ice). He was assisted by Karimi in his drug dealing. Khoury was also taking over shop premises at 182 Waldron Road, Chester Hill, to operate as a type of variety store.

28Prior to Khoury meeting Tamapua in June 2010, Khoury was looking to increase his drug supply customer base, and he had asked Manuel Puga to assist in finding customers. Mr Puga rented the Chester Hill shop which Khoury was taking over.

29In June 2010, both Khoury and Tamapua were independently associated with a drug dealer named Kevin, who resided in the western suburbs. A short time prior to 29 June 2010, Khoury and Karimi, together with another associate, Tuki, stood over Kevin, demanding money said to be owed to Khoury. 

30Tamapua was present on this occasion. He intervened as he was receiving payment from Kevin to provide protection. In this way, Khoury and Karimi commenced their association with Tamapua. 

31Tamapua was invited to Khoury's unit at Villawood (the Compound). At a meeting at the Compound, Khoury asked Tamapua what he did. Tamapua replied that he protected drug dealers and that a couple of his ""boys"" did home invasions. Khoury told Tamapua that he had some jobs in mind - shutting down drug dealers. Khoury encouraged Tamapua to bring his associates to participate in those jobs. 

32In this way, an alliance was formed between Khoury (and his associates) and Tamapua (and his associates). It is clear that Khoury intended to utilise the services of Tamapua and his ""boys"" to carry out violent crimes on his behalf.

The Criminal Group Becomes Active

33Over the ensuing days, the goal of the criminal group (then including Khoury, Karimi, Tuki, Tamapua and others) included shutting down drug dealers so that Khoury could replace them with his own dealers. The home invasions which came to be undertaken on 29 June 2010 and 1 July 2010 were viewed by Khoury as tests, to see if the new recruits were capable of carrying out bigger jobs at a later time. 

34Prior to the offences committed on 29 June 2010, Khoury introduced Tamapua to a man named Wally at the Compound. Khoury told Tamapua that Wally was someone he looked up to, and that Wally had links to the Bandidos Outlaw Motorcycle gang. Counsel for Khoury submitted that a finding should be made that Wally (not Khoury) was the head of the organisation to which Tamapua was recruited. The evidence of Wally's involvement is limited. It appears that he played a type of advisory role in events, but it was Khoury who was the effective leader and organiser.

35At a meeting at the Compound, Khoury told Tamapua to bring some of his associates the next day, as a person named Harry was to show him a house in Ashcroft thought to be occupied by a drug dealer.

Events on about 28 June 2010 

36Shortly after, on about 28 June 2010, Tamapua attended the Compound with Vergara, Bautista, MA, CB and Ramos. Some of these persons had been involved in earlier criminal activity with Tamapua. 

37Ramos had not been involved in earlier crimes (and had no prior criminal history). It appears he was a friend of Vergara. Ramos' role was to act as driver, using his family's Tarago Van, which was capable of carrying several people. It would be used, as a people mover, to convey groups of persons to and from the scene of serious crimes in the following days.

38Also present at the Compound were Khoury, Karimi, Tuki and Walsh. Khoury told Tamapua that someone was coming over to show them the Ashcroft address, which was to be invaded by the group. Soon after, Harry arrived and was introduced by Khoury as the person who would take them to the Ashcroft address. 

39Khoury gave a shortened .22 rifle to Karimi to take with him on the job. This was the same weapon which was utilised again in the offences contained in Counts 3, 9, 11 and 12. Tamapua got into Harry's vehicle, and Karimi (with the firearm) got into the Tarago Van with Tamapua's associates. The vehicles travelled to Ashcroft and Harry indicated the house. The job did not take place, as Harry was told (by way of a telephone call) that no one was at home and that the dealer was out on a ""drop"". 

40The vehicles returned to the Compound. Khoury was informed that the job did not take place as no one was at home. Khoury said that they should return the next day to carry out the job.

41Tamapua told Khoury that he (Tamapua) had a machete and, at Khoury's request, the machete was left in Khoury's unit at the Compound. This machete was utilised in events giving rise to Counts 3 and 9.

29 June 2010 - Count 1: Conspiracy to Rob Ernesto Bertolli 

42Tamapua and his associates returned to the Compound on 29 June 2010. Present at that time were Khoury, Karimi, Walsh and Tuki. 

43A little later, Tuki left and took his partner, Kayla Rosso, to Liverpool Hospital. As it happens, Tuki became involved in the events of that night, when the badly injured James Stiff was taken to the same hospital. 

44Meanwhile, at the Compound, Khoury told Tamapua that he had a job which involved invading the house of a relative of a former girlfriend to steal firearms. This was the home of Ernesto Bertolli. Khoury had visited the house, and been shown various firearms which Ernesto Bertolli stored lawfully at those premises. 

45Khoury informed Tamapua that there were a number of firearms in the premises. Khoury had a particular desire to obtain a .357 Desert Eagle semi-automatic handgun, which he had seen on the premises. He told Tamapua and his associates that they would be paid the price obtained for any other guns taken.

46The plan was that Khoury and Walsh would travel to the location in Khoury's Holden Commodore, and the others would follow in the Tarago Van driven by Ramos.

47Before leaving the Compound, Khoury took the shortened .22 rifle and a satchel with bullets from a cupboard in his unit. He gave the firearm and satchel to Karimi, who loaded the weapon. Also placed in the Tarago Van was the machete left at the Compound the previous day by Tamapua.

48The Tarago Van was driven away from the Compound by Ramos, with Tamapua, Karimi, Bautista, Vergara, MA and CB on board. The Tarago Van followed the Holden Commodore (containing Khoury and Walsh) to an area near a service station. At that location, Khoury walked to the Tarago Van, located nearby, and pointed out the home of Ernesto Bertolli. Khoury and Walsh then left in the Holden Commodore.

49Ramos drove the Tarago Van and parked near the Bertolli premises. Vergara, Bautista, MA and CB were designated to carry out this home invasion. Karimi handed Vergara the shortened firearm, and one of the others had the machete. The plan was to threaten persons in the house with the weapons, so as to force them to open the gun safe and to take the guns. 

50The four men (armed with the weapons) left the Tarago Van, but returned soon after without having entered the premises, as it was believed that no one was at home.

51Karimi told them to go back to the Bertolli premises because Khoury wanted the Desert Eagle handgun. The four young men again walked towards the Bertolli premises, but returned again without doing the job. Karimi told them to get back into the Tarago Van, and that they would be in trouble when they got back, because Khoury specifically wanted the Desert Eagle handgun.

29 June 2010 - Count 2: The Home Invasion at Ashcroft on the Premises of James Stiff

52The Tarago Van returned to the Compound, and the shortened firearm and machete were taken into Khoury's unit. Karimi informed Khoury that the job did not go through. Khoury said that because they did not do that job, they could make up for it by doing the Ashcroft job. This involved the same premises indicated by Harry the previous day. Khoury picked up the machete and asked which of the men was going to take it. Vergara said that he would take it, and it was handed to him.

53Ramos once again drove the Tarago Van away from the Compound, with Karimi, Tamapua, Vergara, Bautista, MA and CB on board. They travelled to a location near the address of James Stiff at Ashcroft.

54At about 10.40 pm, Vergara (armed with the machete) and Bautista, MA and CB went to the front door of the Stiff residence. One of these men was armed with the shortened .22 rifle. The front door to the Stiff home was closed. An outer screen door was also closed, but not locked.

55One of the young men called out. James Stiff opened the front door. He saw that the closed screen door had been opened, and was being kept open by one of the men. Vergara then came from around the corner, holding the machete. James Stiff put his arm up, and Vergara forcibly struck his left arm with the machete, cutting it open from the wrist to the elbow.

56The four invaders then entered the premises. Also in the premises at the time was James Stiff's partner, his teenage son, Kaerin, and two teenage daughters. 

57Vergara ran down the hallway, striking the walls to terrify the occupants. One of the invaders held the shortened firearm, covered by a red bandana. This person forced James Stiff onto a lounge and said, ""Get off the lounge and I'll kill all of youse"". James Stiff shouted at his children to stay in their rooms. 

58At this point, his teenage son, Kaerin, came out of his room into the hall and saw two men, one with a machete and one with the firearm. The invaders were demanding money and drugs.

59Kaerin Stiff was forced into the main bedroom. He took from a drawer a plastic container, holding about three grams of cannabis, and gave it to one of the invaders. Another invader took a laptop computer from a lounge and then left. 

60As a result of being struck with the machete, James Stiff had a large flap of skin and tissue hanging from his arm. After the invaders left, Kaerin Stiff wrapped his father's arm in a towel and drove him to Liverpool Hospital, arriving at 10.47 pm.

61At this time, Tuki was still at the hospital, and he observed the arrival of James Stiff. He associated the injured man with the home invasion planned for that night. Tuki made telephone calls on his mobile phone to Khoury, reporting on the arrival at hospital of the victim of the home invasion. 

62Vergara, Bautista, CB and MA returned to the Tarago Van and, with Karimi, Tamapua and Ramos, they travelled back to the Compound. Whilst in the Tarago Van, Vergara told them how he hit the victim with the machete and there was blood everywhere.

Return to the Compound

63At the Compound, Karimi patted down the young men who had entered the house, to check that they were not concealing any of the proceeds of the offence. Karimi handed the proceeds to Khoury. 

64Khoury asked what had happened. Vergara explained how he had struck the ""fat boy"" in the arm with the machete. He said there was blood on the machete. Khoury told the group of the call he had received from Tuki, in which Tuki had said that a man had come to the hospital and that his arm had just been chopped.

65Khoury weighed the cannabis taken from the Ashcroft house and gave it to the others to smoke. Karimi brought the shortened firearm into Khoury's unit at the Compound.

66Khoury and Karimi had not entered the Stiff house, although both played major organisational roles concerning the crime. The jury was satisfied that each of Khoury and Karimi was guilty of this offence by application of the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise, to which I will return later in these remarks. 

67Tamapua remained at the Compound for a time after his associates left following the Ashcroft home invasion. Khoury spoke to Tamapua, in the presence of Karimi, of his plan to shut down drug dealers in south-western Sydney, so he could put in his own dealers to make money. 

68Khoury told Tamapua that he should recruit more boys to assist in this process of shutting down dealers. 

1 July 2010 - Counts 4, 5, 6 and 8: The Recruitment of Natuba, Mir Joins the Group, Two More Home Invasions and a Murder

69It was agreed that Tamapua would come to Khoury's shop at Chester Hill on 1 July 2010. Tamapua set out by train for Villawood with Vergara, Kraak and Witness A. Whilst travelling by train, Tamapua met Byquar, who agreed to accompany them. On arrival at Villawood, Tamapua received a telephone call from Tuki, who told them to go to Khoury's shop at Chester Hill.

70During the day on 1 July 2010, telephone contact took place between Karimi and his cousin, Mir. Eliza Brown (then 18 years old) was a friend of Mir. She had met Karimi through Mir.

71Eliza Brown had organised to meet Mir that day. During the afternoon, she received a call from Mir, asking her to pick up Karimi as well. She first picked up Mir and then Karimi. She was asked to drive them to Chester Hill.

72During the journey in Eliza Brown's vehicle, discussion took place in which Karimi said that he was part of a gang, and that Mir was going to join them. Mir told Eliza Brown that he was going to Chester Hill to meet other people who were part of the gang. Eliza Brown expressed concern to Mir, saying that this did not sound like a good idea.

73According to telephone records, Karimi, Mir and Eliza Brown arrived at Chester Hill at about 5.14 pm. They had something to eat and then attended Khoury's shop, where Eliza Brown saw persons, including Khoury and later Tamapua and his associates, after their arrival at the shop. 

74At about 6.11 pm, Tamapua, Byquar, Vergara, Kraak and Witness A arrived at Chester Hill and went to Khoury's shop. At the shop, Tamapua was introduced to Mir by Karimi who said, ""This is Mack, my cousin. He's joined in. He's with us now"". 

75Tamapua introduced Byquar to Khoury. 

1 July 2010Count 4: Khoury Recruits Natuba

76Khoury asked Byquar if he had any other boys. He told Byquar about the gang (called the ""United Brothers"" or ""United Brotherhood"") and that he wanted to expand it. Byquar told Khoury that he had some boys in Doonside. Byquar had in mind his cousin, Natuba. Khoury told Byquar to contact persons to come down to the shop, and that he would put them through an initiation test. 

77As a result of this conversation, a series of text messages passed between Byquar and Natuba, between 6.22 pm and 6.42 pm on 1 July 2010. The information in texts sent by Byquar included the following:

- ""U want 2 recruit 2 united! don't call txt me""

- ""New game cumin up! Connected to benditoz n that!""

- ""cum meet some of the boiz, call me""

78Telephone contact followed between Byquar and Natuba, and Natuba agreed to come to Chester Hill.

79At Karimi's suggestion, some of the persons in Khoury's shop agreed to attend the nearby Chester Hill Hotel to await the arrival of Natuba. 

80Shortly after 7.00 pm, Tamapua, Karimi, Mir, Eliza Brown, Byquar and Kraak entered the Chester Hill Hotel (with their arrival and subsequent movements at the hotel being captured on the hotel's CCTV). Whilst in the hotel, Karimi took Eliza Brown aside, and said that she should never tell anyone about what she had seen or heard, because he would not know what they would do to her if she did tell. 

81Natuba arrived at the hotel at about 8.25 pm. 

82At about 8.49 pm, Eliza Brown left the hotel with Mir and Karimi. They walked to her car. Mir said to Eliza Brown that he was going to stay with the boys. She asked him why, and he said so he could prove himself worthy to them. After Eliza Brown left in her vehicle, Karimi and Mir (now accompanied by Tuki) returned to the Chester Hill Hotel at about 9.12 pm. By that time, Vergara had also arrived at the hotel. 

83At about 9.22 pm, Karimi, Mir and Tuki met up inside the hotel with Tamapua, Byquar, Vergara, Kraak and Natuba. Tuki told Tamapua to get the car ready and to ring Ramos. Calls were then made to Ramos on Vergara's phone.

The Group Returns to Khoury's Shop - Agreement Concerning the Targets for Home Invasions and the Nominated Invaders

84By about 9.45 pm, all persons had left the hotel and had returned to Khoury's nearby shop, a few doors away in Waldron Street, Chester Hill. At the shop, Natuba was introduced to Khoury and discussion took place about the jobs for that night. 

85Karimi asked Khoury, ""Do you want us to do the Jacob job tonight?"". Khoury replied, ""Yes"". This was a reference to Jacob Burgess, the brother of the deceased, Kesley Burgess. Karimi spoke of there being ""ice"", drugs and weapons at that house.

86Tamapua said, ""I've got a drug dealer as well. His name is Beanie Boy. He lives in Warwick Farm"". It was apparent from Tamapua's evidence that ""Beanie Boy"" was disliked by Tamapua, who was keen to include his premises as a target for a home invasion.

87At about 10.21 pm, Ramos and MA arrived at the Chester Hill shop in the Tarago Van.

88Discussion took place between Khoury, Tamapua and Karimi as to who would do the jobs. Karimi said that the newer people to the group had to prove themselves by doing a home invasion. Karimi suggested that Kraak should go. Kraak replied that he did not have to prove himself to anybody. Tamapua said to Khoury, ""Do you reckon we should put these guys through initiation for the Jacob job and the Beanie job?"". Khoury replied, ""Yes - we want to see them in action, see if they've got the balls to do these types of jobs"".

89It was decided by Khoury, Tamapua and Karimi that the persons to enter the houses that evening would be the new recruits, Natuba and Mir, together with Byquar and MA. 

90Khoury's shop was being stocked with various items, including knives and meat cleavers. Khoury brought out four large Elephant brand meat cleavers, together with gloves. These were given to Natuba, Mir, Byquar and MA.

91At about 10.27 pm, the Tarago Van, driven by Ramos, departed with Tamapua, Karimi, MA, Natuba, Mir and Byquar on board.

1 July 2010 - Count 5: Home Invasion on Premises of Maxine Rogers - The ""Beanie Boy"" Job Goes Wrong

92The Tarago Van travelled to Warwick Farm, where Tamapua pointed out the unit complex where it was believed that ""Beanie Boy"" resided. 

93Byquar, Mir, Natuba and MA, each armed with a meat cleaver, went to the front door of a unit occupied by Maxine Rogers (aged 41 years). The invaders believed, mistakenly, that ""Beanie Boy"" lived there. 

94Maxine Rogers became aware of persons at her door and she opened it. As she did so, the invaders pushed open the door and entered the unit. At the time, Maxine Rogers' two young daughters (aged nine and 10 years) were also in the unit. Natuba stayed with Maxine Rogers, whilst the other three invaders searched the premises for drugs and money.

95One of the invaders held a meat cleaver to Maxine Rogers' throat, demanding to know the location of drugs and money. Whilst this was happening, the children told the invaders that they had the wrong house and that the place next door was the one they were after. A laptop computer and mobile phone were stolen from Maxine Rogers.

96The four invaders were heading to the next-door premises, but it was decided that they not do so, because the screaming from Maxine Rogers' unit would have alerted the occupants. 

97On return to the Tarago Van, the invaders informed Tamapua and Karimi that they had entered the wrong premises.

98Tamapua then attempted a number of telephone calls, in an effort to locate ""Beanie Boy"". 
 
Karimi Guides the Group to the Burgess House

99Back in the Tarago Van, after the botched home invasion of Maxine Rogers, Karimi said that the group should travel to Merrylands and pick up his cousin, who knew the address for the ""Jacob job"". Karimi directed Ramos to drive the Tarago Van towards an address in Wallace Street, Granville, where Karimi's uncle and cousins resided. 

100Whilst travelling to this location, Karimi's telephone was used to make a number of calls, including a call at 11.08 pm to a phone associated with his cousin, Abdul Wahid Karimi. Mitchell Kearns gave evidence at the trial that he had previously informed Abdul Wahid Karimi, that the Burgess house at Lurnea was the place where (at a time before July 2010) he obtained cannabis. 

101Near the address at Wallace Street, Granville, a white two-door Toyota Echo pulled up near the Tarago Van. Karimi and Tamapua got into the white vehicle, and Karimi introduced the driver to Tamapua as his cousin. As at 1 July 2010, a white two-door Toyota Echo was registered in the name of Karimi's cousin. Police later located that vehicle parked outside the premises at Wallace Street, Granville. I am satisfied that it was Karimi's cousin's vehicle which met the Tarago Van on the night of 1 July 2010.

102At about 11.11 pm, the Tarago Van and Toyota Echo pulled into a service station at Merrylands. Whilst at the service station, Karimi told persons in the Tarago Van to follow the white car. The two vehicles travelled in convoy to Lurnea, arriving at around 11.36 pm. 

103The two vehicles drove down Clingan Avenue, Lurnea, and parked in a nearby street. A security camera at a nearby house in Clingan Avenue recorded the arrival and departure of two vehicles travelling together that night. These were the Tarago Van and the Toyota Echo approaching and then fleeing the Burgess house.

104Karimi got out of the Toyota Echo and spoke to the persons in the Tarago Van. He made sure that they knew which house was to be entered, and told them to grab drugs and money, and warned that there may be a shotgun, which they should also take. 

1 July 2010 - Counts 6 and 8: Home Invasion and Murder of Kesley Burgess and Robbery of Tracey Burgess

105At some time after 11.15 pm, Byquar, Mir, Natuba and MA (each carrying a meat cleaver) went to the door of the Burgess residence. 

106Inside the Burgess premises at the time were Tracey Burgess (47 years old), her son, Kesley Burgess (25 years old), his girlfriend, Kristal McLachlan (24 years old), and a family friend, Gary Venus (56 years old). Gary Venus was in the lounge room, and other members of the household were in their bedrooms. Jacob Burgess had left the house a short time before the home invasion.

107Byquar knocked on the front door of the Burgess home whilst Natuba waited at the side. Gary Venus opened the door and was immediately pushed backwards onto the floor. Byquar, Natuba, MA and Mir then entered through the front door and moved to the lounge room, each armed with a meat cleaver. 

108Tracey Burgess had heard the knock at the front door and emerged from her bedroom to see Gary Venus being knocked to the floor, and then kicked by one of the invaders. Tracey Burgess ran down the hallway towards the bedroom of Kesley Burgess.

109Natuba moved up the hallway and confronted Tracey Burgess with his meat cleaver, screaming that he wanted money and drugs. Natuba grabbed Tracey Burgess by her nightie and forced her into her bedroom, smashing items on her dressing table. They moved back to the hallway, where Natuba threatened to kill her if she did not give him what he wanted. Natuba then swung the meat cleaver which struck the hand of Tracey Burgess as she used her hand to cover her face.

110Kristal McLachlan was in the bedroom with Kesley Burgess. They had been watching television. She heard banging and screaming. Kesley Burgess left the bedroom and pushed his mother back into his bedroom.

111Kesley Burgess picked up a sword (which had been in the house) and told his mother and his girlfriend to stay in the bedroom. Both did so, and they heard screaming and banging coming from outside the bedroom.

112Natuba was in the hallway when Kesley Burgess emerged from his bedroom with the sword. Kesley Burgess struck Natuba to the shoulder, wounding him. Natuba backed away and he noticed Byquar, who had been in the kitchen, hit Kesley Burgess in the back a couple of times with his meat cleaver. Natuba also saw Mir hit Kesley Burgess with his meat cleaver a couple of times to the front of his body. Kesley Burgess fell to the floor. Natuba flipped over a coffee table and yelled, ""Where's the drugs, where's the money?"". Kesley Burgess replied, ""We don't have any"". Natuba then hit Kesley Burgess once to the leg with his meat cleaver.

113At one point, whilst the invaders were attacking Kesley Burgess with meat cleavers, Byquar swung his meat cleaver at Kesley Burgess, but missed, striking his own foot and thereby causing a deep cut which bled freely.

114By this time, Tracey Burgess had emerged from the bedroom. She saw three of the invaders standing over Kesley Burgess, chopping him with their meat cleavers. Tracey Burgess screamed out, ""Kill me, kill me, not him. Kill me"". She observed one of the men looking at her with what she described as a ""half laugh"". 

115The fourth invader was in the kitchen. Tracey Burgess had fallen to her knees, but she rose and entered the kitchen, picking up a Jim Beam tin (in the shape of a racing car) which contained cannabis. She threw the tin at one of the invaders saying, ""That's all we've got. Take this"". This invader took the tin, and also a handbag and beach bag which were in the kitchen. One of the invaders yelled, ""Let's go"" and they left.

116Whilst the invaders were in the house, Tracey Burgess asked Kristal McLachlan to call ""000"" and she did so. During the call, one of the invaders entered the bedroom and demanded that she get off the phone or he would kill her. Kristal McLachlan threw the phone at this person, who put it in his pocket. 

117After the invaders had left, Tracey Burgess screamed out to Kristal McLachlan to call an ambulance. Further ""000"" calls were made. The recordings of the ""000"" calls reveal the distressed sounds of the voices of Tracey Burgess and Kristal McLachlan calling for urgent assistance. The terror instilled in these persons, as a result of these vicious crimes, is manifest from the recordings of their calls for help. 

118Tracey Burgess knelt beside her son. The ferocious nature of the attack (as described, in particular, by Tracey Burgess and Natuba) is supported by the crime scene photographs. Tracey Burgess attempted to stem the flow of blood by wrapping towels around the injuries to her son. The last words spoken by Kesley Burgess to his mother were, ""I'm going to pass out Mum, I love you"".

119Senior Constable Churchill, who attended the premises at about 11.50 pm, observed Kesley Burgess lying on the floor covered in blood. He observed a large wound to the left leg. The laceration to the left wrist had almost severed the hand. 

120Ambulance officers attended and attempts were made to stem the blood loss. Kesley Burgess was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital. He passed away at 9.15 pm on 2 July 2010. 

121Dr Wills conducted a post-mortem examination on 3 July 2010. Kesley Burgess died as a result of eight incised injuries. The combination of injuries, particularly where there had been underlying vascular damage, resulted in blood loss, hypotension and ultimately cardiac arrest, which was relatively prolonged, prior to cardiac output being re-established during emergency assistance. Hypoxic brain injury was sustained as a consequence.

122The incised defects in the bone to both wrists, and the posterior aspect of the left lower limb bones, indicated the application of severe force. The wounds to the upper limbs were defensive in nature, and indicated that Kesley Burgess was conscious and mobile for at least some time during the attack. The combination of the incised injuries indicated at least seven separate wounding actions.

The Invaders Flee the Burgess Home and Return to Khoury's Shop

123Byquar, Natuba, Mir and MA left the Burgess house. Mir entered the Toyota Echo in which Karimi and Tamapua were waiting with the driver. Mir climbed over Tamapua and sat in the back seat. Tamapua observed that Mir was holding a meat cleaver and was covered in blood. The other invaders entered the Tarago Van and the two vehicles returned to Khoury's shop at Chester Hill.

124On their return to the Chester Hill shop, it was observed that both Natuba and Byquar were injured. Khoury, Tuki, Vergara, Walsh, Kraak and Witness A were present in the shop. The four men who had invaded the houses entered the shop, as did Tamapua and Karimi. The property taken from the two home invasions was brought into the shop. 

125The meat cleavers were also brought into the shop. I am satisfied that the meat cleavers remained at Khoury's shop for a period. As will be seen, three of the meat cleavers were discovered at Khoury's premises at Ingleburn when he was arrested on 29 September 2010. 

126Khoury asked what had happened and Karimi said, ""The job's done"". Natuba told Khoury how he had injured his shoulder, as did Byquar, who said that he had attempted to hit the victim, missing him and striking his own foot. Mir also discussed what he had done, saying, ""Did you see how I got the cunt"" and ""I got him in the arms"". Blood was observed on Mir's clothing. 

127Discussion took place concerning the need for Natuba to receive medical treatment. Khoury told Natuba not to go to Liverpool Hospital, as it was too close to the Burgess house, and that he should go to Bankstown Hospital instead. A false story was devised to explain how Natuba had come to suffer his injuries. 

128It was agreed that Ramos and Vergara would take Natuba to Bankstown Hospital. Ramos drove them there in the Tarago Van, and Natuba and Vergara went inside. 

129Mir called Eliza Brown asking that she pick him up. She collected Mir across the road from Khoury's shop. She noticed blood on Mir's pants. In the car whilst travelling to Granville, Mir told Eliza Brown that he had gone with a group of people to stop a guy from dealing weed, and that they had got into a fight and the guy had got cut and some other guy got the top of his shoulder cut and had to go to hospital. Eliza Brown asked Mir, ""Why does it matter if someone deals weed?"" and Mir replied, ""Because that person wasn't dealing for the person who runs the area"". 

130Khoury's associate, Wally, arrived at the Chester Hill shop in the early hours of the morning of 2 July 2010. Khoury informed Wally that one of the boys had been sent to hospital. Discussion ensued in the presence of Tamapua, Kraak and others concerning future jobs. Wally enquired as to whether the boys were ready and Khoury responded, ""Not now Monday"". (The next Monday was 5 July 2010).

131Tamapua returned to the Compound and further discussion took place with Khoury and Wally. Wally said to Khoury, ""These boys must be ready for the big jobs"". In the course of discussion as to the nature of these jobs, Wally said in Khoury's presence, ""Just stuff to do with money, extortion, kidnapping and stuff like that"". 

Police Speak to Natuba at Bankstown Hospital

132At about 1.15 am on 2 July 2010, police attended Bankstown Hospital for a purpose unrelated to this matter. Whilst there, police were informed that an injured man (Natuba) was in the Emergency Department. Police spoke to Natuba, who gave a false account as to how he came to be injured.

133At about 3.45 am, police again spoke to Natuba who continued to give a false account. 

134At about 4.00 pm on 2 July 2010, a video interview of Natuba was conducted by police at Bankstown Hospital, at the commencement of which he was told he was under arrest for the home invasions of the Maxine Rogers unit and the Burgess house. At this point, Natuba told police that his earlier account was false and that he had been involved in these offences. Thereafter, Natuba co-operated with police in ways which proved vital to the shutting down of the criminal group.

135During 2 July 2010, police initiated telephone intercepts with respect to the telephones of Tamapua, Vergara, Natuba and Kraak. 
 
Events on 3 July 2010

136A number of intercepted telephone calls involving Khoury, Tamapua, Karimi and others revealed an ongoing interest in drug supply on 2 and 3 July 2010. By way of example, in a conversation at about 1.30 am on 3 July 2010, Khoury informed Tamapua that he had not sold ""Coca Cola"" (cocaine) for five or six months, and that he was only stocking ""Sprite"" (ice) (Exhibit DA, Tab 7).

137On the morning of 3 July 2010, major media outlets reported that Kesley Burgess had died. 

138On the afternoon of 3 July 2010, Khoury took part in a meeting in his unit at the Compound, attended by Tamapua, Byquar, Unasa and others. Unasa had been brought to the Compound by Byquar as a potential new recruit to the United Brotherhood. Khoury was described to Unasa as the ringleader. Unasa described Tamapua as being an imposing presence at this meeting as well. It was known by that time that Kesley Burgess had died as a result of the injuries sustained in the home invasion on 1 July 2010.

139It is noteworthy that this meeting took place at Khoury's premises, for the purpose of recruiting Unasa for criminal purposes, despite the fact that Khoury and others were well aware that the home invasions committed in the previous days had seen one man severely injured (James Stiff) and another man killed (Kesley Burgess). 

140Knowledge of these consequences did not operate to deter the planning by Khoury (in particular) for further offences to be committed.
 
3-4 July 2010 - Counts 9, 11 and 12: Offences Committed by Khoury and Karimi Relating to an Event at Miller

141On the evening of 3 July 2010, Unasa and Byquar attended the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre at Miller where a Polynesian night was to be staged to raise funds. About 350-400 people of Polynesian descent, including families and children, attended the event where food and alcohol were being consumed and security guards were provided. 

142Late in the evening of 3 July 2010, an incident occurred which led Byquar to make phone calls, urgently summonsing assistance from members of the criminal group. 

143The Crown case with respect to Count 9 (in particular) was based very largely on telephone intercepts between about 11.28 pm on 3 July 2010 and 1.25 am on 4 July 2010. This evidence graphically portrayed what was being said by relevant persons. It is fair to describe these events as a call to arms by Byquar, responded to quickly by Karimi, Khoury, Tamapua, Vergara and Tuki. Armed members of the group were deployed quickly to Miller to assist Byquar and Unasa. 

144A selection of intercepted telephone calls provides a clear contemporaneous record of what was on foot. At about 11.28 pm on 3 July 2010, Byquar rang Karimi in a very agitated state, indicating that he needed ""guns down here right now"". Byquar said to Karimi, ""We need guns here right now, bro ... because there's gonna be a killing spree and we're gonna look after one of your boys - remember the boy that came today?"". This was a reference to Unasa, who had attended the meeting at Khoury's premises earlier that day and had been recruited to the group. Karimi said that he was going to, ""call the boys"". 

145Soon after, at 11.38 pm, Tamapua rang Unasa, looking for Byquar. 

146About a minute later, Byquar again rang Karimi, with Byquar explaining, ""Guns, knives or anything, bro. We need it down here now"". Byquar stated, ""we're gonna fucking kill these cunts, bro"". The conversation continued (Exhibit DA, Tab 21):

Byquar - ""Oy, he's our boy [Unasa]. He's our family, remember?"".

Karimi - ""Yeah, yeah. Yeah, relax. I'm coming, I'm coming"".

Byquar - ""Lad, tell them: bring, bring knives, guns or anything, bro. We're, we're ..."".

Karimi - ""All right"".

Byquar - ""... gonna kill them tonight. Yeah?'.

Karimi - ""All right, no worries. Yeah ..."".

Byquar - ""All right?"".

Karimi - ""... yeah, yeah, all good. All right, all right"".

147At 11.42 pm, Tamapua rang Vergara, indicating that Byquar was in trouble and that he should hurry up. 

148At 11.43 pm, Tamapua rang Unasa, attempting to locate Byquar. Unasa said that Byquar was ""gathering up all the boys"".

149At 11.47 pm, Byquar again rang Karimi to emphasise the need for immediate action.

150In subsequent telephone calls involving Tamapua and others, Tamapua stated that he was ""going to go fuckin' shut these cunts up"", and there was discussion concerning the picking up of items for that purpose. 

151At 11.56 pm, Byquar spoke to Karimi again concerning the despatch of persons to assist Byquar. The conversation included the following (Exhibit DA, Tab 28):

Byquar - ""Bro, you got the choppers and shit? You got the choppers?"". 

Karimi - ""I got it - brother! Just give me ten minutes, man. I'll call you back"".

152In a conversation between Tamapua and Byquar at 00.07 am on 4 July 2010, Byquar explained that persons were waiting outside for Unasa so as to ""jump him"", and that Byquar was ""waiting for youse boys so you can come down we'll just chop the fuck out of all of them"". There was discussion as to what was being brought for this purpose, with Tamapua saying, ""I'm not bringing the slicing, I'm bringing the other one"". Byquar replied, ""... bring my slice for me so I can just slice one cunt"". 

153At 00.11 am on 4 July 2010, Byquar spoke to Karimi by telephone, with Khoury being present at Karimi's end of the line. Khoury spoke to Byquar directly and asked him what was going on. The conversation included the following (Exhibit DA, Tab 35):

Khoury - ""Sonny [Byquar], what's going on?"".

Byquar - ""Yeah, bro, we're on a (unintelligible). Few cunts try and jump and the other boy that come today?"".

Khoury - ""Can't hear"".

Byquar - ""You know the boy, the boy that came today? You know one of, one of the boys that came today? John-John [Unasa]"".

Khoury - ""Yeah, yeah"".

Byquar - ""Yeah, yeah. They're trying to jump him outside. We want to kill these cunts outside, bro. We want to kill them. (Unintelligible). Samoan like, it's like they're celebrating something to help some poor kid but these cunts are trying to fuck, you know fuck with them. So we will, soon as you get here, bro, we're just going to kill the cunts"".

Khoury - ""All right"".

Byquar - ""Yeah?"".

Khoury - ""All right, no worries. It's all ready to rock and roll"".

Byquar - ""Make, make sure you call me like five minutes before, yeah?"".

Khoury - ""So anyway, listen, listen, listen"".

Byquar - ""Yeah"".

Khoury - ""You're all right but, yeah?"".

Byquar - ""Yeah, I'm sweet, I'm sweet. I'm fucking, I'm ready to fucking kill these cunts, bro"".

Khoury - ""Yeah, all right, no worries. That's all good"".

Byquar - ""Want to slash a (unintelligible) fuck going to kill him, bro"".

Khoury - ""All right, bye"".

Byquar - ""All right. (Sounds like) Eetsway, call me, call me soon as, soon as you get here"".

Khoury - ""Yeah, yeah, they're all getting off too"".

Byquar - ""Yeah, yeah five minutes before you get here, [sounds like] eetsway, eetsway"".

Khoury - ""All right, all right"".

154At 00.12 am, Tamapua spoke to Vergara by telephone with Khoury in the background. There was discussion about picking up the ""ungay"" (gun) with Vergara stating that they were ""leaving now"". 

155Whilst these telephone conversations were taking place, Tuki and others had set off in a Ford Laser owned by Tuki's partner. The vehicle travelled to Claymore to pick up Tamapua. Thereafter, the Ford Laser headed for Miller, driven by Tuki and with Karimi, Tamapua and Vergara in the vehicle. Also in the vehicle was the shortened .22 calibre long rifle (Counts 11 and 12) which had been collected from Khoury's unit. In addition, a large machete owned by Tamapua was in the vehicle. This machete had been used to attack James Stiff at the Ashcroft home invasion on the evening of 29 June 2010. The shortened .22 rifle had been used in that offence as well.

156As the Ford Laser drew closer to Miller, further telephone conversations took place. 

157At 00.48 am, Byquar spoke to Karimi by telephone. Karimi explained that they were close but enquired as to whether there were any ""oppercays"" (coppers) in the vicinity. Byquar confirmed that there were and suggested that they "".. wait up the road and hide the ungay"". Karimi said, ""All right, I'm going to go, I'm going to go up the road, hide it and then walk down"". Karimi enquired again as to how many police were in the vicinity to which Byquar responded, ""There's heaps"". Karimi said, ""Fuck me dead. How the fuck are we going to do this, bro?"". Shortly after, Karimi handed the telephone to Tamapua (also in the Ford Laser) and Tamapua and Byquar discussed the precise location. 

158Further calls ensued between Unasa or Byquar (on the one hand) and the occupants of the Ford Laser. 

159At about 1.15 am on 4 July 2010, police stopped the Ford Laser in Miller. Tuki, Tamapua, Karimi and Vergara were removed from the vehicle. By that time, there was understandable concern on the part of police, who were monitoring the telephone calls, that very significant acts of violence would occur if the four men in the Ford Laser joined up with Byquar at Miller. Located in the vehicle were the machete in a sheath and the shortened .22 calibre long rifle, together with a knife.

160Subsequent forensic examination of the machete revealed a DNA profile of James Stiff. Khoury's DNA was located on the shortened .22 calibre long rifle.

161Tuki, Tamapua, Karimi and Vergara were all placed under arrest. 

162At 1.25 am, Khoury spoke to Byquar by telephone. Khoury enquired as to what was happening, observing, ""They should've been there ages ago. What's going on?"". The conversation continued (Exhibit DA, Tab 49):

Byquar - ""Well, that's, that's the thing, bro. I'm waiting for youse here. Where are youse?"".

Khoury - ""What do you mean, brother? All the boys, with Terra [Tamapua] and that all fucking rang me up half an hour ago from ah, Miller"".

Byquar - ""Yeah, that's sweet. Can you call him and tell him to call me?"".

Khoury - ""I've been trying to get through to them, none of them are answering their phone"".

Byquar - ""Yeah, no-one's answering their phone, bro. That's the thing 'cause its 'cause there's heaps of oppers here. That's why I, we got to move out of this area and then so they can pick me up somewhere"".

Khoury - ""All right. All right, bye"".

163Khoury and Byquar were unable to make telephone contact with the occupants of the Ford Laser because the police had intercepted the vehicle and arrested its occupants. 

164The contemporaneous content of these telephone calls, which I have recited in some detail, demonstrates the serious criminal intent of those involved, including, for present purposes, a clear agreement on the part of Karimi and Khoury with others to murder a person on the other side of Byquar's dispute at Miller. Both Khoury and Karimi demonstrated a consistent preparedness to send armed reinforcements to assist Byquar, in the knowledge that lethal force was intended to be used. All of this, of course, occurred in the context of concern for Unasa, who had been recruited to the criminal group effectively run by Khoury just hours before these events.

165At about 1.30 am, police approached Byquar in Miller and placed him under arrest. 

29 June 2010 - 4 July 2010 - Counts 11 and 12: Possession of Shortened Firearm by Khoury and Karimi

166In relation to Count 11, the jury was satisfied that Karimi was in possession of the shortened firearm that was to be used at Miller, having picked it up from Khoury at Khoury's premises at the Compound. 

167The Crown case in support of Count 12 was that between 29 June 2010 and 4 July 2010, Khoury possessed the shortened .22 calibre long rifle at his Villawood premises. In this respect, I am satisfied that the jury accepted the evidence of Tamapua and Bautista concerning the location of this firearm at Khoury's premises, taken with the DNA evidence that indicated that Khoury had held it, and the telephone intercept evidence of events in the late evening of 3 July 2010 and the early hours of 4 July 2010, where the firearm was collected from Khoury's premises for the purpose of it being taken to Miller, to be used in this planned violent confrontation. 

Listening Device Evidence Against Karimi

168Following the arrests at Miller in the early hours of 4 July 2010, Karimi, Vergara, Tamapua, Tuki and Byquar were taken to Liverpool Police Station. Listening devices used lawfully under warrant were located in the cells at the Police Station. Conversations were recorded on 4 and 5 July 2010. This evidence was admitted at trial against Karimi only. 

169Over a period of time, Karimi discussed with one or more of the others how they came to be arrested, and how the police could link them to the home invasions on 1 July 2010. Karimi and others concluded that Natuba must have been assisting police with telephones being tapped. 

170At one point, Karimi enquired of Tuki, ""Didn't you call any of the brothers"" and there was discussion that ""the Compound"" had been watched.

171In a context relating to the Lurnea matter, Karimi said to Tuki, ""I'm goneski"".

172A little later, Karimi told Tuki that he was ""fucked sideways ... for the ungay"", a clear reference to the shortened firearm.

173Karimi and Tuki discussed the ""Lurnea"" job in a manner indicating clear knowledge on Karimi's part of that offence (the Burgess home invasion).

Further Investigative Steps on and After 4 July 2010

174On 4 July 2010, police executed a crime scene warrant at Khoury's shop, and forensic examination of the premises proceeded over the next three days. This examination found several sources of human blood and extensive evidence of blood clean up. Subsequent analysis identified the blood as being that of Natuba and Byquar.

175The Jim Beam tin taken from the Burgess home was found by police inside Khoury's shop with blood smears on it. Fingerprints belonging to Karimi, Khoury and Walsh were identified on the tin, as well as the DNA and fingerprints of Kesley Burgess. 

176Fingerprints belonging to Khoury, Tuki, Vergara, Karimi, Walsh and MA were found at different areas in Khoury's shop. 

177The search of Khoury's shop revealed boxes of Elephant brand meat cleavers, of the type used in the offences committed on 1 July 2010. 

178Forensic examination of the Burgess home found the blood of Natuba on a coffee table in the lounge room where Kesley Burgess had been attacked.

179Tamapua told police that he had taken Kesley Burgess' mobile phone with blood on it. After Tamapua's arrest, Kraak placed the mobile phone inside a sock and secreted it at the rear of a neighbour's property in Claymore. Police attended that location and found the mobile phone, with subsequent analysis identifying Kraak's DNA and Byquar's blood on the mobile phone.

180On 22 July 2010, police mounted a large-scale operation where Mir, Ramos, MA, Tamapua and Byquar were arrested and charged with the murder of Kesley Burgess.

181On 29 September 2010, police arrested Khoury and Walsh at Khoury's premises at 7/48 Lancaster Street, Ingleburn. A search warrant was executed at those premises, and a bag was located which contained three Elephant brand meat cleavers wrapped in a towel.

182Forensic analysis of those meat cleavers identified Tuki's fingerprint on the blade of one, Tuki's DNA on the handle of a meat cleaver and Kesley Burgess' blood on the blade of one of the meat cleavers.

Criminal Liability of Karimi, Khoury and Mir for the Offences

Count 1

183In convicting each of Khoury and Karimi on Count 1, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between two or more persons to commit an armed robbery at the premises of Ernesto Bertolli, and that each of Khoury and Karimi participated in the agreement that the unlawful objective be carried out, whilst intending that objective should be carried into effect. 
 
Count 2

184In convicting each of Khoury and Karimi on Count 2, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a home invasion had been carried out on the Ashcroft premises of James Stiff, with property being stolen and with James Stiff being wounded in the course of the offence.

185It was the Crown case that Karimi remained in a vehicle outside the Ashcroft premises whilst the home invasion took place. Khoury was at his residence at Villawood at the time. 

186Each of Khoury and Karimi were convicted of this offence by application of the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise, in that each of them was a party to a joint criminal enterprise, to commit robbery in the course of a home invasion, and each of them contemplated the possible wounding of a person in premises during the course of the home invasion. 

187The jury was satisfied that each of Khoury and Karimi were well aware that young men who had engaged in violent crimes with Tamapua were to undertake the home invasion whilst armed. Khoury and Karimi each understood that the premises to be invaded were those of a drug dealer. It is entirely understandable how the jury reached their verdicts convicting each of Khoury and Karimi on Count 2.

Count 4

188In finding Khoury guilty on Count 4, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was at the request of Khoury that contact was made by Byquar with Natuba to join the criminal group. The message, ""U want 2 recruit 2 United!"" constitutes contemporaneous evidence that the term ""United Brothers"" or ""United Brotherhood"" was being used at that time to recruit persons to Khoury's group. 

189Having met Natuba, Khoury accepted him as part of the group, subject to Natuba completing home invasions as an initiation or test. Natuba participated that very night in the home invasions upon the premises of Maxine Rogers and the Burgess family. 

Counts 5, 6 and 8

190With respect to the offences encompassed by Counts 5, 6 and 8, the evidence revealed that Karimi was in the Tarago Van outside the Maxine Rogers premises, and then was in the white Toyota Echo in the vicinity of the Burgess house, when the respective crimes were committed. 

191The evidence reveals that Khoury was at his shop at Chester Hill, from where the invaders had departed that evening, and to which they returned after the crimes had been committed.

192With respect to Count 5, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a home invasion was carried out on the premises of Maxine Rogers involving armed robbery of property from her. 

193Each of Khoury and Karimi were convicted on Count 5 by application of the principles of joint criminal enterprise, in that each of them was a party to an agreement to carry out a home invasion and that each of them participated in that agreement, although not being amongst the invaders that entered the premises.

194With respect to Mir, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was one of the invaders, armed with meat cleavers, who entered the premises of Maxine Rogers, and participated in an armed robbery of her. 

Count 6

195The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of Khoury and Karimi was liable for the murder of Kesley Burgess by application of the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise. The jury was satisfied that each of Khoury and Karimi were party to an agreement to commit robbery in the course of a home invasion by armed persons, that each of them participated in that joint criminal enterprise, and that each of Khoury and Karimi contemplated the possible intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm to a person in the course of that home invasion. 

196This conclusion is entirely understandable. Each of Khoury and Karimi were aware that violent young men were to undertake home invasions, whilst armed with heavy meat cleavers, as part of a testing or initiation process. The very weapons with which Khoury had armed these young men on 1 July 2010 laid a solid foundation for the jury's finding. Each of Khoury and Karimi were aware, as well, that a substantial act of violence had occurred on 29 June 2010, when Vergara struck and wounded James Stiff. 

197There was a clear foundation for the jury finding that Khoury participated in the joint criminal enterprise to commit robbery in the course of a home invasion by armed men. This participation included recruitment of the participants, the planning and sanctioning of jobs, the provision of premises (Khoury's shop) to launch the jobs, the provision of weapons and the receipt of at least part of the stolen property. It was Khoury who devised the use of the jobs as tests for members of the criminal group. The purpose of the jobs was to further Khoury's goal of running the dealing of drugs in the south-western Sydney area. 

198The jury was satisfied that Karimi participated in the joint criminal enterprise, including the planning of jobs, and in particular, the ""Jacob job"" proposed by Karimi, with Karimi then using his family connections to identify the location at Lurnea. He also oversaw the home invasions by travelling with co-offenders to the various locations, and giving instructions to co-offenders who entered the premises. It was also part of Karimi's role to ensure that property which had been taken was accounted for to Khoury. 

199The jury verdict adverse to Mir on Count 6, involved a finding that he entered the Burgess household, armed with a meat cleaver, for the purpose of participating in a home invasion. Mir was carrying out this function as part of a test or initiation. 

200I am satisfied to the criminal standard that Mir entered the house, armed with a meat cleaver, and that he struck Kesley Burgess with the meat cleaver. The evidence of Natuba and Tracey Burgess concerning events in the house supports this conclusion. Further, the evidence of Tamapua, Kraak and Witness A of their observations of Mir when he returned to Khoury's shop, and what they heard Mir say concerning the attack, further supports such a conclusion. Finally, there is the evidence of Eliza Brown of her observations of Mir when she collected him from Chester Hill, and of the conversation which took place in the car thereafter. In combination, this constituted a very substantial body of evidence that Mir not only entered the house armed with a meat cleaver, but that he used the weapon to strike Kesley Burgess in such a way that he was a direct participant in his murder, and was stained with blood as a result. 

201Submissions were made as to whether Mir acted with intent to kill or intent to cause grievous bodily harm. I am satisfied, to the criminal standard, that Mir acted with intent to kill, in circumstances where he struck more than one blow to Kesley Burgess with a heavy meat cleaver, at a time when others were also attacking Kesley Burgess with similar weapons. 

202That this intent may have only come about suddenly because of the actions of Kesley Burgess in using a sword to strike Natuba in defence of his mother, does not provide any real assistance to Mir on sentence. It is clear that Kesley Burgess could have been disarmed or disabled in other ways that did not involve the homicidal attack which took place in his own home and in the presence of his mother.


Count 8

203The conviction by the jury of each of Khoury and Karimi on Count 8 involved application of the principles of joint criminal enterprise. The jury was satisfied that each of Khoury and Karimi was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to commit robbery in the course of a home invasion by armed persons. The participation of Khoury and Karimi in this respect is of the type referred to earlier in these remarks. 

204The conviction of Mir on Count 8 reflects acceptance by the jury that Mir was one of the armed assailants who entered the Burgess household, in the course of which Tracey Burgess was robbed of property. 

Counts 9, 11 and 12

205I have referred earlier to the bases on which Khoury and Karimi were convicted of conspiracy to murder. On the evidence, the intention of each of Khoury and Karimi was to kill a person at a public place where a large number of persons had gathered for a community event to raise funds for a charity. Although the event had concluded and persons were departing, the evidence points to the fact that families and young persons were in the vicinity so that the danger posed to the general public was high. 

206The verdicts of the jury on Counts 11 and 12 involved acceptance that each of Khoury and Karimi were aware that weapons were in the vehicle conveying members of the group to Miller to assist Byquar. Each of Khoury and Karimi were aware of the fact that these weapons included the shortened .22 calibre long rifle which had been located at Khoury's premises, and the large machete which had also been at those premises. 

207Both Khoury and Karimi were aware that these weapons had been utilised in the home invasions committed over previous days. The fact that the occupants of the vehicle had armed themselves with these weapons reinforced a conclusion that they were prepared to assist Byquar directly in his clearly stated intent to murder. There could be no doubt that the weapons in the Ford Laser were capable of being used to kill a person. 

208It is necessary to keep in mind, as well, that the explanation for Khoury and Karimi acting in this way at that time, was that each of them was prepared to participate in an act of revenge against persons who had apparently done nothing more than come into conflict with Unasa, a person who had joined the criminal group involving Khoury and Karimi a short time before. 

Relevance of Standard Non-Parole Periods

209Counts 2, 6 and 12 each carry a standard non-parole period. It is necessary to keep in mind the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. In addition, I have regard to the provisions in s.54A and 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as amended recently by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Non-Parole Periods) Act 2013, those amendments being intended to clarify the role of the standard non-parole period in sentencing, following the decision in Muldrock v The Queen.

210The standard non-parole period is a guidepost to be taken into account, together with the maximum penalty, as part of the instinctive synthesis process. The Court must record reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period: s.54B(3). These remarks on sentence record my reasons for that purpose. 

211The Court is not required to record the extent to which the seriousness of the offence differs from that of an offence to which the standard non-parole period applies: s.54B(6).
 
Effects of Offences Upon the Surviving Victims

The Stiff Family

212James Stiff was operated on in hospital to repair damage to tendons, nerves and muscle. He also required a blood transfusion as a result of the amount of blood lost in the attack. It was found that the blow of the machete had caused the following injuries:

(a)compound division of the ulnar artery and nerve;

(b)division of the flexor tendon muscle to the fingers (used to flex the fingers);

(c)division of the flexor tendon muscle to the wrist (used to flex the wrist); and

(d)irregularity of the surface of the ulnar bone (one of the two forearm bones) indicating that the machete had impacted with the bone.

213James Stiff was released from hospital on 3 July 2010, but has ongoing difficulties as a consequence of his injuries.

214James Stiff gave evidence at the trial on 19 March 2013. He has a substantial scar to his left arm. He has only 10% strength in his left arm. Although he could move his left hand, the lower arm was numb. 

215It is apparent, for understandable reasons, that the terrifying memories of this event remain with him as well as the serious physical consequences of his injury. 

216A victim impact statement was made by James Stiff. It is apparent that he continues to experience the damaging physical and emotional consequences resulting from the invasion of his home. He described the serious and long-lasting psychological effects of this event. He referred, as well, to the detrimental effects of the offence upon his children, who were present at the time of these terrible events. The family could not remain at the house and moved to a different location.

217James Stiff referred, as well, to financial and other difficulties flowing from his inability to use his hand and the scarring of his arm. A report of Lubica Vrackar, psychologist, dated 22 December 2010 confirmed that James Stiff was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder with severe anxiety and depression.

218Kaerin Stiff gave evidence at the trial. It was apparent from his evidence that the memories of this event continue to trouble him, as well, in substantial ways. 

Tracey Burgess and the Burgess Family

219In the course of sentencing MA, Byquar and Ramos (at [137]ff) and Natuba and Tamapua (at [157]ff), I referred to the impact of these crimes upon Tracey Burgess and her family. 

220Since those sentencing remarks were given in December 2012, Tracey Burgess gave evidence at the trial, as did Kristal McLachlan. Tracey Burgess read a victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing relating to the present Offenders in August 2013. 

221It is appropriate that I repeat a number of observations made in my earlier remarks on sentence before proceeding to make some additional observations. 

222In the eyes of the law, Tracey Burgess is a victim in at least two ways. She is a direct victim of the armed robbery offence (Count 8). In addition, Tracey Burgess was a family victim of the murder of her son. 

223This is not a case where a member of the family of a deceased person learns of the event indirectly and after it has occurred. Rather, Tracey Burgess was present and observed the shocking events which took place in her house, culminating in the brutal killing of her son. 

224The evidence of Tracey Burgess at the trial required her to recount, in some detail, the events in her home on the evening of 1 July 2010. In addition to that account, as I have mentioned, the ""000"" calls made from the house were played in evidence. The tone and content of those calls provide powerful evidence of the horrific events which were still happening, or had just occurred. 

225In her evidence, and in the victim impact statement, Tracey Burgess gave a harrowing account of this dreadful night and its effects upon her family. The consequences of these events have been devastating.

226A report dated 19 September 2012 of Dr Sidney Lo confirms the understandable position that, as a result of the offences, Tracey Burgess experiences a high degree of stress, which has had a detrimental effect upon her physical health in a number of ways. 

227The substantial personal harm suffered by Tracey Burgess as the victim of an armed robbery offence is to be taken into account as a relevant factor in determining sentence on Count 8.

228I acknowledge the dreadful loss suffered by Tracey Burgess and the Burgess family, as a result of the death of Kesley and the impact of that loss, which will undoubtedly be life long. 

229I acknowledge, as well, the dignity displayed by Tracey Burgess on the frequent occasions when she attended Court during the course of the trial and sentencing proceedings.

230During the sentencing hearing, after Tracey Burgess had delivered her victim impact statement, I expressed the condolences of the Court and the community for the family's great loss. In these remarks on sentence, I once again express condolences on behalf of the community and the Court to the Burgess family.

231In passing sentence on the murder counts, I keep in mind the principles in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 84-87.

232It is appropriate, as well, to acknowledge the impact of this crime upon Kristal McLachlan, the partner of Kesley Burgess at the time of his death. Her evidence during the trial, and the content of the ""000"" calls, stand as testimony to the ordeal to which she was subjected on this night.

Maxine Rogers and her Children

233Maxine Rogers gave evidence at the trial. In addition, a ""000"" call was played in which, in a state of great upset, she sought help after her home had been invaded.

234Although no victim impact statement was made by or on behalf of Maxine Rogers, an inference should be drawn that the invasion of her home by armed men brandishing meat cleavers constituted a terrifying experience for her and her two young daughters.

Subjective Circumstances of the Offenders

Khoury

235Khoury was 29 years old at the time of the offences and is now 33 years old. A presentence report was obtained with respect to Khoury and a report dated 24 September 2013 of Mr Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist, was tendered on sentence.

236The reports reveal that Khoury was born in Sydney in 1980. He is of Lebanese Christian background and has two elder sisters. He completed his Higher School Certificate. During the final two years at school, Khoury commenced part-time participation in a TAFE course and, after leaving school, he completed a certificate in information technology. His employment history has involved work in cement rendering and then a number of small businesses dealing in computers, cement rendering, hardware and shops wholesaling mixed goods.

237Khoury is a single man who had been in a relationship with an 18-year old partner, Walsh, at the time of his arrest in September 2010. He has no children.

238Khoury has no history of alcohol or drug abuse. He has no history of physical or mental ill health.

239The author of the presentence report noted that Khoury had been afforded the luxury of a stable, uneventful childhood and adulthood, and that he continued to receive the support of various family members, including his mother. His father had passed away, after a long illness, in mid-2013. 

240His criminal record is confined to an offence of driving whilst suspended in 2009, with the Local Court dismissing the charge under s.10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

241Psychometric testing by Mr Watson-Munro did not reveal any aspect which bears upon the question of sentence. Understandably, Mr Watson-Munro concluded that Khoury was experiencing depression and anxiety as he awaited sentence.

242The presentence report indicates that Khoury is managed as a protection-limited association inmate at Parklea Correctional Centre due to concerns regarding his safety from outlaw motorcycle gangs. He has been the subject of two institutional misconduct charges, one for fighting in May 2011 (confined to cells for five days) and one for unlawful use of a phone or fax in August 2011 (no telephone calls permitted for 14 days).

243The presentence report records that, from the time of Khoury's entry into custody in September 2010 until August 2011, he was regularly seen by psychological staff, with this monthly contact primarily focused on monitoring his coping and adjustment in the correctional centre environment. Following the recent death of his father, he was again assessed and he advised that he did not require any ongoing contact at present.

Karimi

244Karimi was born in Afghanistan in 1988, and was aged 22 years at the time of the offences. He is now 25 years old. He is a single man with no children.

245A presentence report was prepared with respect to Karimi. In addition, a report dated 2 September 2013 of Dr Gerald Chew, consultant psychiatrist with Justice Health, was provided to the Court. This report was based upon a document examination, as Karimi had declined to be examined by Dr Chew. Dr Chew gave oral evidence at the sentencing hearing on 25 September 2013. In the course of that evidence, further documents were tendered by the Crown and counsel for Karimi relating to mental health issues (Sentencing Exhibits G, H and 6). I will return to this material shortly. 

246Also tendered in the defence case were statements of Zainab Karimi, a sister of the Offender, and material concerning the health of the Offender's mother, Zahra Karimi. 

247The Karimi family, consisting of the parents and six children, arrived in Australia in October 1999. Karimi is the second eldest of the six children. 

248Karimi attended high school until Year 10, leaving in 2004. At about that time, his parents had separated and this had a significant effect upon the Offender. The father moved from the area and the children lived with the mother in Auburn. 

249According to Zainab Karimi, the Offender helped at home following his leaving school in 2004. He was unable to find work and, after about a year, enrolled at Bankstown Senior College to complete his Higher School Certificate. He attended college for about a year and did not finish the course. In about 2006, he obtained work in a chocolate and foodstuff factory, where he worked for about a year. He then worked casually as a general hand in smash repair and mechanical workshops in Chester Hill and Blacktown for about 18 months.

250Some time in 2009, Karimi ceased working and remained at home, being in receipt of Centrelink payments whilst assisting with his mother who was ill. The evidence indicates that Karimi's mother continues to have significant health difficulties.

251Zainab Karimi states that the family in Australia has about 150 members and that family members have regularly visited Karimi in custody. The presentence report confirms that Karimi has received regular institutional visits from his mother, father and siblings, as well as visits from other family and friends. 

252Karimi has a limited criminal history. On 2 April 2008, he was sentenced in the Parramatta Local Court for offences of possession of an unregistered firearm, failing to surrender a firearm and possession of a firearm or barrel which had been altered or defaced. He was fined a total of $1,500.00 and was placed on a good behaviour bond for 12 months. The facts of these offences have been placed before the Court. In January 2008, Karimi had an argument with his mother. He was observed by a member of the family to have placed a bag in the roof of their dwelling. His mother and sisters located the bag and discovered that it contained a pistol and a quantity of ammunition, together with a rifle magazine. Members of the family contacted police and Karimi was arrested and charged with these offences. He told police that he had found the firearm and ammunition some months earlier.

253Following an examination of Justice Health records, Dr Chew provided a limited report to the Court. He noted that Karimi had declined to be interviewed on 21 August 2013 and that this continued to be the case. 

254Dr Chew noted that Karimi had no previous psychiatric admissions or contact with a mental health service prior to his arrest in 2010. 

255Following his arrest in July 2010, Karimi was referred for an assessment for anxiety and depression. He reported hearing a voice, but there was no objective evidence of auditory hallucinations and he was diagnosed with situational crisis. Karimi was reviewed again in December 2010, and it was determined that his presentation was considered secondary to situational crisis and there was no major mental health diagnosis. 

256He was referred for assessment again on 24 July 2012, complaining of sleep disturbances and difficulties in custody including frequent arguments with correctional officers. On assessment, it was concluded that his behaviour was more suggestive of antisocial personality disorder, with depressive symptoms which were exacerbated by incarceration, and he was prescribed antidepressant medication.

257Dr Chew was cross-examined by the Crown concerning a range of entries in the Justice Health records concerning Karimi. Dr Chew agreed that Karimi appeared to have been using amphetamines at times in custody and that his statement to persons from time to time in 2013 reflected an understanding of the proceedings against him. 

258On 4 September 2013, an order was made under s.55(1) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 directing that Karimi be transferred to a mental health facility as he was by then a mentally ill person.

259From the information which he had gathered, Dr Chew considered that Karimi had a significant history of psychiatric illness and polysubstance abuse. Dr Chew observed that it was possible that Karimi could have had an untreated psychotic illness for some months or even years, although this was less likely given the number of psychiatric reviews prior to 2013 where psychosis was not diagnosed. Dr Chew observed that his recent deterioration could be precipitated by the escalating stress over his upcoming sentencing. 

260Counsel for Karimi acknowledged that there was no evidence that Karimi was suffering from any mental illness at the time of the commission of the offences. The evidence does not point to any mental health issues affecting Karimi at that time. Further, the evidence of his involvement in these various crimes does not suggest that he was affected by any mental disorder. 

261Caution must be exercised in reaching any conclusion concerning Karimi's mental state since he has been in custody. Psychiatric assessments made prior to 2013 suggest situational stress and antisocial personality disorder as being significant components. 

262Particular caution is required in making findings concerning Karimi in 2013. He has refused to be examined by Dr Chew. There are contemporaneous notes which indicate that, at various times during 2013, Karimi had been consuming illegal drugs which may have affected his condition. Further, as the Crown submits, there are a range of entries in those records which indicate a comprehension on his part of the proceedings then on foot against him. It was my observation during the trial that Karimi followed the proceedings and understood evidence being given and submissions being made.

263In my view, the appropriate finding is that Karimi's condition has become exacerbated as the sentencing process proceeded in and after July 2013. It is appropriate to take into account the fact that Karimi is now being treated for a psychiatric condition in passing sentence upon him. However, compliance and co-operation on his part with treatment would likely see improvement in his mental state, so that this factor will be of limited assistance to him on sentence.

Mir

264Mir was born in Afghanistan in 1990. He was 20 years old at the time of the offences. He is now 23 years of age. 

265A presentence report was prepared for the sentencing proceedings. In addition, a report dated 2 August 2013 from Ms Anna Robilliard, psychologist, was tendered in the defence case. A statement of Masoma Mir, a sister of the Offender, was also placed before the Court. 

266Mir was born in Afghanistan, the youngest in a family of seven children. Mir's mother died when he was a young child. His father remarried and a decision was made for the family to leave Afghanistan. 

267The family belonged to the Hazaras minority ethnic group and are Shiite Muslims. Hazaras were subjected to persecution by the Taliban. 

268In the late 1990s, the family moved to the Pakistani city of Peshawar, where they remained for several years, before being accepted as migrants to Australia in 2001. 

269Mir's father and his second wife had three further children by the time they came to Australia, with a further child being born since then. 

270Mir's father was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2004 (at the age of 54), when Mir was 14 years old. Thereafter, Mir's elder brother took responsibility for looking after the family. The documentary evidence indicates that Mir was affected adversely by the death of his father and the reduced stability within the family. 

271Mir is a single man with no children.

272Mir attended a local high school and completed Year 10. Subsequently, he obtained a position as an apprentice panel beater. He had completed three years of his apprenticeship at the time of his arrest in July 2010. 

273Mir informed the author of the presentence report that he had been a regular consumer of alcohol and cannabis, and had tried cocaine but did not particularly like it. He had never tried drugs such as amphetamines or opiates. 

274Mir has a limited criminal history. In July 2005, he was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond in the Children's Court for an offence of aggravated break and enter whilst in company. He had been caught with another young person inside the garage of a residential unit block at Lidcombe. In November 2008, he was fined and placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond in the Local Court for offences of larceny and traffic offences. Other traffic offences had been dealt with by way of fine in October 2008.

275The presentence report recorded the following with respect to Mir's associates:

""It would appear that Mr Mir's present offences are a direct result of his association with a gang, which existed to engage in violent criminal activity and required active participation of its members. In discussing how he became involved with the group, he said that he had met other members through his cousin, who was already a key member. Regarding his prior relationship with his cousin, he said that they used to live in the same area and 'would sometimes hang out together'.""

276The author of the presentence report noted that Mir had fully co-operated in the preparation of the report. It was difficult to assess his level of remorse given Mir's reluctance to discuss the offences themselves. 

277Given his limited criminal antecedents, however, it was said that it ""appears that he would have been unlikely to have become involved in these matters, were it not for his gang associations and loyalties"". The author considered that Mir had the ""potential to learn from his grievous mistakes and to respond positively to opportunities to address his offending behaviour and to realise his potential"". 

278It was proposed that an individual case-management plan be developed during the classification process, which may include participation in the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program. 

279Mir has taken advantage of employment opportunities whilst in custody working in different capacities as a storeman, a furniture maker and as a sweeper. He has made clear his intention to pursue vocational opportunities and further education and training whilst in custody.

280Mir informed Ms Robilliard that he had associated with Karimi for some time and that he and Karimi occasionally smoked cannabis together. He said that he did not see Karimi on regular occasions and that their meetings were usually precipitated by a phone call from Karimi.

281Ms Robilliard undertook certain psychological testing. His perceptual reasoning score indicated that he was at the middle of the average range. 

282Ms Robilliard raised the possibility that family and environmental circumstances had exposed Mir to traumatic events, in particular in Afghanistan. The death of his father in Australia during his teenage years had a negative effect, with Mir using drugs and alcohol and associating with antisocial peers. Ms Robilliard noted Mir's desire to further his education whilst in custody and considered that he would benefit, as well, from psychotherapy and involvement in violent offender programs. 

Sentences Imposed Upon Co-Offenders

283My remarks on sentence with respect to MA, Byquar, Ramos, Natuba and Tamapua disclose the sentences imposed upon each of those offenders, as well as sentences imposed upon Vergara, Bautista and CB in the District Court (R v MA; R v Byquar; R v Ramos at [149]-[172]). It is not necessary to recite those sentences in these remarks. 

284In sentencing the present Offenders, I will have regard to the principles of parity and proportionality of sentence to the extent that they are applicable. However, considerable caution must be exercised in considering these factors in this case. 

285Firstly, the present Offenders were convicted after trial. Unlike all other offenders dealt with so far, there will be no allowance for pleas of guilty or assistance to the authorities. Further, I am not satisfied that any of the present Offenders have demonstrated contrition or remorse. 

286Secondly, as the sentencing remarks in the District Court and this Court make clear, a number of the other offenders had matters taken into account on a Form 1 on sentence. The present Offenders are to be sentenced for separate offences for which each of them were convicted by the jury.

287Thirdly, there are important differences in the offences for which the present Offenders are to be sentenced, as opposed to other offenders who pleaded guilty. In particular, Khoury and Karimi are to be sentenced for conspiracy to murder (Count 9). This offence is significantly more serious than the charges under s.33B Crimes Act 1900 for which Tamapua and Vergara were sentenced.

288Fourthly, I have kept in mind that the criminal histories of the present Offenders are less substantial than those of other offenders who have been sentenced previously for offences arising out of these events (with the exception of Ramos, Vergara and Walsh who had no prior criminal history). 

289Fifthly, two of the offenders, MA and CB, were juvenile offenders, so that different sentencing considerations had some application in their cases. 

290A number of the limitations referred to in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at 589 [203] have direct application in these circumstances. The differences which I have recited indicate a number of significant practical difficulties, in comparing sentences previously imposed, with those to be passed on each of the present Offenders: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 473-474 [30]. 

291With these very significant qualifications, I have kept in mind issues of parity and proportionality for the purpose of sentencing each of the present Offenders.

Home Invasion Offences

292Each of the offences committed on 29 June 2010 and 1 July 2010 involved home invasions. In the course of sentencing MA, Byquar, Ramos, Natuba and Tamapua, I made a number of observations concerning the gravity and dangerousness of this class of offence (R v Natuba; R v Tamapua at [235]-[240]).

293Courts in this State have observed that home invasion offences are frequently committed by young men. In R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, Lee CJ at CL (Gleeson CJ and Hunt J agreeing) observed at 135 that home invasion offences were crimes of great gravity, which were ""becoming all too frequent"". His Honour continued at 135:

""Day and night people live in fear and terror of being assaulted and robbed in their own homes. Frequently this class of offence along with robberies of commercial premises are committed by persons who have barely entered upon manhood. Whilst the early background of each respondent merits sympathy and understanding it can not be used to cloak or disguise the fact that the actions of the respondents and the other men involved can only properly be described as the actions of a gang of thugs and armed thugs at that, violently invading the home of the victims and rendering them helpless.

It is true that Courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal Court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes.""

294The Court of Criminal Appeal has emphasised more recently the need for an appropriate level of punishment in the case of the forced invasion of a home by armed men, in the middle of the night, with terror being inflicted on the occupants, even where allowance is to be made for an offender's youth and troubled adolescence: R v Murrell [2012] NSWCCA 90 at [55]. Offending of this type involves, amongst other things, an invasion of the privacy of the victims: Haines v R [2012] NSWCCA 238 at [62].

295The unpredictable and chaotic nature of home invasions, with the real prospect of serious injury or worse resulting, has been emphasised: Wahl v State of Tasmania [2012] TASCCA 5 at [30]. 

296The offences committed by the present Offenders involved directly (in the case of Mir) or indirectly (in the cases of Khoury and Karimi), young men being engaged in brutal and frightening activities, whilst armed with a machete and a firearm (on 29 July 2010) and with meat cleavers (on 1 July 2010), in circumstances which were likely (at the least) to instil great fear in those whose homes were invaded, with the distinct prospect that an occupant (on the spur of the moment) may decide to resist, even though outnumbered by the armed invaders.

297The tragic events which occurred in the Burgess house, not long after the frightening circumstances affecting James Stiff and then Maxine Rogers, illustrate the nature and risks of offending of this type.

A Broad Hierarchy of Offenders

298Counsel made submissions concerning a type of hierarchy of offenders for the purpose of fact finding on sentence. Care must be taken in attaching labels to persons engaged in criminal activity. However, the evidence at trial, as recited in the factual findings narrated earlier, permit such a process in this case. 

299I am satisfied that Khoury should be placed appropriately as the head of the criminal group. He was engaged in a drug supply operation with Karimi, before meeting Tamapua. Khoury wished to remove competitors in the drug trade to expand his own operation. Having met Tamapua in a drug supply context, Khoury was clearly impressed by the potential for Tamapua and his group of violent young men to be deployed to advance Khoury's interests. As mentioned earlier, counsel for Khoury submitted that the evidence revealed that it was Wally who was the head of the organisation, in a position superior to Khoury. The evidence indicates that Wally played some role in these activities. However, it was Khoury who recruited Tamapua (and his young criminal associates). It was Khoury who caused Natuba to be recruited on 1 July 2010. It was Khoury who caused Unasa to be recruited on 3 July 2010. As the factual narrative makes clear, it was Khoury's home and his shop which were used as the locations for meetings, and as points of departure and return for the home invaders on 29 June 2010 and 1 July 2010. 

300It is the case that Tamapua was a violent criminal who himself led a group of young violent criminals. Tamapua was undoubtedly a strong personality, which was projected clearly to the jury during his extended period in the witness box. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that it was Khoury who was the leader and director of criminal activities engaged in by the various offenders I have mentioned between 29 June 2010 and 4 July 2010. It served the interests of Khoury to join forces with Tamapua and his group. Thereafter, those involved in these criminal activities met at Khoury's premises - his home at Villawood or his shop at Chester Hill. This was the case before and after the offences on 29 June 2010 and 1 July 2010. A further meeting took place involving Unasa on 3 July 2010. Tamapua may be characterised appropriately as an ally of Khoury during this short but violent period of serious crime. However, I do not accept the submission of counsel for Khoury that there was a type of ""power shift"" from Khoury to Tamapua as events progressed from 29 June 2010 to 4 July 2010.

301Although Tamapua played a senior role in the group, bringing to bear specialised violent skills desired by Khoury, it was Khoury who was the leader of the group. 

302Karimi played a significant organisational role in the activities giving rise to these offences. He was involved in drug supply with Khoury and performed critical functions in the offences of 29 June 2010 and 1 July 2010. He is to be placed appropriately at the second tier of the hierarchy, as a senior assistant to Khoury.

303Karimi was associated with Khoury in his drug supply enterprise before Tamapua came on the scene. Karimi played an integral role in Khoury's organisation, although he did not enter premises himself or place himself at direct risk of injury. I accept the Crown submission that Karimi held a position of trusted lieutenant to Khoury. I am satisfied, as well, that it was Karimi who played a direct role in the recruitment of his cousin, Mir, to become involved in the crimes committed on the evening of 1 July 2010.

304Mir and others were the foot soldiers who carried out home invasions. To so describe them is not to minimise their role and responsibility. It was they who wreaked havoc and terrified persons, using force, including lethal force. 

Determining the Appropriate Sentences

305I have referred to a range of objective and subjective factors to be considered on sentence with respect to each of the present Offenders. It is necessary now to undertake the process of instinctive synthesis for the purpose of passing sentence.

306I will keep in mind, as statutory guideposts, the maximum penalty for each offence and applicable standard non-parole periods. 

307It is necessary, as well, that the Court determine an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality with respect to each Offender.

308The aggregation of all sentences for each Offender is to constitute a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved: R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 164 [15]. Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending: R v Knight [2005] NSWCCA 253; 155 A Crim R 252 at 272 [112]; R v MAK at 164-165 [18]. At times, sentencing courts speak of avoidance of the imposition of a ""crushing"" sentence in the context of totality. However, as Grove J (Campbell JA and myself agreeing) observed in Ta'ala v R [2008] NSWCCA 132 at [42], the concept of a ""crushing"" sentence does not articulate some applicable test. In the case of multiple serious crimes, the imposition of a very lengthy sentence will be necessary as the just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved.

309In Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; 219 A Crim R 104 at 132 [215], with the concurrence of Tobias AJA and Hall J, I said:

""An assessment whether a particular sentence is a 'crushing sentence' must have regard to the offence or offences committed by the offender, the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods relevant to those offences, and all objective and subjective factors which should be appropriately brought into account on sentence, together with principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality. As Grove J observed in Ta'ala v R at [42], 'justice is individual and each offence and each offender requires assessment'.""

310I have kept these principles in mind in considering issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. 

311Issues of specific deterrence and general deterrence are most important considerations on sentence for these offences. 

Khoury

312I have referred already to the role of Khoury in these various offences. It was Khoury who provided the impetus for Count 1, with his particular desire to obtain the Desert Eagle firearm (amongst other weapons). Count 2 involved a home invasion to further Khoury's plan, with serious injury being inflicted upon James Stiff. Khoury played a key organisational role in the launching and return of the home invaders, whilst maintaining telephone contact with Tuki who reported to him the serious injury resulting from that crime.

313Count 4 involved the recruitment of Natuba to participate in the terrible crimes on 1 July 2010. 

314Counts 5, 6 and 8 involved a separate wave of home invaders departing from Khoury's shop, and returning there with clear evidence of the violence which had been inflicted. Although Khoury did not travel to the scene of the home invasions, he was well aware of what was to happen and participated in these crimes in a manner which made him liable for them. 

315Count 9 involved Khoury participating again in a course of planned violent conduct even though he was well aware of the direct consequences of earlier offences, including the death of Kesley Burgess. Khoury's motivation to commit the crime contained in Count 9 arose from the solidarity of the criminal group of violent men who, by that time, were working with and for him. 

316Count 12 involved possession by Khoury of the shortened .22 calibre long rifle at his home in the period spanned by these crimes. 

317Khoury's crimes reflect very great objective gravity. Like Tamapua, the fact that he did not enter the houses does not place his moral culpability any lower than those who did enter premises (R v Natuba; R v Tamapua at [233]). Given his command position, Khoury's moral culpability was great indeed.

318I have taken into account Khoury's subjective circumstances and his effective absence of prior convictions. He was 29 years old at the time of these offences, and had determined to turn to substantial drug supply as an activity, involving the ready use of violence. 

319His prior history ought suggest that there are reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. However, the fact that a man in his position and at his age chose to embark upon very serious criminal activity of this type, must require caution before a favourable assessment of prospects of rehabilitation can be made.

320There is nothing in Khoury's background which operates in his favour on sentence nor is there any medical or other evidence which bears upon the issue, with the exception of an understandable level of depression in the circumstances in which he now finds himself.

321I accept the Crown submission with respect to issues of accumulation and concurrency that:

(a)the sentence for Count 12 may appropriately be served concurrently with the sentences to be imposed for Counts 1 and 9, both of which involve the use of the firearm in significant ways;

(b)the sentence for Count 4 may be served concurrently with sentences to be served for Counts 5, 6 and 8, being the other offences being committed on 1 July 2010;

(c)partial accumulation of sentences is appropriate for other offences, given the separate offences and victims contained in Counts 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9.

322A finding of special circumstances will be made to give effect to the accumulation of sentences to be passed upon him. The effective non-parole period represents the minimum period he should serve in custody for all his crimes, having regard to all the purposes of sentencing. The balance of term to be set will provide ample opportunity for conditional liberty to assist his return to the community upon release. 

323The sentence will commence from the date of his arrest on 29 September 2010. 

Karimi

324I have made findings concerning the role of Karimi in the offences for which he is to be sentenced. 

325Karimi's involvement in Counts 1 and 2 arose from his pre-existing criminal association with Khoury, and his willingness to provide a range of organisational and operational support for the crimes committed on those occasions. 

326With respect to Counts 5, 6 and 8, Karimi maintained these significant levels of organisational and operational support, with the critical addition of the identification of the Burgess house at Lurnea as the target for the home invasion which culminated in the murder of Kesley Burgess.

327Count 9 involved Karimi in the continuation of significant organisational and operational support for members of Khoury's group, when called to arms to assist Byquar in the planned violent confrontation at Miller. It was only the interception of the vehicle containing Karimi and others by police that prevented the confrontation which was intended to occur.

328Count 11 arises from Karimi's possession of the firearm. This offence is closely tied to the offence in Count 9.

329Karimi's crimes also reflect great objective gravity. His moral culpability is substantial.

330I take into account Karimi's subjective circumstances. He has a limited criminal history. He has no history of mental disorder which operated at the time of the commission of these offences so as to affect his moral culpability for these grave crimes. However, as indicated earlier, I accept for the purpose of sentence, that the sentences of imprisonment may be more onerous at the present time, because of his current mental condition. I bear in mind, however, that the treatment of Karimi in custody ought become simpler if he co-operates with Justice Health and adopts a different approach to that seen in his dealing with Dr Chew. It should not be concluded that Karimi's imprisonment will be more onerous for him in the long term. The evidence does not support such a finding.

331There is no contrition or remorse on Karimi's part. An assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation is difficult. The Court is not in a position to form a favourable view with respect to his prospects of rehabilitation.

332I accept the Crown submission and am satisfied that partially accumulated sentences are appropriate in the case of Karimi, with the exception of the sentence for Count 11, which should be made entirely concurrent with the sentence for Count 9. 

333A finding of special circumstances should be made by reason of the accumulation of sentences. The effective non-parole period to be fixed represents the minimum period Karimi should serve in custody for all his crimes, having regard to all the purposes of sentencing. The balance of term to be set will provide adequate time by way of conditional liberty to assist his return to the community upon release.

334The sentences should commence from the date of his arrest on 4 July 2010.

Mir

335Mir's involvement with the criminal group began and ended on 1 July 2010. He was recruited to the group by his cousin, Karimi.

336Unlike Khoury and Karimi, Mir did not persist in further crimes beyond the terrible events of 1 July 2010. However, he was one of the young men who entered the Rogers and Burgess homes, and who played a direct part in the murder of Kesley Burgess. 

337The objective gravity of Mir's offences is high.

338I take into account Mir's subjective circumstances. The evidence indicates that he was subjected to a level of trauma as a child in Afghanistan, followed by family instability upon the death of his father in Australia. However, it was Mir who made the fateful decision to take up Karimi's suggestion that he become involved in the criminal group, ignoring the sensible advice of Eliza Brown. No pressure was placed on him to take this course.

339Mir has a limited criminal history. There are signs in the evidence before the Court on sentence that there are prospects for his rehabilitation. He has demonstrated a capacity to work in custody, and has expressed a clear intention to further his education and training to make productive use of what will be a lengthy period in prison. However, he has expressed no contrition or remorse.

340Once again, I accept the Crown submission that there ought be a level of accumulation for each of Counts 5, 6 and 8. Each offence involves a separate victim. The fact that the offences were committed relatively close in time ought not lead to the imposition of entirely concurrent sentences. 

341Although Count 6 and 8 were both committed in the Burgess household very close in time, there was a separate attack and threats to Tracey Burgess in addition to the fatal attack upon Kesley Burgess. 

342A finding of special circumstances should be made by reason of accumulation of sentences. As with the other Offenders, the effective non-parole period will represent the minimum term he should serve in custody for his crimes, having regard to all the purposes of sentencing. The balance of term will provide adequate time by way of conditional liberty to assist his return to the community upon release.

343His sentence will commence from the date of his arrest on 22 July 2010.

371I am obliged to tell each of you of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, which applies to ""serious violence offences"" including the offence of murder and other offences for which you have been sentenced. In summary, this means that the State can apply to the Supreme Court for an order that you continue to receive supervision or be held in detention at the end of your sentence, if the Court considers that you would be a ""high risk offender"" who poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence. It is therefore in the interests of each of you to engage in rehabilitation opportunities that may be offered to you in the course of your sentence.

		29 November 2013",2013-11-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762865,Attorney General of New South Wales v Air Conditioning Engineering Services Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCCA 300,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: This is an appeal brought by the Attorney General of New South Wales (the Attorney) pursuant to s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against an order made by Curtis DCJ (the primary judge) dismissing two summonses brought against the respondent, Air Conditioning Engineering Services Pty Ltd (ACE), alleging contraventions of s 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (OH&S Act).

2The appeal was heard at the same time as the appeal by the Attorney against similar orders of the primary judge in respect of which judgment has been delivered today: Attorney General of New South Wales v Built NSW Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCCA 299 (the Built proceedings).

3On 25 May 2012 Blanch J (Chief Judge of the District Court of New South Wales) granted applications under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (CPA) and made orders that ACE appear to answer the charges. The prosecutor was named as Inspector Melinda Walsh. However, the applications and the statements of facts were signed by David Hall, who was described in the same way as he was described in the applications and statements of facts in respect of the similar offences alleged against Built NSW Pty Ltd. I have referred to the manner in which Mr Hall was described in my judgment in the Built proceedings.

4The first summons described the offence in the following terms:

""Air Conditioning Engineering Services Pty Limited [ACN 122 466 693] a corporation with its registered office situated at 10 Bridge Road, Stanmore in the State of New South Wales ('the defendant'), being an employer, on 27 May 2010, at 401-411 Sussex Street, Haymarket in the State of New South Wales ('the site') failed by its acts and/or omissions particularised in Annexure A (attached) to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of persons other than its employees, and in particular Dean Pulver contrary to section 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.""

The second summons was in the same terms apart from naming different individuals, Mr Jamie Zonno and Mr Joshua Jiminez, in relation to the alleged contravention.

5By notice of motion filed in the District Court on 14 September 2012, ACE sought orders quashing the application to commence proceedings and dismissing the summons. The grounds relied on were generally the same as those relied on by Built NSW Pty Ltd in its application.

6The primary judge dismissed each summons for the reasons given by him in the Built proceedings.

7The Attorney has appealed from this judgment pursuant to s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

8The grounds of appeal raised by the Attorney in this appeal are the same as those raised by him in the Built proceedings. In addition, ACE has filed what is described as a notice of contention in the same form as that filed by Built NSW Pty Ltd in the Built proceedings.

9I have set out the legislative background and summarised the judgment of the primary judge in my judgment in the Built proceedings.

The submissions of the parties

(a) The Attorney

10The Attorney made the same submissions as were made by him in the Build proceedings.

(b) ACE

11ACE adopted the written and oral submissions made by Built NSW Pty Ltd in the Build proceedings. It submitted that the proceedings were not instituted by a person authorised to do so and submitted that each summons was void, first, on the basis that the applications and statements of facts did not comply with s 246(2) of the CPA and Pt 53 r 26 of the District Court Rules 1973 and, second, because they did not allege any offence known to law.

12ACE pointed out that in her affidavit sworn 21 September 2012, Inspector Walsh did not state that she had determined to institute proceedings alleging the particular offences charged, nor that she had instructed Mr Hall to make the applications, had approved them or was even aware that Mr Hall would make them.

13ACE submitted that the significant responsibility to issue proceedings was only given to certain persons, including an inspector. It pointed to the significant penalties which could result from conviction for offences under the OH&S Act. It submitted that the legislation did not authorise a person other than an inspector to lay the charges.

14ACE also submitted the failure of Inspector Walsh to sign the application resulted in it not being in the approved form. It submitted that the rules did not adopt the extended definition of prosecutor in s 3 of the CPA. It submitted that the non-compliance with s 246(2) of the CPA and r 26 of the District Court Rules constituted a direct route to the proposition that the Court had no jurisdiction to determine the proceedings: John Holland Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 338; (2010) 202 IR 82 at [46]-[47].

15Senior counsel for ACE submitted that the onus was on the prosecutor to prove that the proceedings were authorised by Inspector Walsh and that it failed to do so. He submitted that even if the affidavit of Inspector Walsh had shown that the prosecutor had presented Mr Hall with the facts and requested him to lay charges, that would not be sufficient. However, he emphasised that the evidence did not go so far.

16Senior counsel for ACE submitted that the conclusion that non-compliance with the requirement in the rules that the applications be signed by the prosecutor led to invalidity was consistent with the need to identify the persons responsible for bringing the charges given their serious nature.

Consideration

(a) The appeal

17The issues raised in the appeal are identical to those in the Built proceedings. For the reasons given in those proceedings, the appeal should be dismissed.

(b) The notice of contention

18The first summons in this case and the particulars thereto were in the following terms:





""Description of Offence:




















Date of Offence:

Place of Offence:

27 May 2010

401-411 Sussex Street, Haymarket NSW 2000

Attached as 'Annexure A'




Section 8(2) Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.

42014

'Annexure A'(Particulars regarding DEAN PULVER)

(1) The Defendant was at all material times an employer.

(2) The Defendant's place of work was the site.

(3) The Defendant's undertaking at the site included the procurement, manufacture, supply, delivery and installation of materials which included air handling units, air conditioning units, cooling towers, refrigeration machines, fans and motors.

(4) Dean Pulver was not an employee of the Defendant.

(5) Due to the Defendant's failings as particularised below, Dean Pulver was placed at risk of falling from height.

(6) In particular, Mr Pulver was exposed to the risk of:

(a) falling from a work area on top of the lift/fire stair over run on level 8 of the site referred to as the 'lift lid';

(b) falling from a stepladder situated on top of the lift lid whilst placing a lifting strap around an overhead metal girder.

(7) The particulars of the acts or omissions of the Defendant are:

AI The Defendant failed to ensure the lift lid was made safe by secure perimeter screens, fencing, handrails or other forms of physical barriers that were capable of preventing Mr Pulver being placed at risk of falling from the lift lid;

A2 The Defendant failed to ensure Bravo Industries Pty Limited provided to Built NSW Pty Limited a safe work method statement which specifically addressed working from the top of the lift lid;

A3 The Defendant failed to ensure that Dean Pulver was inducted into a safe work method statement applicable to working on top of the lift lid;

B1 The Defendant failed to ensure that Bravo Industries provided a safe work method statement which specifically addressed the task of moving equipment onto the lift lid;

B2 The Defendant failed to ensure that Dean Pulver was inducted into a safe work method statement applicable to the task of moving equipment onto the lift lid;

C1 The Defendant failed to provide any supervision of Bravo Payroll employees on 27 May 2010.

(8) As a result of the failures set out in A and C Dean Pulver was placed at risk of injury.

(9) As a result of the failures set out in B and C Dean Pulver was placed at risk of injury and sustained injuries as a result of a fall, which fall was a manifestation of the fall risk.""

The second summons and particulars attached as Annexure A were in similar terms in relation to different individuals, Mr Zonno and Mr Jiminez.

19Although the factual particulars are different to those in the Built proceedings, the charges suffer from the same deficiency as identified in my judgment in those proceedings. It follows that they do not disclose any offence known to law and the defects are not ones to which s 16(2) of the CPA would apply. The summonses were liable to be set aside on this ground as well as the grounds identified by the primary judge.

Conclusion

20The appeal should be dismissed.

21BEAZLEY P: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

22HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

		03 December 2013",2013-12-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762876,Attorney General of New South Wales v Built NSW Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCCA 299,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: This is an appeal brought by the Attorney General of New South Wales (the Attorney) pursuant to s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against an order made by Curtis DCJ (the primary judge) dismissing two summonses brought against Built NSW Pty Ltd (the respondent) alleging contraventions of s 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (OH&S Act).

2On 29 May 2012 Blanch J (Chief Judge of the District Court of New South Wales) granted two applications to commence proceedings under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (CPA) and made orders that the respondent appear before the District Court to answer the charges. The prosecutor named in the applications, the summonses and the statements of facts which accompanied them, was Inspector Melinda Walsh. 

3The applications were signed by David Hall who was described as ""Solicitor representing the prosecutor"". The statements of facts were signed by Mr Hall as ""Solicitor representing the prosecutor applying for an order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986"".

4The first summons described the offence in the following terms:

""Built NSW Pty Limited [ACN 083 928 045] a corporation with its registered office situated at Level 1, 140 Myrtle Street, Chippendale in the State of New South Wales ('the defendant'), being an employer, on 27 May 2010, at 401-411 Sussex Street, Haymarket in the State of New South Wales ('the site') failed by its acts and/or omissions particularised in Annexure A (attached) to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of persons other than its employees, and in particular Jamie Zonno and Joshua Ziminez contrary to section 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.""

The second summons was in the same terms apart from naming a different individual, Mr Dean Pulver, in relation to the alleged contravention.

5By notices of motion filed on 17 August 2012, the respondent sought orders quashing the applications to commence proceedings and each summons. The respondent relied upon two grounds, first, that the proceedings were instituted by a person who was not authorised to do so and, second, that each summons did not allege an offence known to law.

6The matter was heard by the primary judge on 15 November 2012 and judgment delivered on 29 November 2012. His Honour upheld the first ground relied upon by the respondent and dismissed each summons. He indicated that he would not have upheld the second ground as although he found the summons was defective, he held it was capable of amendment. He did not determine whether it was appropriate to grant leave to amend.

7The Attorney pursuant to s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act appeals against the conclusion of the primary judge on the first ground. By what was described as a notice of contention, the respondent contends that the primary judge erred in concluding that any defect in each summons was capable of being cured by amendment.

The relevant legislation

8The first issue raised in the appeal falls for consideration against the following legislative background.

9The provision, the subject of the charges in the present case, is s 8 of the OH&S Act (now repealed). At the time of the alleged offences it provided:

""8(1) Employees

An employer must ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all the employees of the employer. 

That duty extends (without limitation) to the following: 

(a) ensuring that any premises controlled by the employer where the employees work (and the means of access to or exit from the premises) are safe and without risks to health,

(b) ensuring that any plant or substance provided for use by the employees at work is safe and without risks to health when properly used,

(c) ensuring that systems of work and the working environment of the employees are safe and without risks to health,

(d) providing such information, instruction, training and supervision as may be necessary to ensure the employees' health and safety at work,

(e) providing adequate facilities for the welfare of the employees at work.

(2) Others at workplace

An employer must ensure that people (other than the employees of the employer) are not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the employer's undertaking while they are at the employer's place of work.""

10Section 106 of the OH&S Act dealt with the power to institute proceedings for an offence under that Act. It provided as follows:

""106(1) Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be instituted only: 

(a) with the written consent of a Minister of the Crown, or

(b) with the written consent of an officer prescribed by the regulations, or

(c) by an inspector, or

(d) by the secretary of an industrial organisation of employees any member or members of which are concerned in the matter to which the proceedings relate.

(2) In proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations, a consent to institute the proceedings, purporting to have been signed by a Minister or a prescribed officer, is evidence of that consent without proof of the signature of the Minister or prescribed officer.""

11The procedure for instituting prosecutions for such offences is to be found in s 246 of the CPA:

""246(1) A prosecutor may apply for an order:

(a) that a person alleged in the application to have committed an offence that may be dealt with summarily by the court must appear at a time and place specified in the order to answer to the offence charged in the order, or

(b) for the apprehension of any such person for the purpose of being brought before a Judge to answer to the offence charged in the order.

(2) The application must be in accordance with the rules.

(3) The order may be made in the absence of one or both parties.

(4) An order for the apprehension of a person may be made whether or not an order has been made under subsection (1)(a).

(5) An order for the apprehension of a person:

(a) must be addressed to all police officers, and

(b) may be addressed to any other person specified in the order, and

(c) may be executed by any police officer or by any person to whom it is addressed at any place at which, had the offence specified in the order been committed at that place, that offence would be triable in the court.

(6) A Judge before whom a person apprehended under an order made under this section is brought may, if bail is not dispensed with or granted, issue a warrant:

(a) committing the person to a correctional centre or other place of security, and

(b) ordering the person to be brought before a court at the date, time and place specified in the order.""

12The relevant rule for the purpose of s 246(2) is Pt 53 r 26 of the District Court Rules 1973 (r 26). That rule is in the following terms:

""26(1) Proceedings under section 246 must be commenced in the Court by an application in the approved form for the issue of a summons or for the issue of a warrant for apprehension.

(2) The summons or warrant for apprehension must be in the approved form and must be lodged with the application.

(3) A statement of facts in respect of the offence signed by the prosecutor applying for an order under section 246 is to be lodged with the application.

(4) Where a prosecutor is seeking an order for the apprehension of a person, the application is to be accompanied by an affidavit setting out both the statement of facts and the reasons why a warrant is sought.""

13It should be noted that s 3 of the CPA defines ""prosecutor"" and ""rules"" as follows:

""prosecutor means the Director of Public Prosecutions or other person who institutes or is responsible for the conduct of a prosecution and includes (where the subject-matter or context allows or requires) an Australian legal practitioner representing the prosecutor.""

""rules means rules made for the purposes of a court to which the relevant provision applies.""

14The provisions of s 16, s17(2), s 20 and s 21(1) of the CPA are also relevant. These provisions provide as follows:

""16(1) An indictment is not bad, insufficient, void, erroneous or defective on any of the following grounds: 

(a) for the improper insertion or omission of the words 'as appears by the record', 'with force and arms', 'against the peace', 'against the form of the statute' or 'feloniously',

(b) for want of an averment of any matter unnecessary to be proved or necessarily implied,

(c) for want of a proper or perfect venue or a proper or formal conclusion,

(d) for want of any additional accused person or for any imperfection relating to any additional accused person,

(e) for want of any statement of the value or price of any matter or thing, or the amount of damage or injury, if such value, price or amount is not of the essence of the offence,

(f) for designating any person by the name of his or her office, or other descriptive appellation, instead of by his or her proper name,

(g) except where time is an essential ingredient, for omitting to state the time at which an offence was committed, for stating the time wrongly or for stating the time imperfectly,

(h) for stating an offence to have been committed on a day subsequent to the finding of the indictment, on an impossible day or on a day that never happened,

(i) if the indictment was signed by an Australian legal practitioner who has been instructed to prosecute the proceedings to which the indictment relates on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions-for failure by the Director to authorise the Australian legal practitioner by order in writing under section 126 (2) to sign indictments for and on behalf of the Director.

(2) No objection may be taken, or allowed, to any indictment by which criminal proceedings (including committal proceedings) in the Local Court or for any other offence that is to be dealt with summarily are commenced, or to any warrant issued for the purposes of any such proceedings, on the grounds of: 

(a) any alleged defect in it in substance or in form, or

(b) any variance between it and the evidence adduced at the proceedings for the offence charged in the indictment or warrant.""

""17(2) The court before which the objection is taken may cause the indictment to be amended and, in that case, the trial is to proceed as if there had been no defect.""

""20(1) An indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor: 

(a) with the leave of the court, or

(b) with the consent of the accused.

(2) This section does not affect the powers of the court under section 21.

(3) For the purposes of this section, an amendment of an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment.""

""21(1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.""

The grounds of appeal and notice of contention

15The Attorney relied on the following grounds of appeal:

""GROUND ONE:

His Honour erred in dismissing the summons in matter number 2012 / 171786 and matter number 2012 / 171817, which were commenced against the respondent by orders granted by his Honour Justice Blanch, Chief Judge of the New South Wales District Court, on 29 May 2012.

GROUND NINE:

His Honour erred in determining that Inspector Melinda Walsh had delegated her authority as prosecutor to Mr David Hall, solicitor for the prosecutor, in the instituting of the prosecution against the respondent in matter number 2012 / 171786 and 2012 / 171817.

GROUND TEN:

GROUND ELEVEN:

His Honour erred in determining that Mr David Hall, solicitor for the prosecutor, did not have authority to sign the statement of facts, as solicitor representing the prosecutor in each of the applications to commence proceeding in matter number 2012 / 171786 and 2012 / 171817 alleged against the respondent.

GROUND TWELVE:

His Honour erred in determining that the applications to commence proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales for a summary offence in matter number 2012 / 171786 and 2012 / 171817 alleged against the respondent were required to be signed by Inspector Melinda Walsh.

GROUND THIRTEEN:

GROUND FIFTEEN:

His Honour erred in determining that the statement of facts in matter number 2012 / 171786 and 2012 / 171817 alleged against the respondent was required to be signed by Inspector Melinda Walsh.

GROUND SIXTEEN:

His Honour erred in determining that the statement of facts in matter number 2012 / 171786 and 2012 / 171817 alleged against the respondent was required to be composed by Inspector Melinda Walsh.

GROUND SEVENTEEN:

His Honour erred in applying R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 to determine the Notice of Motions before him.""

16It should be noted that Ground 2 was abandoned during the course of the hearing. Senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney indicated, however, that the Attorney may seek to rely on this ground in other proceedings relating to the same issue.

17The ""notice of contention"" filed by the respondent relied on the following ground:

""His Honour should also have held that:

(a) each Summons in proceedings 2012/171786 and 2012/171817, which remained unamended, was defective in that they each failed to disclose an offence known to law; and

(b) those defects were incapable of being cured by amendment.""

18It should be noted that ""indictment"" is defined for the purpose of Pt 2 of Ch 2 of the CPA, in which the sections referred to in par [14] above appear, as including any process or document by which criminal proceedings are commenced: CPA s 15.

The reasoning of the primary judge

19The primary judge stated that the question for determination was whether the subject matter or context of the prosecution permits the extended meaning of prosecutor contained in s 3 of the CPA.

20He stated that the question was to be answered in light of the legislative purpose behind s 106 of the OH&S Act, s 246 of the CPA and r 26.

21The primary judge pointed to the fact that s 106(1) of the OH&S Act expressly restricted the authority to institute proceedings to a limited class of persons including an inspector appointed pursuant to the OH&S Act. His Honour pointed to the wide powers of investigation conferred upon inspectors by the OH&S Act, concluding as a consequence that they were uniquely empowered to determine if and when charges should be laid. He concluded that the legislative scheme requires that the inspector investigate the circumstances involving possible breaches of the OH&S Act and accept personal responsibility for any charges laid. He said that there was no provision for the delegation of such authority.

22His Honour concluded that in these circumstances s 246 of the CPA and r 26 ""effect a parliamentary intention that where the right to institute proceedings is expressly conferred by an Act on a specified person, the signature of that person upon the charge should constitute a warrant to the court, the accused, and other interested persons"" that the proceedings were brought in accordance with s 106(1) of the OH&S Act (emphasis in original).

23In these circumstances his Honour found the proceedings had not been brought in accordance with s 106(1) of the OH&S Act and were void.

24So far as the matter the subject of the notice of contention is concerned, the primary judge accepted that the charge was defective in that it did not aver the necessary ingredients of an offence under s 8(2) of the OH&S Act, namely, that the employer failed to ensure that people ""other than employees"" were not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of the employer's undertaking while they were at the employer's place of work. His Honour speculated at par [55] that it may have been intended to bring a charge under s 8(1), rather than s 8(2).

25The primary judge also concluded that the provisions of s 16(2) of the CPA did not operate to prevent objection being taken to the form of the charge for want of averment of a necessary ingredient. He stated that s 16(2) of the CPA proceeded on the basis that all necessary ingredients are averred or implied in the charge. As that was not the position in the present case, he concluded that s 16(2) had no application.

26The primary judge accepted that if the charge contained nothing which could possibly identify an offence known to law, then it could not be amended as it would be a nullity. However, he stated that the defect did not fall into this class of case but rather that it ambiguously identified two possible offences. In these circumstances he concluded that s 21(1) of the CPA permitted amendment of the charge.

27The primary judge expressly stated that he was not expressing any opinion as to whether an amendment should be permitted if it was applied for.

The Attorney General's submissions

(a) The appeal

28The Attorney in his submissions did not seek to deal separately with each ground but rather made general submissions concerning the grounds raised.

29The Attorney submitted, correctly, that a properly appointed inspector of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (WorkCover) has power under s 106(1)(c) of the OH&S Act to institute proceedings for a contravention of that Act. However, he submitted that in doing so he or she was exercising the statutory power under the authority, advice and direction of WorkCover, relying in that context on what was said by the High Court in Crothers v Sheil (1933) 49 CLR 399, by this Court in Ove Arup Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2006] NSWCA 28; (2006) 149 IR 193 and the decision of the Land and Environment Court in Corbyn v Walker Corporation Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 75; (2012) 186 LGERA 442. The Attorney submitted that the real prosecutor was WorkCover and that in those circumstances there was at most a defect in the information which could be cured by amendment.

30The Attorney referred to the affidavit of Inspector Walsh sworn on 21 September 2012, in which Inspector Walsh stated that she determined to institute proceedings against the respondent and that Mr Hall applied on her behalf to the District Court to seek orders under s 246 of the CPA to commence the proceedings. In that context the Attorney submitted that Mr Hall appeared on the instructions of WorkCover.

31The Attorney submitted that s 246(1) of the CPA is a machinery provision for an order for the issuing of a summons and to obtain the attendance of the accused person to answer the charge. He submitted that there was no requirement pursuant to r 26 that the application or the summons be signed by the prosecutor, only that the statement of facts be signed.

32This may be doubted because r 26 states that proceedings under s 246 of the CPA must be commenced by an application in the approved form. The approved form provides for signature by the prosecutor. However, it is correct that the summons does not have to be signed.

33The Attorney submitted that the scheme adopted by s 246 of the CPA and r 26 is analogous to a charge being preferred by a police officer. The Attorney sought to contrast this procedure with a mandatory requirement in s 126 of the CPA that an indictment is required to be signed by an authorised person.

34The Attorney submitted that the evidence before the primary judge was that Inspector Walsh ""was the prosecutor, officer-in-charge of the investigation"". In that regard he pointed to her affidavit of 21 September 2012 in which she stated that she determined the charge and allegations to be alleged, and further, in the application to commence proceedings, the summonses and the statement of facts, the prosecutor was stated to be Inspector Walsh. The Attorney submitted that the material showed that Mr Hall was ""the legal representative of the prosecutor"". At the hearing senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney departed from this submission somewhat, stating that material showed that Mr Hall was the legal representative for Inspector Walsh.

35It should be noted that contrary to this submission, Inspector Walsh did not say that she determined the charge and allegations to be alleged against each of the defendants. Rather, in her affidavit of 21 September 2012 she stated that she determined to institute proceedings against, amongst others, the respondent and Air Conditioning Engineering Services Pty Ltd for offences under s 8(2) of the OH&S Act.

36The Attorney submitted that Mr Hall did not say he was the prosecutor, but rather that he was the legal representative for WorkCover. Once again this was modified at the hearing where it was submitted that Mr Hall stated that he was the legal representative of the prosecutor. The Attorney submitted that the position of Mr Hall was analogous to that of a police prosecutor, or a solicitor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or Environmental Protection Authority, being a person who could appear to represent the prosecutor in the prosecution before the court.

37The Attorney submitted that a summons, unlike an indictment, did not require the signature of the prosecutor to constitute a valid charge. The Attorney said that in applying R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 the primary judge failed to appreciate the difference between indictments and summary prosecutions; in particular, contrary to an indictment, a summons commencing a prosecution only needs to be signed by the judicial officer who has granted the application for the issuing of the summons. He also repeated the incorrect submission that r 26 did not require the application to be signed by the prosecutor.

38In that context the Attorney submitted that it was not the purpose of the legislation that if the application or statement of facts was not signed by the prosecutor then the summons would be void. The Attorney emphasised that the only purpose of the application to commence the proceedings was to obtain the attendance of the relevant defendant before the court to answer the charges the subject of the summons.

39At the hearing senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney emphasised that the issue was whether Inspector Walsh could be regarded as having instituted the proceedings in circumstances where the application to commence proceedings and the statement of facts were signed by Mr Hall as her representative. He submitted that although Mr Hall signed the application and statement of facts on behalf of Inspector Walsh, once it was appreciated that the prosecutor was WorkCover, then the reasoning of the primary judge to the effect that r 26 required Inspector Walsh to sign the application and statement of facts could not be supported. Senior counsel pointed to the fact that s 106 of the OH&S Act does not provide that the inspector who investigated the matter the subject of the charge be the inspector who instituted the proceedings. Senior counsel stated that this reflected the fact that the ultimate responsibility lay with WorkCover. 

40In submitting that Mr Hall had authority to sign the applications and the statements of facts, senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney relied on s 3 of the CPA which as I indicated defines prosecutor to include an Australian legal practitioner representing the prosecutor. He submitted that provided an inspector was prepared to institute proceedings, then there was nothing to prevent the word prosecutor being read as including a legal practitioner representing the prosecutor. He submitted that the documents filed made it quite clear that the prosecutor was Inspector Walsh.

41Senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney submitted that there was nothing in the context of the CPA and the OH&S Act which would indicate a contrary conclusion. He said that the purpose of the application was to have the summons issued and was not related to the merits of the prosecution. He pointed out that the requirement in s 106 of the OH&S Act related to the institution of the proceedings and not the signing of any particular document.

42Senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney also submitted that even if his submission that the application and statement of facts were not required to be signed by the prosecutor was incorrect, s 16(2) of the CPA precluded objection being taken to the document on that point. He submitted that s 16(2) applies to all criminal courts in the jurisdiction, referring to Garrett v Freeman [2006] NSWCCA 278; (2006) 68 NSWLR 729 and Epacris Pty Ltd v Director-General, Department of Natural Resources [2007] NSWCCA 76; (2007) 69 NSWLR 507. He submitted in that context that if there was a defect it was not a nullity but rather a curable defect.

(b) The notice of contention

43The Attorney submitted that although the primary judge had concluded that the defects in the charge were capable of remedy, he had not in fact determined whether he would permit an amendment. In these circumstances the Attorney submitted that the issues raised by the notice of contention should not be determined at this stage.

44The Attorney submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal does not have jurisdiction to hear the matters raised in the notice of contention. He submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal is constituted by statute and has no power other than that conferred upon it by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. He submitted that the Court was not entitled to hear an ""appeal"" pursuant to a notice of contention. Further, he submitted there was no provision in the Criminal Appeal Rules for the filing of such a notice.

45In relation to the substantive issue raised by the notice of contention, the Attorney relied upon the submissions of the Inspector in the Court below. In contending that the defects were capable of amendment, Inspector Walsh placed reliance on the principles set out below which were said to govern the operation of s 16(2), s 17(2) and s 21 of the CPA. It was submitted that these principles could be derived from what was said by Basten JA in Rockdale Beef Pty Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 128; (2007) 165 IR 7 at [109]-[132] and from GPI (General) Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 157; (2011) 207 IR 93.

46The first of these principles was that the purpose of the initiating process was to engage the jurisdiction of the court and also to ensure procedural fairness to the defendant.

47As a corollary of this, where not enough has been done to engage the jurisdiction of the court within the limitation period, the proceedings may be a nullity. However if properly commenced, questions of procedural fairness may be addressed once the defendant has been served.

48Second, deficiencies may be so gross that as a matter of construction s 16(2) of the CPA would not be read as applying to them.

49Third, in assessing whether a defect is of a kind that might not be cured by s 16(2), reference must be made to the purpose of the statutory requirements not complied with and the likely effect of the non-compliance.

50The submissions of the Inspector in the Court below also stated that a statutory provision which permits amendment of a charge by particularisation at any time should not be subject to implied limitations. It was submitted that failure to plead the essential elements does not make a charge unknown to law and, further, that an inadequately charged offence also does not necessarily make the charge one unknown to law.

51In the present case senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney submitted the defective words used were required to be read in context. He submitted that both the description of the offence and the section headed ""Statutory Provision Describing Offence"" within each summons referred to s 8(2) of the OH&S Act. He submitted that reading each summons in its entirety including Annexure A, disclosed that the defendant was an employer, the persons at risk were non-employees, and the risk arose from the defendant's undertaking and at the defendant's place of work. He submitted that in those circumstances each summons and particulars could be seen fairly to charge a known criminal offence under s 8(2) of the OH&S Act.

52Senior counsel on behalf of the Attorney also submitted that the first of the defects in the summons was the insertion of the words ""at work"" rather than referring to the employer's place of work. He said that the particulars made it clear that the employer's place of work was at the site. He said the second deficiency, namely, failure to aver that the risk arose from the conduct of the employer's undertaking, was also rectified by the particulars. He submitted that consistent with what was said in Rockdale Beef supra and Area Concrete Pumping Pty Ltd v Inspector Childs [2012] NSWCA 208; (2012) 223 IR 86, the defects in these circumstances did not result in the charge being a nullity and could be cured by amendment.

The respondent's submissions

(a) The appeal

53Unlike the Attorney, the respondent in its written submissions dealt separately with each ground of appeal.

Ground 1

54The respondent submitted that the proceedings before the primary judge were instituted by the filing of the applications with their accompanying summonses and statements of facts on 25 May 2012. It submitted that in these circumstances the true issue in respect of Ground 1 is whether the primary judge erred in dismissing each summons.

55The respondent submitted that having regard to the terms of s 106(1), the conclusion of the primary judge could only be understood as a finding that the prosecutor failed to prove the proceedings were instituted by a person authorised to do so. It submitted that it was implicit in this conclusion that the primary judge found that the proceedings were instituted by Mr Hall, albeit in the name of Inspector Walsh.

56The respondent submitted it was open to the primary judge to reach this conclusion. It pointed to the fact that the applications and the statements of facts which on their face required the signature of the prosecutor were signed by Mr Hall, albeit as a solicitor representing the prosecutor. It submitted that the primary judge was correct in concluding there was no evidence that Inspector Walsh composed the summonses or statements of facts. It submitted that although Inspector Walsh stated in her affidavit that she determined to institute proceedings for the contraventions of the OH&S Act, there was no evidence that she had settled, approved or even sighted the applications, summonses and statements of facts, or turned her mind to the context of the allegations, or that she instructed Mr Hall to institute proceedings in the form in which they were in fact instituted.

57The respondent submitted that in those circumstances the determination of the appeal turned upon the question of whether Mr Hall was entitled to institute proceedings as agent for the inspector who was so authorised.

58The respondent submitted that s 106(1) of the OH&S Act expressly conferred the right to institute proceedings on specified persons or classes of persons. It submitted that the section is exhaustive in its language and does not provide for either the institution of proceedings by a person acting on behalf of an authorised person or for any delegation of authority to institute proceedings.

59The respondent submitted that the extended definition of ""prosecutor"" in s 3 of the CPA is not a source of authority to institute proceedings under the OH&S Act. It submitted that this was because the extended definition is subject to an express limitation within s 3, being ""where the subject matter or context allows or requires"". It was submitted that in the present case the context did require otherwise, the context being the absence of any authority to delegate in s 106(1)(c) of the OH&S Act.

60The respondent submitted that the institutional or administrative arrangements of WorkCover cannot affect the clear words of s 106 of the OH&S Act. It submitted that whilst it may explain the manner in which the proceedings were instituted, it does not provide a basis for concluding that the solicitor had authority to commence proceedings.

61The respondent submitted the primary judge was correct in concluding that the legislative scheme required acceptance by the inspector of personal responsibility for the content of any charge to be prosecuted and, further, that s 246 of the CPA together with r 26 reflected a parliamentary intention that the signature on the documents by the authorised person constituted a warrant to the court that the prosecution was brought pursuant to that express conferral of authority. It submitted that absent such a warrant, the onus remained with the prosecutor to satisfy the court that the person who instituted the proceedings was authorised to do so. The respondent submitted that the prosecutor failed to discharge that onus.

Grounds 3 and 4

62The respondent submitted that these grounds were effectively based on the proposition that the dismissal of the summonses was based on the conclusion that Blanch J erred in granting the applications to commence proceedings. The respondent pointed out that the conclusion of the primary judge did not depend on the identification of such an error.

Ground 5

63The respondent submitted that apart from the submissions made in respect of Ground 1, the Attorney did not suggest the primary judge committed any further error which would fall within this ground.

Grounds 6, 12 and 15

64The respondent submitted that the summary jurisdiction of the District Court was governed by Pt 5 of Ch 4 of the CPA. It submitted that any application must be made in accordance with the District Court Rules. It submitted that as the application and statement of facts had not been made in accordance with the rules, these grounds were not made out.

Ground 7

65The respondent submitted that the Attorney was incorrect in submitting that the primary judge had concluded that s 246 of the CPA required the signature of the inspector to be placed on the charge. It submitted that the primary judge went no further than concluding that s 246 and r 26 demonstrated a parliamentary intention that where the right to institute proceedings is conferred on a particular person, the signature of that person constitutes a warrant to the court that the prosecution is brought in accordance with s 106(1) of the OH&S Act.

Ground 8

66The respondent submitted that for the reasons given in respect of Ground 1, the primary judge was correct in concluding that the proceedings were instituted by Mr Hall rather than Inspector Walsh.

Ground 9

67The respondent submitted that contrary to what was stated in this ground, the primary judge did not find that Inspector Walsh had delegated her authority as prosecutor to Mr Hall. It referred to par [26] of the judgment of the primary judge to the effect that no power exists for delegation of such authority. It submitted that for the reasons given in respect of Ground 1, the primary judge was correct in drawing this conclusion.

Grounds 10 and 11

68As with Ground 9, the respondent submitted that the primary judge did not make the asserted finding, namely, that Mr Hall lacked the authority to sign the applications to commence proceedings. It submitted that the finding by the primary judge was that there was non-compliance with r 26 because Mr Hall was not a person authorised to commence proceedings for an offence under the OH&S Act. The respondent submitted that for the reasons referred to earlier, this conclusion was correct.

Grounds 13 and 16

69The respondent submitted it was incorrect to state that the primary judge found that each summons was required to be composed by Inspector Walsh. It pointed to the finding of fact that there was no evidence that either the summonses or the accompanying statements of facts were in fact composed by her. It submitted that this finding was a relevant but not conclusive fact supporting the conclusion of the primary judge that the proceedings had been commenced by a person not authorised to do so.

70The respondent accepted a different outcome may have occurred if there had been some evidence that Inspector Walsh had accepted responsibility for the content of the charges by composing, settling, approving or even sighting the summonses and statements of facts prior to filing. It noted that had the documents in fact been signed by Inspector Walsh, that would have amounted to conclusive evidence that she instituted the proceedings.

Ground 14

71The respondent submitted that although the primary judge referred on one occasion in his judgment at par [12(b)(i)] to a submission made by the respondent that the summons was required to be signed by the prosecutor and reached a conclusion consistent with that submission at par [17], it was a slip or typographical error as no submissions to that effect had been made in the Court below.

Ground 17

72The respondent submitted that the primary judge did not simply apply R v Janceski supra, but rather pointed to the fact that the reasoning standing behind the requirements for compliance with s 126 of the CPA was apposite so far as it concerned the importance of certainty on the face of the documents by which the proceedings were instituted that the person who made the decision to prosecute had authorised the commencement of proceedings in the specific form in which they were in fact instituted.

(b) Submissions at the hearing

73At the hearing senior counsel for the respondent emphasised the specific requirement in s 246(2) of the CPA that the application must be made in accordance with the rules. He stated that the District Court Rules called for the use of approved forms which unmistakably refer to the prosecutor.

74So far as the definition of ""prosecutor"" contained in s 3 of the CPA is concerned, senior counsel for the respondent submitted that in this case context required the reference to prosecutor to not extend to an Australian legal practitioner representing the prosecutor. This was because the effect of the application of the extended definition in s 3 would be to make Mr Hall the prosecutor which was directly contrary to the requirements of s 106(1) of the OH&S Act. He submitted this could be contrasted to cases where the CPA imposed requirements on the prosecutor which could be carried out by their legal representative, giving as an example attendance at court for pre-trial directions. He emphasised that s 3 was not an authorising provision or an agency provision but rather a definition section.

75Senior counsel for the respondent also submitted that the requirement that the application and statement of facts be signed by the prosecutor was contrary to the suggestion that a prosecution can be instituted and carried out by an agent.

76Senior counsel for the respondent also submitted that the structure of s 106 of the OH&S Act indicated there was no room for delegation of the authority to institute proceedings.

77Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that s 16 of the CPA did not operate to remedy the defect. He submitted that the effect of s 16 was not to authorise signature by an Australian legal practitioner. He pointed to the fact that the issue in Garrett v Freeman supra was different; the question in that case concerned the effect on the validity of proceedings resulting from the fact that a person authorised to bring the proceedings brought them in the wrong capacity. He submitted that where the proceedings were brought by a person who had no authority to do so, the proceedings were a nullity and there was no room for the operation of s 16(2).

(c) The notice of contention

78The respondent submitted that the Court had jurisdiction to deal with this issue. It submitted that to the extent Hunt J decided in R v Beydoun (1990) 22 NSWLR 256 that when an appeal under s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is sustained the Court must set aside an order quashing the indictment, the decision should not be followed. The respondent submitted that what was said by Hunt J was obiter dicta. Further, it submitted that the remarks were not directed to circumstances where the indictment was liable to be quashed on other grounds.

79The respondent submitted that the absence of any specific procedure in the Criminal Appeal Act or Criminal Appeal Rules did not lead to the conclusion that the Court had no power to deal with the issue.

80So far as the substantive issue raised by the notice of contention was concerned, the respondent contended that each of the summonses alleged an offence that did not exist at law, namely, a duty ""to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of persons other than its employees"". 

81The respondent submitted there were no available means to overcome this defect. It submitted that reliance could not be placed on either s 11 of the CPA as the offence was not described in the words of any section creating the offence, or on s 12(1) of the CPA because the prosecutor had not used any short expression to describe the offences in general terms.

82The respondent submitted that whilst on its face s 16(2) of the CPA might provide a means of overcoming the defect, the section does not allow a court to overlook a failure to disclose an offence known to law. It submitted this was determined by cases such as Doja v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 303; (2009) 198 A Crim R 349 and also followed from what was said by Basten JA in Rockdale Beef supra at [132] that where there is uncertainty or ambiguity as to the identification of the offence or the nature of the offence, the defect will be outside the scope of s 16(2) of the CPA.

83The respondent contended that this case was to be distinguished from cases such as Rockdale Beef supra, GPI (General) Pty Ltd supra and Area Concrete Pumping supra, which each involved defects of omission. It submitted that in the present case the defect cannot be cured by way of additional particulars, elements or words. Amendment, it submitted, would substitute a totally different charge. At the hearing senior counsel for the respondent submitted that there was no platform on which an amendment could be built.

Consideration

84Neither party contended that the Attorney did not have the right to institute this appeal under s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act. They were correct in not doing so: Ove Arup Pty Ltd supra at [65].

85It is convenient to deal with the matters the subject of the appeal under three heads. First, were the proceedings instituted by Inspector Walsh? Second, was it a requirement that Inspector Walsh sign the applications and statements of facts? Third, if the proceedings were not instituted by Inspector Walsh as required by s 106(1)(c) or if she was required to sign the applications and statements of facts, do the provisions of s 16 and the amendment provisions in the CPA mean the charges were not invalid?

Did Inspector Walsh institute the prosecution?

86The question is whether Inspector Walsh instituted the proceedings for the offences charged. I have referred to proceedings for the offences charged because s 106(1) of the OH&S Act refers to ""Proceedings for an offence against this Act"" rather than merely proceedings under the Act. This would seem to me to require that an inspector institute proceedings for a particular offence. Whatever else be the case, s 106(1)(c) would not be complied with by an inspector authorising another person to bring such proceedings as he or she thought fit arising out of a particular set of facts.

87Further, the proceedings must be instituted by an inspector. It is not enough that the inspector consents to another person instituting the proceedings. Whilst a Minister of the Crown and an officer prescribed by the regulations can by s 106(1)(a) and (b) give written consent to another person to institute proceedings, no such power is conferred on an inspector. The OH&S Act thus makes it clear that it is the inspector personally who must institute the proceedings for the offence.

88The critical question is what is meant by or involved in the institution of proceedings for an offence. The word ""institute"" is relevantly defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as to ""set up"", ""initiate"" or ""start"" and in the Macquarie Dictionary as ""to set on foot; inaugurate; initiate"": The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed (1973) at 1085; The Macquarie Dictionary (1982) at 918. However, the meaning must be considered by reference to the context and purpose of the section: Certain Lloyd's Underwriters Subscribing to Contract No IH00AAQS v Cross [2012] HCA 56; (2012) 87 ALJR 131at [23]-[26] and the cases there cited.

89The context in the present case is that the legislature has evinced an intention that only a limited class of persons has the power to institute proceedings for an offence against the OH&S Act. That class included inspectors. Inspectors were given extensive powers of investigation under the OH&S Act, power under s 91 to issue notices requiring contraventions to be remedied and powers under s 93 to issue notices prohibiting conduct giving rise to risks to health or safety. The right to institute proceedings was thus given to persons who had particular responsibility for the administration of the OH&S Act and the preservation of workplace safety.

90In that context it seems to me that the institution of proceedings by an inspector requires an inspector, at a minimum, to turn his or her mind to the particular offence in question and direct that charges for a particular offence be laid. Where, as in the present case, the institution of the proceedings requires the preparation of a statement of facts, an inspector at the very least has to consider that statement of facts and direct that a charge containing those particulars goes forward.

91Such a construction recognises the potentially serious consequences that can flow from a contravention of the legislation. It also recognises that the requirement that proceedings for an offence against the OH&S Act be instituted by a prescribed person is not a mere formality.

92In the present case Inspector Walsh gave evidence of her involvement in the institution of the proceedings. In her affidavit of 21 September 2012 she stated that in May 2012 she decided to institute proceedings against the respondent and Air Conditioning Engineering Services Pty Ltd for offences under s 8(2) of the OH&S Act. However, she did not state that she approved the particular charges in question or the statements of facts which were relied upon in support of the issuing of each summons.

93So far as the position of Mr Hall was concerned, Inspector Walsh gave the following evidence:

""3. David John Hall applied on my behalf to the District Court pursuant to s.246 of the Criminal Procedure Act for orders that Built NSW Pty Limited, Air Conditioning Engineering Services Pty Limited, Bravo Industries Pty Limited and Ruben Benjamin Bravo appear before the court.""

94In that paragraph of her affidavit Inspector Walsh did not say that she authorised Mr Hall to apply for the orders, much less that she authorised the applications be made based on the applications and statements of facts which were filed in the District Court on 25 May 2012.

95The statement by Mr Hall on the applications and statements of facts that he signed them on behalf of Inspector Walsh does not in my opinion alter the position. Taken in conjunction with the evidence of Inspector Walsh, it cannot establish that she approved the particular charges and statements of facts which instituted the proceedings.

96In these circumstances, in my opinion, Inspector Walsh did not institute the proceedings against the respondent for the alleged offences.

97I do not think that this can be overcome by the submission that the real prosecutor was WorkCover. Section 106(1) of the OH&S Act did not state that WorkCover could institute proceedings for a prosecution or consent to one of its employees doing so. The cases that were cited in support of the proposition do not, on analysis, support it.

98Crothers v Sheil supra was a case where the informant, an officer of the Milk Board, had authority to lay an information on behalf of the Board but in doing so mistakenly laid it in his name rather than in the name of the Board. It was held that the defect was capable of remedy under s 65 of the Justices Act 1902, the then equivalent to s 16(2) of the CPA. That case unlike the present involved the laying of an information by a person who had authority to do so.

99Ove Arup Pty Ltd supra relevantly involved the question of whether a prosecution under the OH&S Act brought by an inspector is, for the purpose of s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act, a proceeding to which the Crown was a party.

100Basten JA, with whom Spigelman CJ and Mason P agreed, noted at [62] that the inspector was appointed by a statutory authority representing the Crown and brought the prosecution pursuant to their statutory authority as an inspector. He concluded at [71] that the inspector is an officer carrying out statutory functions in the public interest, effectively representing the authority which is taken to be the real party to the proceedings, in that case the body being the WorkCover Authority representing the Crown.

101So much may be accepted. However, that does not mean contrary to the clear words of s 106(1) of the OH&S Act that WorkCover, or any person employed or authorised by that body, can institute proceedings.

102In Corbyn v Walker Corporation Pty Ltd supra, the proceedings up to the time of trial had been instituted and maintained in the name of the Director-General of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, rather than in the Director-General's own name, Lisa Corbyn. Preston J (Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales) held that by virtue of s 16(2) of the CPA no objection could be taken to this defect. This was consistent with Crothers v Sheil supra.

103The defendant in Corbyn v Walker Corporation Pty Ltd supra was found guilty of the charges brought against it. However, prior to sentence Ms Corbyn resigned from her office. There was then a challenge to the retainer of the solicitors and counsel appearing for the prosecutor.

104Preston J rejected the challenge. He held that the proceedings did not abate following Ms Corbyn's resignation and that the Department of Environment and Heritage, which replaced the abovementioned Department, could continue to maintain the proceedings. This hardly surprising result says nothing on the question of who was authorised to institute proceedings under s 106(1) of the OH&S Act.

105The alternative basis on which the Attorney sought to justify the charges was to state that Mr Hall was the solicitor for the inspector. Even if that is established, for the reasons I have given the inspector was not entitled to delegate the formulation of the charges and the statements of facts and permit the charges to be laid without at least having approved them.

106It was not suggested by the Attorney that this conclusion was inconsistent with the decision of this Court in R v Bacon [1973] 1 NSWLR 87. In R v Bacon, s 36 of the Obscene and Indecent Publications Act 1901 required prosecutions under that Act to be brought with the approval of the Minister. The Court held at 95 that the approval may be in completely general form. However, that may be distinguished from the present case where what is required is the institution of proceedings for an offence. The requirement that the institution of proceedings be by an inspector and that it be for an offence against the OH&S Act demonstrates, in my opinion, that what is required in s 106 is more onerous than the requirement to give approval considered in Bacon. What is of importance in Bacon is the statement by the Court at 96 that it is for the prosecution to prove the requisite authority. In my opinion the prosecution has not done so in the present case.

107In these circumstances, the proceedings were not instituted by Inspector Walsh as required by s 106(1)(c) of the OH&S Act and, subject to the operation of s 16(2) of the CPA, it follows in my opinion that the charge was not properly brought. On that basis the primary judge was correct in dismissing the summons.

Were the applications and statements of facts required to be signed by Inspector Walsh?

108Having regard to the conclusion I have already reached, it is not strictly necessary to consider this question. However, it is appropriate to consider whether the failure of Inspector Walsh to sign the applications and the statements of facts would render the charges invalid even if she had instituted the proceedings in the manner to which I have referred above. 

109The question is whether as a matter of construction the legislative intent exhibited by s 246(2) of the CPA in stating that an application for a person to appear to answer a charge must be in accordance with the rules, coupled with a requirement in r 26 that the application and statement of facts must be in the approved form, which as set out above provides for signature by the prosecutor, demonstrates an intention that a failure to do so is fatal to the validity of the application: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [91]-[98]; R v Janceski supra at [48]-[50]; Knaggs v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCA 83; (2007) 170 A Crim R 366 at [32].

110In R v Halmi [2005] NSWCCA 2; (2005) 62 NSWLR 263 Bell J, with whom Simpson and Buddin JJ agreed, emphasised at [34] that the requirement that an indictment be signed by the person referred to in s 126 of the CPA was to ensure that proceedings were properly commenced by persons having authority to do so. Her Honour concluded that the absence of a signature by an authorised person on an indictment renders it invalid.

111In R v Janceski supra, this Court held that an indictment signed by a person not authorised to do so by the CPA was invalid. Spigelman CJ at [97] indicated that the primary purpose of s 126 of the CPA was to ensure that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, subject only to the Attorney General, would be in control of the process of instituting criminal proceedings on indictment and that that would be manifest to all parties in the proceedings. Wood CJ at CL at [205] emphasised that the indictment was the instrument by which the jurisdiction of the court to try an accused was invoked and was an essential procedural step. Howie J, with whom Hunt AJA and Johnson J agreed, emphasised at [232] that the presentation of an indictment was the most fundamental of the procedures that attend a criminal trial for an indictable offence. He concluded at [264] that if an indictment was signed by a person not authorised to do so, the signature was worthless and incapable of representing to the court that the prosecution was authorised by the Director or that it was regular. His Honour stated that it did not matter that the person who signed the indictment had been briefed to appear for the Director to prosecute the offence. He emphasised at [273] that s 126 of the CPA was not concerned with the statement of the charge.

112Section 16(2) of the CPA had no application to the indictments that were considered in each of those cases.

113The question which arises in the present case is whether the legislature intended strict compliance with s 246(2) of the CPA and r 26 in the case of summary proceedings. In John L Pty Ltd v Attorney General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42; (1987) 163 CLR 508, an information was said to be defective for failing to identify the material particular in which a retailer's statement was alleged to be false or misleading and thus constituting a contravention of s 32(1) of the Consumer Protection Act 1969. At 519, the majority made the following comments concerning the function of the information:

""The traditional function of an information was to found jurisdiction to deal with an alleged offence. Disregarding the effect of statutory provisions curing or precluding reliance upon a defect, the old authorities established that an information should be quashed as insufficient in law and invalid if it failed to inform the justices before whom it was laid of the nature of the offence and the manner in which it had been committed. The rationale of that requirement has, in more recent times, commonly been seen as lying both in the necessity of informing the court of the identity of the offence with which it is required to deal and in providing the accused with the substance of the charge which he is called upon to meet: 'an accused person could not be required to defend the charge if the information did not supply the particulars necessary to enable him to prepare his defence'...""(Citation omitted)

114The majority held that in that case the provision of s 6(1) of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967 (Summary Jurisdiction Act) (the equivalent to s 16(2) of the CPA) had nothing to say as to the invalidity of the information.

115The question of whether it was mandatory that the prosecutor sign the applications and statements of facts in the sense the charges would otherwise be invalid depends upon the operation of s 16(2) of the CPA.

116The requirement in s 246(2) of the CPA that the application to institute proceedings for an offence must be in accordance with the rules is to be read in context with what appears in s 16(2). The question in the present case is twofold. First, if the proceedings were not instituted by the prosecutor does s 16(2) apply to save them notwithstanding non-compliance with s 106(1)(c) of the OH&S Act? Second, if contrary to the views I have expressed the proceedings were instituted by the prosecutor, is the failure by the prosecutor to sign the applications and statements of facts a defect of form or substance to which s 16(2) can apply? 

The effect of s 16(2) of the CPA in the present case

117Section 16(2) must be considered in conjunction with s 17(2), s 20 and s 21 of the CPA, which respectively gives the court power to cause the indictment to be amended, to grant leave to amend the indictment or to amend the indictment to meet the circumstances of the case.

118However, it is clear that not all defects in the charge can be saved by s 16.

119The extent of the operation of s 16 of the CPA has generally been considered in the context of charges which were defective by virtue of the omission of an essential factual or legal element of the offence.

120In Rockdale Beef supra, Spigelman CJ stated at [27] that s 16 did not apply to save a charge that omitted an essential legal element of an offence. However, Basten JA, with whom Mason P agreed, took a somewhat different view. His Honour, after citing Ex parte Thomas; Re Otzen (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 261, made the following comments at [123]:

""[123] These remarks are inconsistent with the proposition that a failure properly to plead the elements of an offence necessarily rendered the information invalid. Indeed, the power of 'amendment' itself may be inconsistent with such a conclusion. Accordingly, so long as a defect can be remedied by amendment, the informations are not 'void' in the sense that the 'defects cannot be removed by amendment or otherwise put aside', adopting the terminology of Mahoney JA in Boral Gas at 518C-D; 36-37, nor are the proceedings based on them a nullity.""

121In Doja v The Queen supra, the appellant was convicted of a number of counts of making a false statement to obtain financial advantage contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900. He appealed on grounds including that the indictment in relation to two counts was defective in failing to allege knowledge or recklessness. Spigelman CJ emphasised at [3] that it is a fundamental principle of criminal law that an indictment must disclose an offence punishable by law. At [26] his Honour referred to the paragraph from the judgment of Basten JA in Rockdale Beef which I have set out above, emphasising the use of the word ""necessarily"" and stating that Basten JA was not considering the jurisdictional role of an indictment.

122In John Holland Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 338; (2010) 202 IR 82 the statement of charge was said to be defective because it failed to identify the act or omission which constituted a contravention of s 8 of the OH&S Act. Spigelman CJ at [45], with whom Beazley JA agreed and Giles JA agreed with additional reasons, noted that the proceedings potentially raised the issue left open in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [30], namely, whether and how s 6(1) of the Summary Jurisdiction Act (the equivalent of s 16(2)) might affect the right to certiorari if an application to quash the charge was made prior to it being heard. After referring to s 246(2) of the CPA and r 217B of the Industrial Relations Commission Rules 1996 (the equivalent of r 26) he made the following comments at [47]:

""[47] These provisions constitute a direct route to the proposition that a failure to identify the nature of the offence constitutes jurisdictional error. An Application under s 246(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act requires an accused to answer 'to the offence charged in the order'. Section 246(2) and r 217B, as noted, both use the word ""must"". The reasoning in Kirk gives these mandatory requirements specific content.""

123However, his Honour found the charge was not invalid and did not have to deal finally with the issue.

124In GPI (General) Pty Ltd supra at [32]-[26] Hodgson JA, with whom Allsop P agreed, stated that whilst the High Court in Kirk supra decided that the requirement that a statement of offence in the case of omission under s 8 of the OH&S Act required identification of the measures that should have been taken to address the relevant risks, it did not decide this requirement displaced s 16(2) of the CPA or rule when particularisation had to occur. At [78]-[79], Basten JA adhered to the views he espoused in Rockdale Beef.

125In Area Concrete Pumping Pty Ltd supra, I endeavoured to summarise the authorities and concluded that a failure to adequately particularise a charge will not, without more, render it a nullity as defects can be cured by amendment of the charge or subsequent particularisation, at least provided that the charge disclosed an offence known to law and that procedural unfairness had not occurred. I also concluded at [47]-[49] that this could extend to an inadequately described offence, but not one that does not disclose an offence known to law. Basten JA at [113] and Hoeben JA at [117] agreed with my reasoning on this issue.

126None of these cases dealt with the issue the subject of this appeal. However, it does not seem to me that s 16(2) of the CPA can operate to validate a prosecution that has been instituted by a person without authority to do so. Such a failure is more than a defect in substance or in form. It is an unauthorised act which, in my opinion, is different to a defect contemplated by s 16. Further, it is incapable of amendment. The requirements of s 106 of the OH&S Act look to the institution of the proceedings. In my view, the amendment power in s 17(2) and s 21 of the CPA could not extend to deeming the proceedings to have been instituted by someone other than the person who in fact purported to institute them.

127It therefore follows that s 16(2) of the CPA cannot operate in this case to save the charges.

128However, I should add that my present view is that if Inspector Walsh had instituted the prosecution for the offences in the sense which I have described in par [90] above, the fact that the applications and statements of facts were signed by someone other than the inspector would not render them invalid. In those circumstances there would be compliance with s 106(1)(c) of the OH&S Act and there would be only a failure to comply with s 246(2) of the CPA and r 26. It seems to me that this would be a defect to which s 16(2) of the CPA could apply. The onus would be on the prosecutor to prove that an inspector instituted the proceedings, but once that was established there seems to me to be no procedural unfairness in concluding that the defect was one of substance or form within the meaning of s 16(2).

129This conclusion is not inconsistent with R v Halmi supra or R v Janceski supra. Section 16(2) had no application to the indictment in those cases.

130For these reasons the appeal should be dismissed. It is unnecessary to deal with the individual grounds of appeal as I have adopted the same approach as the Attorney and dealt compendiously with his submissions, both written and oral.

The notice of contention

131Once again it is not strictly necessary to deal with this issue but having regard to the submissions made it is appropriate to do so.

132I do not think that it is correct that this Court does not have the power to deal with the issue raised. It is true as the Attorney pointed out that this Court is a statutory court and its powers are limited to those conferred on it by the Criminal Appeal Act and by any other statute. It is also true as Hunt J pointed out in R v Beydoun supra at 264 that s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act does not give this Court a general discretion to prevent the prosecution proceeding to trial. 

133However, that does not mean that if the summons was liable to be quashed on grounds other than those raised by the primary judge the Court would be unable to deal with them, particularly if those grounds were raised at first instance. It must be remembered that the appeal is against an order quashing the summons and if the summons should have been quashed on grounds other than those relied upon by the primary judge, then this Court in my opinion has the power to dismiss the appeal.

134The absence of rules relating to the filing of a notice of contention does not affect the issue. The notice of contention provided for in r 50.11 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 is a convenient way of bringing the issue before the court. The absence of such a provision in the Criminal Appeal Rules does not affect the power of this Court to deal with the issue.

Built NSW Pty Limited [ACN 083 928 045] a corporation with its registered office situated at Level 1, 140 Myrtle Street, Chippendale in the State of New South Wales ('the defendant'), being an employer, on 27 May 2010, at 401-411 Sussex Street, Haymarket in the State of New South Wales ('the site') failed by its acts and/or omissions particularised in Annexure A (attached) to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of persons other than its employees, and in particular Jamie Zonno and Joshua Jiminez contrary to section 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.

27 May 2010

401-411 Sussex Street, Haymarket NSW 2000

Attached as 'Annexure A'




Section 8(2) Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.



42015

ANNEXURE ""A"" - PARTICULARS FOR BUILTre ZONNO & JIMINEZ

(1) The Defendant was at all material times an employer.

(2) The Defendant's place of work was the site.

(3) The Defendant's undertaking at the site was that of principal contractor for the construction works taking place at the site.

(4) Due to the Defendant's failings as particularised below, Jamie Zonno and Joshua Jiminez were placed at risk of falling from height.

(5) In particular, Messrs Zonno and Jiminez were exposed to the risk of falling from a work area on top of the lift/fire stair over run on level 8 of the site referred to as the 'lift lid' whilst moving duct work onto the lift lid.

(6) The particulars of the acts or omissions of the Defendant are:

(a) The defendant failed to ensure the lift lid was made safe by secure perimeter screens, fencing, handrails or other forms of physical barriers that were capable of controlling the risk of Mr Zonno and/or Mr Jiminez from the lift lid;

(b) The Defendant failed to ensure Bravo Industries provided a safe work method statement which addressed the task of moving duct work onto the lift lid;

(c) The Defendant failed to ensure that Jamie Zonno and Joshua Jiminez were inducted into a safe work method statement relating to moving duct work onto the lift lid;

(d) The Defendant failed to ensure that Jamie Zonno and Joshua Jiminez were inducted into the safe way to go about the task of moving duct work onto the lift lid.

(e) The Defendant failed to provide any supervision of Bravo Payroll employees on 27 May 2010.

(7) As a result of the failures set out above, Jamie Zonno and Joshua Jiminez were placed at risk of injury.

The second summons and particulars attached as Annexure A were in similar terms in relation to a different individual, Mr Pulver.

136The particulars to the summons identify that the respondent's place of work was at the site identified in the summons. It also indicates the manner in which Messrs Zonno and Jiminez were placed at risk and particulars of the acts and omissions alleged against the respondent.

137The difficulty with each summons is they adopt the language of the opening words of s 8(1) of the OH&S Act, including the words ""at work"", in seeking to formulate a charge under s 8(2). That is why the primary judge at [55] believed that it was possible that the pleader intended to formulate a charge under s 8(1). For a charge alleging an offence under s 8(2) to be properly pleaded it would need to aver that persons other than employees of the respondent were exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the respondent's undertaking while at the respondent's place of work.

138The summonses thus do not, in my opinion, disclose offences known to law. It is not a case where what has occurred is that an essential element has been left out which can be cured without procedural unfairness to the defendant: Rockdale Beef supra at [123]. Rather on its face, although expressed to be brought under s 8(2) of the OH&S Act, it pleaded the elements of an offence under s 8(1) of that Act which had no application to Messrs Zonno and Jiminez because as stated in the summons they were not employees of the respondent.

139The particulars do assert that Messrs Zonno and Jiminez were exposed to risk of injury and to that extent meets the requirements of s 8(2) of the OH&S Act. However, the acts and omissions particularised against the respondent are equally applicable to a charge under s 8(1) as to a charge under s 8(2) of the OH&S Act. The same analysis also applies in relation to the second summons concerning Mr Pulver. 

140In these circumstances it seems to me that the deficiencies are so great that they do not plead a charge known to law as distinct from merely omitting or mispleading an essential element of the charge which could be cured by amendment or further particularisation. It follows that I do not think that the defects are ones to which s 16(2) of the CPA applies, nor ones which could be cured by amendment consistent with the authorities to which I have referred above.

141I appreciate that as was stated in R v Boujaoude [2008] NSWCCA 35; (2008) 72 NSWLR 85 at [45], an indictment will not be a nullity if however misparticularised, it discloses an offence known to law. However, in the present case when each summons alleges one offence and does not plead the necessary elements but pleads matters relevant to a different offence, it does not seem to me that this approach can be adopted.

142Further, I do not think this is case such as that considered by Dixon J in Broome v Chenoweth (1946) 73 CLR 583 at 601, where an offence is clearly indicated but in its statement there may be some slip or clumsiness which upon a strict analysis results in an ingredient of the offence not being the subject of a proper averment. For the reasons I have indicated, in my opinion, the defects in this case fall outside any such slip or clumsiness.

143In these circumstances, in my opinion, each summons discloses no offence known to law and are not saved by s 16(2) of the CPA, nor are they capable of amendment pursuant to s 21 of the CPA.

Conclusion

144In the circumstances the appeal should be dismissed.

145BEAZLEY P: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

146HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

2762886,R v Kaine (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1824,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Michael Peter Kaine (""the offender"") is to be sentenced for the crime of murder.  It is a crime that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.  There is also a standard non-parole period of 20 years. 
The victim
2Mr Dennis Griffin was a 62 year-old disability pensioner who lived in a single bedroom unit in a complex in Platt Street, Waratah.  He had suffered from cranial dystonia for some 20 years.  He was described as being very thin (he was 177cm tall and weighed some 60kg), unsteady on his feet, and he constantly twitched.  He was hunched over when he walked; he had a limp; and a speech impediment. His sister said that he was ""pretty weak""; she did not think he had much strength at all.  A neighbour said that he had difficulty holding on to things and would often drop them. 
3Mr Griffin was security conscious and he was described as a very private person.  He did, however, have regular outings to a hotel next door.  He would go to the Town Hall Hotel around opening time and ask for a Diet Coke and a glass of ice.  He would talk to whoever was there; consume usually only half of his drink; and then leave.  Most Saturdays he would make his way to a shopping centre where he would do his shopping and then meet up with his sister who would drive him home.
4Mr Griffin was acquainted with a man named James Chasty.  Mr Chasty was in turn acquainted with Neroli Whyborn and the offender.  Ms Whyborn had a falling out with Mr Chasty.  She accused him of being paedophile and let others know of this, including the offender.  Seemingly because of Mr Chasty's acquaintanceship with Mr Griffin, she falsely and maliciously accused him of being a paedophile as well.  She told the offender and, even though he had never met Mr Griffin, he believed her.
5The offender subsequently told Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, that he felt that Mr Griffin was ""pretty evil"".  He thought, ""what if he hurt any children and he probably has in the past"".  He also said that Mr Griffin and his friends had been ""doing some bad things for some time"". He told Dr Olav Nielssen, also a forensic psychiatrist, that he felt Mr Griffin was a threat to children in the community. 
6The offender was a person who had extreme views about paedophiles.  This possibly arose from having been molested when he was young.  A number of witnesses in the trial spoke of him being passionate and filled with hatred about such people. A report of a psychiatric evaluation of the offender in February 2012 described him as having ""over-valued pre-occupations about paedophiles"". 
The murder
7Late on the afternoon of Monday 3 October 2011, a neighbour heard someone coming up the stairs and then a knocking on Mr Griffin's door.  He heard the door open and then close.  He then heard some noises coming from Mr Griffin's unit; he thought it sounded like people moving furniture around.  After about 15 minutes, he heard Mr Griffin's door open and then slam closed.  He saw a man running down the stairs.
8Mr Griffin was not seen alive again.  At about 5pm the following afternoon, neighbours became concerned that they had not seen Mr Griffin.  The next-door neighbour had a key and so he and another neighbour entered the unit.  They found Mr Griffin dead on his bed, with two wardrobes tipped over on top of him.  They did not touch anything but left the unit and alerted the authorities.
9The subsequent investigation revealed that Mr Griffin had died from multiple injuries.  There was severe blunt force trauma to his face and head.  This caused black eyes, extensive bruising to the entire face, multiple fragmented fractures to the bones in the face including the eye sockets, cheeks and jaw, and a broad fracture across the top of the skull.  It also caused a significant underlying brain injury.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was caused by a small television set found beside the bed being smashed onto his face when he was prone on the bed.  There were 18 stab wounds and 18 slash wounds primarily to the face, neck, chest and abdomen.  Some were of sufficient force to penetrate bone in the ribs and some penetrated the heart.
10In an unrelated incident, the offender was found two weeks later to be in possession of a chicken boning knife, an implement with dimensions consistent with those of the weapon that had been used to cause the various wounds.  DNA material linked the offender to the crime scene.  By early December 2011, police were endeavouring to locate him.  Ultimately he was arrested in Mt Gambier, South Australia, on 22 December 2011.
The offender's defence at trial
11The offender's primary defence at trial was an attempt to raise the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  In support of this he relied upon the expert testimony of Dr Olav Nielssen who was of the opinion that there was impairment of the offender's capacity to understand events, judge whether his actions were right or wrong, and to control himself.  Dr Nielssen considered that this impairment arose from an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, namely traumatic brain injury sustained in motor vehicle accidents in 1998 and 2010 and probable bipolar disorder that had been diagnosed in 1993. 
12The Crown called another eminent psychiatrist, Dr Bruce Westmore. He was not even persuaded that the offender suffered from an abnormality of mind, let alone that he had a substantially impaired capacity in any of the three respects just mentioned.  Clearly, the jury favoured Dr Westmore's opinion over that of Dr Nielssen.  That is understandable given that, in my view, there was a significant element of assumption and speculation in Dr Nielssen's reasoning whilst Dr Westmore's opinion was soundly based upon medical records and more persuasive analysis.  I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Dr Westmore's opinion should be preferred.
13The offender also relied upon self-defence and provocation.  These asserted ""defences"" depended only upon a version advanced by him in his evidence.  In my view, that version was utterly incredible.  He claimed that Mr Griffin indecently assaulted him and tried to lure him into the bedroom for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity.  One of the most preposterous claims he made was that after he had rebuffed Mr Griffin's sexual advance, Mr Griffin had invited him to come into the bedroom and said, ""I like it rough"".
A serious example of murder
14I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender believed that Mr Griffin was a paedophile and he went to his unit in order to confront him about this.  I am satisfied that the offender tricked Mr Griffin into allowing him to enter the unit.  He assaulted him in the living area and continued to do so in the bedroom, including kicking him to the groin.  The assault culminated in Mr Griffin lying prone and defenceless on the bed.  The offender then cut and stabbed him a great many times and smashed the TV onto his face.  As a final indignity he tipped the wardrobes over on top of Mr Griffin and left him for dead.
15The Crown put its case to the jury on the basis that the offender had an intention either to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm.  My conclusion is that it is overwhelmingly clear that the offender's intention was to kill.
16Dennis Griffin was an innocent man who was brutally attacked with extreme violence in his own home and, given his age and very frail physical condition, he was completely incapable of defending himself. 
17This represents a very serious example of the crime of murder.
The offender
18The offender was born in 1963. He was aged 47 at the time of the offence and is now 50.
19He has a criminal history in three states.  There are many convictions and they include assaults, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault with intent to prevent apprehension; resisting police; possession of drugs; malicious wounding; damaging property; breaching domestic violence orders; break, enter and steal; larceny; and having custody of goods suspected to be stolen.  A lot of these matters occurred in the early to mid 1990's. The last entry is for assault in 2010.  
20He has been imprisoned on half-a-dozen occasions.  The longest period of imprisonment was for a period of 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year for two malicious wounding offences in 1992.  Those offences involved the offender producing a knife and using it on two innocent victims, lacerating the throat of one and stabbing the other in the back.
21There was an assault occasioning bodily harm for which the offender was sentenced to 12 months gaol in Queensland in 1996.  He told Dr Westmore that the victim was a man who led a youth group in which his then 11-year-old stepson was involved.  He suspected this man was molesting children.  He told Dr Westmore that one day when this man came around to the home, he ""beat the shit out of him"".
22The offender was born in Victoria and lived his early life there.  He described his childhood as ""reasonably happy until the incidents as a teenager"".  This was a reference to instances of sexual molestation, or attempts of the same, by a priest at a Catholic secondary school and by a man in a railway station toilet.
23His parents separated when he was aged about 14 and he stayed with his mother.  After leaving school he trained as a motor mechanic before changing to an electronics traineeship and became a qualified radio technician. He later resumed his motor mechanic apprenticeship and completed it.  His employment was mostly as a mechanic and in electronics.  
24He came to New South Wales to look for work in about 1990 and while working in Cessnock he met his future wife, Sue.  She had two sons from a previous relationship.  He brought up her youngest son as his own.  They had a son together who is now aged 21.
25While in custody in 1993 the offender was diagnosed with what is now described as bipolar disorder type one.  This was the subject of disputed evidence in the trial.  I prefer the reasoning of Dr Westmore who said, in effect, that with hindsight this was likely to have been a drug-induced psychosis, given that there was evidence of drug use at the time and there was no evidence of any ongoing symptoms when abstinent from drugs.
26The offender was injured in motor vehicles accidents in 1998 and 2010.  The records do not state that the offender sustained any significant enduring brain injury as a result.  He experienced depression but there were other explanations for that.  He returned to work after the accident in 1998, albeit not in the fields in which he was skilled.  He worked at a poultry factory in Toowoomba and as a furniture removalist.  The family returned to the Hunter Valley in about 2003.  He worked intermittently from that time and also acted as carer for his wife who had suffered motor vehicle collision injuries herself.   She later developed cancer and has since passed away.
27At the time of the offence the offender was sharing a flat with his older stepson.  He was in receipt of a Newstart allowance from Centrelink. 
28The offender has a history of alcohol use at levels that are difficult to determine.  He told the jury that he drank alcohol once a week. It seems that, at times, he has been a heavy drinker according to a description given in a statement by his late wife.
29The offender claimed in his evidence before the jury that he had little involvement with illegal drugs.  He said that he ""never had a speed habit"", but had tried it once or twice but didn't like it; he had never taken heroin; and he had only tried cannabis once or twice and didn't like it either.
30There was an incident in 2012 while the offender was on remand that resulted in him sustaining a severe head injury.  He had a fall for reasons he cannot recall on 30 July 2012.  He suffered a fractured skull and an intracranial lesion.  
31When he interviewed the offender in March 2013, Dr Nielssen detected some signs of injury to the frontal lobes of the brain and indicators of significant impairment of cognitive function from the offender's mental state examination.  He described the offender as being slow in his responses; he had difficulty switching to new topics; and a test administered during the interview required some effort to answer simple questions.
32However, when he was interviewed by Dr Westmore on 26 August 2013 he was found to be alert and attentive; he was neat, tidy, pleasant and co-operative in presentation; he maintained good eye-contact and spoke spontaneously and expansively; his mood and affect, whilst restricted, were appropriate; there was some mood reactivity but he did not present as depressed; and there were no psychotic symptoms displayed.  Elsewhere in his report, Dr Westmore said that there did not appear to be any overt or gross long term cognitive deficits arising from the 2012 head injury.
33Dr Westmore's opinion was that ""you would expect that cognitive problems arising from the internal injury would improve over a period of two years, up to two years following the injury"". A comparison of the mental state examinations by the two experts in March and then August 2013 tends to support that view.  
34The offender told Dr Westmore that he is currently prescribed the antidepressant, Avanza, and he also takes Panadol Osteo as required.  Mr Cavanagh, counsel for the offender, told me that his instructions were that the current medications were Avanza, Serapax and Codeine.  (The pain medications are likely required in relation to a cervical spine injury the offender sustained in one of the motor accidents.)  Mr Cavanagh also informed me that the offender is being held in a prison hospital because of his mental condition.
35Preferring, as I do, Dr Westmore's evaluation over that of Dr Nielssen, I am not satisfied that there was any mental condition that had a causative relationship with the killing of Mr Griffin on 3 October 2011. The submissions in support of finding that there was such a relationship in part referred to the frenzied nature of the attack.  I accept that this is a pointer in that direction, but there can be other reasons for it.  To my mind it is explicable because of the extreme views held by the offender about people he thinks are paedophiles. 
36It was also submitted that because of his mental condition the offender is an inappropriate person to make an example of to others.  In other words, general deterrence should not play a role in sentencing.  I am not persuaded of that.  I will reduce the emphasis I place on this factor because, whilst the situation is not entirely clear, it is obvious enough that something is not quite right with the offender mentally.  However, the extent to which general deterrence is less significant is modest.
37Another submission made in the context of the offender's mental condition is that he would experience more onerous custodial conditions.  In my view, the evidence is insufficient to support such a finding.
Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence
38It has not been submitted by the Crown that this is an appropriate case in which the maximum penalty of life imprisonment should be imposed.  I accept that is so.
39It is, however, a very serious example of the crime of murder and sight must not be lost of its objective gravity.
40The trial was conducted by the defence in a relatively efficient fashion in that there was a focus only upon the real issues.  Insofar as this facilitated the administration of justice the offender should be given some credit.
41There are few other matters that go to mitigation of the sentence aside from giving less weight to general deterrence because of the offender's mental condition.  He has no claim to prior good character; his rehabilitation prospects are problematic; and he does not get the benefit he otherwise would have got for a plea of guilty.  
42The offender might be less likely to re-offend when he is finally released, because of his age, but in the intervening period I am not convinced.  Hopefully he will be held in gaols in which he will not encounter any child sexual assault offenders.  His entrenched and extreme views about such people would put them at significant risk of harm.  I am not persuaded by the submission which was to the effect that he had seen the error of his ways.
43The offender said in his evidence that he felt sorry for what he had done to Mr Griffin and that he felt that what he did to him was wrong.  At an earlier point in his evidence he said after leaving Mr Griffin's unit: 
I felt terrible and I felt remorse for his family and to some extent, for him and I'd realised I'd overstepped you know, I wish that I'd just walked out there and left him alone and gone to the police or something about him, but unfortunately he assaulted me and I was trying to defend myself and I went too far.  
44In the context of falsely blaming Mr Griffin for what happened, these claims of ""remorse"" come across as hollow.  I am not satisfied that he is genuinely remorseful.  Although not part of my reasons for coming to this conclusion, I did find that it was confirmed by the offender's attitude when a victim impact statement was read.  Everyone in the courtroom was listening intently, but the offender displayed complete disinterest and occupied himself otherwise.  
45Even with reduced emphasis on general deterrence, both it and personal deterrence are important.  They are important in sentencing for murder anyway, but general deterrence is also important so as to make clear that people simply cannot purport to take the law into their own hands by exacting violent retribution against people they perceive to be responsible for criminal activity.  This case demonstrates what tragic consequences can follow.  Courts administer criminal justice to a standard that requires criminal offences to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.   The offender, however, sought to exact punishment upon a man on the basis of unsubstantiated hearsay.  And he got it so terribly, terribly wrong and killed an innocent man.
Victim impact statement
46A victim impact statement was read on behalf of Mr Griffin's family.  It makes abundantly clear the tragedy and grief the offender's actions have caused to many people.
47Nothing I can do in sentencing the offender can undo the past or make up for their loss; and there are well known constraints upon the extent to which such a statement can be taken into account.  But I am grateful for having been informed of the real impact the offender's actions have had upon so many people.  Again, I extend my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mr Griffin.
Sentence
48Convicted.
49Sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 22 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 7 years 6 months.
50The total term is one of 30 years.
51The sentence will date from 22 December 2011.  The first day the offender will be eligible for release on parole will be 22 June 2034.  The total term will expire on 21 December 2041.

2762889,Youssef v R [2013] NSWCCA 308,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2BLANCH J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

3R A HULME J: Nada Vanja Youssef (""the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon her by his Honour Judge Neilson in the District Court at Sydney on 26 October 2012.

4The applicant had pleaded guilty to offences of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s 33 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 25 years - standard non-parole period 7 years) and specially aggravated kidnapping (s 86(3) Crimes Act - maximum penalty 25 years). She also asked that her guilt in respect of an offence of causing a person to take an intoxicating substance with intent to commit an indictable offence (s 38 Crimes Act - maximum penalty 25 years) be taken into account in sentencing for the wounding offence.

5The judge imposed sentences of 6 years and 9 months with non-parole periods of 4 years in respect of each offence. He accumulated the sentence for the kidnapping offence by 6 months upon that for the wounding offence. Accordingly, the total effective sentence is one of 7 years 3 months with 4 years 6 months as the minimum custodial component.

6Four grounds of appeal were notified. One was abandoned but a fifth was added at the hearing. They are, first, that the judge was wrong to take into account in sentencing for the kidnapping offence that the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim was an aggravating factor in that they exceeded what would amount to actual bodily harm. Second, and in relation to both sentences, that the judge was wrong to take into account in assessing the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty that they had obviated the need for the victim to give evidence. Third, that the judge failed to give proper weight to the applicant's mental condition. Finally, that there was error in not imposing concurrent sentences.

7I am not persuaded that any of the asserted errors occurred. The appeal must fail.

Facts

8An agreed statement of facts was before his Honour. It disclosed that the victim was a 53-year-old woman who was cognitively impaired and had a speech impediment. Her son, Jason, mowed lawns for a living. One of the premises he attended for that purpose was the home of the applicant. The victim usually accompanied him when he went there.

9On 8 March 2011, Jason received a call from the applicant's son to come and mow the lawns at the applicant's home. He and the victim went there in the early afternoon. While Jason was mowing the lawn, the victim went inside where she was offered some wine. She consumed about five glasses. There were some girls present as well as the applicant and her son.

10At some point later in the afternoon, Jason left the premises after he had finished mowing the lawns but the victim, at the applicant's request, remained.

11Sometime thereafter, the victim was dragged into the kitchen where the applicant attacked her. She was thrown to the ground and kicked and punched all over. She felt immediate pain. She was unable to describe her assailants. 

12The applicant retrieved a knife from a kitchen drawer and stabbed the victim multiple times. Injuries were caused to the applicant's scalp, shoulder, left breast and arm.

13The victim was then picked up and placed on a chair. Her hands were taped together and tape was also placed over her mouth. Threats of an unspecified nature were made to her whilst she was bound in this fashion. At some point she experienced difficulty breathing and someone took the tape off her mouth. The applicant then forced two tablets into the victim's mouth. After being forced to ingest them she felt ""giddy"" and her vision became blurred. (Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of diazepam in her blood.)

14Somehow the victim managed to free herself. The applicant and some others then pushed her out the door. She ran across the road and attracted the attention of a householder. He could see that she was in a distressed state and was injured. She said she was scared and expressed a fear that she was going to be killed. She questioned why ""they"" turned on her; and said that she just wanted to die. An ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital.

15The victim was found to have sustained multiple injuries. There were wounds to the scalp, the left forearm and the left breast as well as lacerations to the left shoulder. Most of the wounds and lacerations were dealt with by way of sutures or dermal glue. Surgery was required to repair a wound to the left eyebrow and forehead which had penetrated to muscle. A wound to the left shoulder was found to have extended deeply through the attachment of the deltoid muscle. Wounds to the left forearm were also found to have extended into muscle tissue. The laceration to the left breast was thought to be the cause of a penetrating wound into the chest cavity. Medical opinion was that ""considerable force"" was used to cause this wound and that it was potentially life threatening.

16Police attended the applicant's home and forced entry in the early hours of 9 March 2011. The applicant and her son were arrested. Various things were seen in the dining room and kitchen that were consistent with being the location of the attack upon the victim. A knife was found, apparently stained with blood, with strands of hair adhering to it and with its blade bent at the hilt.

17The Crown tendered a report by Professor Susan Hayes who had assessed the victim and found her to suffer from a ""serious intellectual disability"", functioning in the lowest 0.1% of the population for cognitive reasoning and the lowest 1% for adaptive behaviour. She was described as requiring supervision and social ""habilitation"" in connection with most areas of daily life activities. Professor Hayes said that the victim's cognitive impairment would be obvious to a reasonable person within a few minutes of commencing a conversation with her. She also has a marked speech impediment.

18The Crown tendered a transcript of the applicant's interview with police following her arrest for the limited purpose of demonstrating her knowledge of the victim's cognitive impairment. When asked to describe the victim, the applicant said, ""I think she's mentally slow in the head"". 

19The motive for this attack was said by the judge to be completely unknown. However, he referred to evidence that the applicant had been drinking and had used cannabis. He said that intoxication would explain the applicant's lack of recollection of what occurred and might also explain why the offences occurred. 

20Ultimately, his Honour found that the offences were ""in that mid-range of seriousness of crimes of this nature"". 

Personal circumstances of the applicant

21The following matters were included in the judge's review of the applicant's personal circumstances.

22She was the mother of six adult children. Her eldest child, a daughter, had a significant illness and, with her mother in custody, missed her support during treatment which included chemotherapy.

23The applicant was born in Croatia in 1958 and came to Australia with her family at age 11. She experienced sexual abuse by her eldest brother when she was aged 11 to 16. To escape that abuse she married her first husband at age 16 but the marriage did not last. There were two subsequent marriages, the last of which was marked by domestic violence and ended some time ago.

24The applicant had engaged in employment in her teen and early adult years but at the time of the offences she had been on a disability support pension for about 10 years. She had suffered from a depressive illness for many years and started to receive treatment for it in about 2002 after a stillbirth and the end of her third significant relationship.

25There was an admission to a hospital psychiatric unit for a number of days in 2007. On that occasion she gave a history of using cannabis, methylamphetamine and benzodiazepines and feeling suicidal. She displayed symptoms of paranoid delusions. On discharge she was referred to a drug and alcohol recovery service but, as the judge observed, there was no evidence that she attended.

26The applicant's second husband introduced her to heroin and she became dependent upon that drug for a considerable time before withdrawing with the assistance of a methadone program. The history she gave to Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, was that she had used cannabis since her twenties and was using about one gram per day at the time of the offence.

27In 2009, the applicant returned to Croatia following the deaths of some family members, including her father. There was a dispute concerning a deceased estate in the course of which an uncle threatened her with a gun. 

28She reported being under a lot of stress when she returned to Australia in February 2010. One of her sons, who had been providing care for her, had gone into custody and her mother died after suffering from dementia.

29Dr Furst diagnosed the applicant as suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. The judge said that he could understand that in the light of all of the problems the applicant had encountered but said that it did not explain her criminal behaviour on 8 March 2011.

30The judge also noted that the applicant had developed an epileptic condition. She had experienced seizures with increasing frequency and which had required treatment at hospital. Attempts had been made to manage the applicant's depression and epilepsy with medications that were not compatible, which had caused her to cease taking the antidepressant. 

31There was an issue about whether the applicant had experienced an epileptic seizure on the morning of 8 March 2011. Dr Furst's report included that this could have had an influence upon the applicant's subsequent behaviour. The judge considered the evidence relevant to this issue and concluded that he was not satisfied that she had experienced a seizure that morning.

32The applicant has a criminal record but the entries are confined to the 1980's and the penalties involved fines and bonds. The judge particularly noted that there were no crimes of violence. He regarded this aspect of the applicant's history as ""of no moment"".

33The judge noted that the applicant had been doing well in custody; she was receiving psychiatric care and was attending both AA and NA. He accepted that she was ""clearly resolved to rehabilitate herself, to wean herself off her drug and alcohol addictions"". 

34Reference was made to a report by a Justice Health psychiatrist which included that the applicant, because of her age, lack of significant criminal history and personality traits of being shy and unassertive, had found adjustment to prison life particularly difficult. She had difficulty protecting herself from other inmates. The judge also referred to a passage in the report by Dr Furst where he offered the opinion that a custodial sentence would likely weigh more heavily because of her epilepsy and depression.

35In relation to the last aspect, his Honour considered that the applicant's psychiatric condition and her epilepsy seemed to be better controlled since her admission to gaol. Nevertheless he considered that her ""age and lack of any significant criminal background would cause her difficulty in being a prison inmate"". 

36The judge found that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and a low chance of recidivism. Although it was expressed belatedly, a finding of ""true remorse"" was made as well.

Other aspects of the sentencing decision

37Towards the end of his sentencing judgment his Honour expressed the view that the applicant's personal circumstances were favourable to her ""in many ways"". But he also observed that it was still necessary to concentrate on the seriousness of the offences which he reiterated were each in the ""mid-range"". He observed:

The crimes are serious ones. Not only must the offender be punished for her completely unacceptable and inexcusable and unexplained conduct, but there must be general deterrence for and denunciation of the crimes committed; of restraining, against her will, an intellectually disabled woman of mature years and exposing her to gratuitous, unnecessary violence which had the potential of causing much more serious injuries than were actually inflicted. (ROS 24)

38After reference to the principle of totality for his decision to partially accumulate the sentences, and to some sentencing statistics, the judge indicated that the starting point for each of the sentences would be 9 years which would be reduced by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. He continued:

Such is conceded by the Crown in this particular case, and such conduct is of great utility because it stops the victim having to re-live the offence by giving evidence and to allow an intellectually disabled lady to do that causes her great relief. 

39Special circumstances were found which led his Honour to reduce the non-parole period of each 6 year 9 month sentence from 5 years to 4 years. 

Ground 1: With respect to Count 2 the sentencing Judge erred in finding that insofar as ""... the injuries sustained by the victim went beyond actual bodily harm, the infliction of the wounds ... should be seen as being aggravated pursuant to s 21A(2) [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999]""

40In the course of reviewing matters that he considered relevant to the seriousness of the kidnapping offence, his Honour said:

The final element in the offence under s 86(3) is the infliction of actual bodily harm. Here, the bodily harm inflicted was much greater than actual bodily harm. It was wounding which itself could amount to grievous bodily harm.

In so far as the injuries sustained by the victim went beyond actual bodily harm, the infliction of the wounds as far as the s 86(3) offence is concerned should be seen as being aggravated pursuant to s 21A(2). (ROS 13)

41It was submitted that ""it is an error to treat the injuries sustained as an aggravating factor where, as in this case, injury is an element of the offence"". Primary support for this submission was suggested to lie in the final sentence of s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW):

The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.

42The short answer to this complaint is that the judge did not have regard to actual bodily harm as an element of the offence and ""additional regard"" to it as an aggravating factor. What he took into account as aggravating the seriousness of the offence was such harm that was over and above that which constituted an element of the offence: see, for example, R v Chisari [2006] NSWCCA 19 at [22]; R v Boney [2008] NSWCCA 313 at [42]; and R v Halls [2008] NSWCCA 251 at [35].

43At the hearing of the application it was virtually conceded that there was no merit in this ground. But an additional aspect was raised which prompted the applicant's counsel to formulate a new ground of appeal (see Ground 5 below).

Ground 2: With respect to both counts, the sentencing judge erred in taking into account, as part of the utilitarian value of the applicant's guilty pleas, the fact that the complainant would not need to re-live the offence by giving evidence.

44The written submissions for the applicant referred to the passage from the remarks on sentence that I have extracted above (at [38]). It was submitted that saving witnesses from giving evidence is irrelevant to the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1.

45The judge allowed a discount at the top of the usual range for the utility of the applicant's pleas of guilty. So the applicant's complaint has nothing to do with the benefit she received on that account.

46It was, rather, contended that saving witnesses from giving evidence is relevant to remorse. By regarding it as relevant to the discount for the pleas, his Honour had denied the applicant a more favourable finding as to the extent of her remorse.

47The submissions failed to recognise that the applicant obtained the benefit of a finding of ""true remorse"", albeit something his Honour felt only arose at a relatively late stage. I cannot imagine that if his Honour had considered that the applicant was ""truly remorseful"" as early as the time she entered her pleas of guilty there would have been any difference in the result. What she said in her police interview following her arrest was highly critical and derogatory of the victim and she completely denied any involvement in the offences. The pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court some 13 months later. 

48It should also be noted that the idea that the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty was enhanced by saving her unfortunate victim from having to give evidence was a matter suggested to his Honour by the applicant's counsel in his submissions on sentence. 

49There is no merit in this ground.

Ground 3: With respect to both counts, the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the applicant's mental condition (including giving too much weight to the issue of general deterrence).

50Having reiterated that ""the crimes are serious ones"", his Honour referred to some of the purposes of sentencing provided in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. He referred to punishment, denunciation and also said ""there must be general deterrence"". 

51There was a considerable body of evidence before the judge concerning the applicant's mental condition. The representatives of both parties addressed his Honour as to its significance. The complaint is that the judge ""failed to properly address (or at all) the issue of whether or not the applicant was in fact a suitable vehicle for general deterrence"".

52It was submitted that if the issue had been ""properly considered"", the only finding available was that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, or at least that less weight should have been given to this factor, and that the result would have been the imposition of lesser sentences.

53This was not a clear cut case in which an offender's mental condition mandated less (or no) emphasis being given to general deterrence: cf Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-55]. As counsel for the Crown in this Court pointed out, the onus of establishing this matter in mitigation lay with the applicant: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 281; [27]. The Court was also reminded of the statement of Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 69:

[I]t is erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances such as a mental disorder. 

54A causal link between a mental condition and the offending is not a precondition for finding general deterrence is of less significance: R v Benitez [2006] NSWCCA 21; (2006) 160 A Crim R 166 at [36]-[38] per Simpson J. But the sentencing judge did not decline to find that less emphasis should be given to general deterrence for that reason. 

55I accept that the judge expressed no reason for declining to find there should be less emphasis on general deterrence. His reasons were delivered at the conclusion of submissions with only a luncheon adjournment intervening. His Honour cannot have been expected to refer to each and every point that had been raised on the applicant's behalf. The submissions that were made by counsel for the applicant are recorded over more than 20 transcript pages. His submission on the current issue was, in that context, exceedingly brief:

[T]he fact of her mental illness makes the subjective factors, also her age, makes the subjective factors and the rehabilitation something that would be given more weight than usual, than matters of denunciation and deterrence. 

56His Honour appears to have accepted that submission; at least to the extent that he said that the applicant had many personal factors in her favour and amongst the favourable findings of mitigating features there was a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation and low prospects of recidivism.

57It is not the case that the judge overlooked the applicant's mental condition; indeed, he made extensive reference to it as my earlier summary of the applicant's personal circumstances, drawn from the sentencing remarks, hopefully makes clear.

58One of the matters his Honour found in relation to this topic was that the applicant's depressive disorder appeared to have been brought under control through the treatment and medication regime she had received since going into custody. 

59Having regard to all of these matters I am not persuaded that, whatever weight his Honour gave to general deterrence, it was excessive.

60I would not uphold this ground but, given the difficulties with his Honour's lack of express attention to the topic in his sentencing remarks, I would favour a grant of leave.

Ground 4: The sentence imposed for count 2 was otherwise manifestly excessive.

61This ground was abandoned.

Ground 5: His Honour erred in applying the principle of totality in that he erred in imposing sentences that were not entirely concurrent

62This was the new ground added without objection and by leave at the hearing. In essence, it was contended that the factors relevant to sentencing for both offences were so common that complete concurrency was called for. I respectfully disagree.

63The s 86 offence included the element of detaining the victim. This was not a factor relevant to the s 33 offence. It increased the applicant's total criminality. That is particularly so given most of the considerable period of the detaining occurred after the wounding and it included restraining the victim with tape.

64The extent of the harm caused to the victim was taken into account by the judge in sentencing for both offences. But the s 33 offence included the additional element that the applicant intended to cause grievous bodily harm. That also increased the applicant's total criminality.

65Accumulation of the sentences was called for. The degree to which the judge did so was modest.

Orders

66I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

		10 December 2013",2013-12-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762890,R v King (No. 2) [2013] NSWSC 1811,"Judgment
1On 21 June 2013 I sentenced Sean Lee King (""the offender"") in respect of a number of offences (see R v King [2013] NSWSC 80).  The offences, and the sentences I imposed in respect of them, were as follows:  
(i)in respect of the charge of assaulting Kimberly Lasaqa thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her, a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment, commencing on 1 October 2011 and ending on 30 June 2012.
(ii)in respect of the charge of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon David Lindsay, a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 1 April 2012 and ending on 30 September 2014.
(iii)in respect of the charge of murdering Jazmin-Jean Ajbschitz, a non-parole period of 24 years imprisonment, commencing on 1 April 2013 and ending on 31 March 2037, with a balance of term of 8 years imprisonment, commencing on 1 April 2037 and ending on 31 March 2045.
2The total term of imprisonment imposed was one of 33 years and 6 months.  The total non-parole period was one of 25 years and 6 months.  
3Following the imposition of those sentences, the Crown made an application to re-open the proceedings pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 (""the Act"") specifically in respect of the sentence imposed in respect of the offence in [1](ii) above.  The offender has appeared before the court by video link today.
4The reason for the Crown's application arose from the fact that the offence in respect of which that sentence was imposed was an offence contrary to s. 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  A standard non-parole period of four (4) years applies to that offence.  Although s. 45(1) of the Act permits a Court to decline to set a non-parole period, that provision does not apply in the case of an offence for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed (see SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76]-[78]; Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95 at [47]).  It was agreed between the parties, and I accept, that the sentence imposed for the offence in [1](ii) requires correction.  It was also agreed between the parties that s. 43 of the Act confers a power to re-open the proceedings for that purpose.    
5There have been a number of cases in which the Court of Criminal Appeal has addressed an issue such as the present.  In doing so, differing views have been expressed as to whether, in such circumstances, the fixed term imposed should be regarded as reflecting an intention on the part of the sentencing judge that such term represent the non-parole period (as to which see the discussion in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [55]-[62] per R A Hulme J).  In this respect, the present case is somewhat different in light of the fact that I sentenced the offender.  In doing so in respect of the offence in [1](ii), I set out the circumstances of the offending (at [131]), its objective seriousness (which I found, at [164], to be of a high order), the aggravating factors (at [158]-[159]), the mitigating factors [at 165] and the question of remorse and prospects of rehabilitation [at 166].  As will be evident from my observations at [162], the overall sentence was one at which I arrived having considered principles of totality.
6In sentencing the offender, I came to the view that the overall sentence imposed was a proper reflection of the entirety of the objective and subjective circumstances before me.  Whilst the sentence in [1](ii) must be corrected, the fixed term which was imposed in respect of the offence in [1](ii) will be the non-parole period and an additional term will be imposed.  However, that additional term will be completely subsumed by the sentence imposed for the offence of murder, such that the overall non-parole period, and the overall total sentence, will remain unchanged.   Such a result accords with my original intention.
7Accordingly, I make the following orders:
(i)Pursuant to s. 43(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) I re-open the sentence proceedings of the offender.
(ii)In respect of the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon David Lindsay, and in lieu of the sentence imposed upon the offender on 21 June 2013, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 1 April 2012 and ending on 30 September 2014, with a balance of term of 10 months commencing on 1 October 2014 and ending on 31 July 2015.

		06 December 2013",2013-12-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762891,R v Kaye [2013] NSWSC 1812,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1His Honour: Mark Jamie Kaye pleads guilty to the murder of Maxwell Charles Weir on 20 January 2011. 

2The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period has been prescribed of 20 years imprisonment. These two legislative guideposts are to be borne in mind when the Court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The standard non-parole period does not have determinative significance in sentencing the offender, nor is it a ""starting point"" for the sentence, nor does it directly apply as the offender has pleaded guilty: Muldrock at [31]. I bear in mind s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

3During the proceedings on sentence, Mr P Barnett SC appeared for the Crown and Mr M Ramage QC for the offender. 

4The offender's plea to murder was entered on the basis that his actions had significantly contributed to the death of the deceased. Mr Crown informed the Court that none of the injuries described in the autopsy report would themselves have been fatal to a healthy younger man (ex A TB 3). It was the Crown case that the injuries inflicted by the offender ""overlaid the frailty of the deceased"" which caused the death: T18/11/13 T5 L6-14. Mr Weir was 84 years old when he was murdered. At the time of his death, he had ischaemic heart disease, emphysema and prostate cancer which was not immediately life-threatening (ex A TB 3 p 2). 

5A summary of facts was tendered without objection: ex A TB 2. Mr Ramage told me that these facts are agreed by the offender. Accordingly, I will furthermore refer to them as ""the agreed facts"". 

The agreed facts 

""At about 11.45 am on Friday 21 January 2011, Maxwell Weir, was found deceased, lying on his left side on the floor of his house beside the dining table with one hand on an overturned chair. Blood from his head had pooled on the kitchen floor.

Maxwell Weir, the deceased, was 84 years of age and lived alone in the house on his property Pinewalla at Crookwell. The property itself had passed to his son Kim Weir, who worked it as a sheep and potato property. He attended the property daily and would see his father, whilst there.

The deceased had problems with his heart, lungs and mobility, needing a cane to walk.

On 20 January Kim and his uncle, Brian McLaughlin left the property at about 7pm. They had spent the last half hour talking with the deceased. When they left the deceased was watching television and dressed in his day clothes. When they left the rear wooden door was open, the screen door closed. The front door to the premises was never used.

On 20 January the offender was staying at the home of Chris Hines, the father of his partner Emma Mills, at Crookwell. The property, Pinewalla, is between that address and Goulburn Road. The offender and Ms Mills had a 16 month old daughter. During the morning of that day [Ms] Mills and the offender had been in Goulburn returning to Mr. Hines' house at about 1.30pm.

Ms Mills was to travel to Goulburn that afternoon with her mother, her sister, Lauren and cousin, Brooke, to take in two movies and have dinner. The offender was intended to stay at the home. 

After he arrived the offender purchased some beer, a case of XXXX Gold, which he commenced to consume.

Later Matthew Webb, the husband of another of Ms Mills' sisters arrived. He bought (sic) more beer with him. The women left for Goulburn sometime prior to 4pm. Before she left Brooke Crawford heard the offender ask her sister, Rhiannon, for a couple of bucks.

Before she left Emma Mills locked her Ford motor vehicle. She took the keys with her to Goulburn. At the time the wallet of the offender was in the glove box of the motor vehicle.

At about 4.10pm Chris Hines arrived home from work. The offender, [Mr] Webb and [Mr] Hines continued to drink and were joined by Craig Knight and his girlfriend Rhiannon Crawford. More alcohol and meat were purchased and they had a barbeque.

About 6.30pm Craig Knight decided to return to the bottle shop. The offender decided to accompany him. They both asked Ms Crawford for money and she gave Mr. Knight $30.00 for beer. On the way to the bottle shop the offender complained no one was speaking to him and indicated he did not wish to stay. The offender and [Mr] Knight were captured on the CCTV at the bottle shop. At the time the offender was in a short sleeve shirt, a pair of dark coloured shorts and a pair of thongs with black straps and white upper soles.

At about 6.45pm Knight purchased two 'three packs' of XXXX Gold 750 ml bottles. After the purchase [Mr] Knight rang a friend, Tom Piec and put the offender on the phone. [Mr] Knight heard the offender ask [Mr] Piec for a lift into Goulburn. [Mr] Knight then spoke to [Mr] Piec, who told him not to bring the offender to his house, as he was not going to give him a lift to Goulburn.

[Mr] Knight dropped his phone and the offender picked it up. He then started ringing friends of [Mr] Knight in an attempt to get a lift into Goulburn. [Mr] Knight heard the offender say to Tim Skidmore words to the effect of, 'If I get a bit of money for diesel, would it be possible for you to drive me into Goulburn?' [Mr] Skidmore declined the request.

The offender and [Mr] Knight then parted company. [Mr] Knight gave the offender one of the XXXX Gold 3 packs and the offender told him he was going to hitchhike into Goulburn. The offender then started walking through the Crookwell Showgrounds towards Goulburn Road.

At around 7.30pm the offender arrived at the home of Mr and Mrs. Banfield at Crookwell, which is located opposite the Crookwell showground. The offender asked for cigarettes, when he could not get any he walked off along the road in the direction of Goulburn. Mrs Banfield thought the offender was affected by intoxicating liquor because of the way he walked, 'not staggering, just slow'.


Nardia Lanham was driving on Goulburn Road at Crookwell at about 8pm on 20 January 2011, when she saw the offender, Mark Kaye, walking along the road towards the 'Logan family property'. Ms Lanham knew the offender through school.

Lindsay Gay, who had a mechanical business in Crookwell and also a property called 'Golden Acres', directly opposite the Logan family property 'Kyamma' about 2.5km from the centre of Crookwell, saw the offender sometime after 7:50 pm standing near the 100kph speed limit sign, on the eastern outskirts of Crookwell. The offender was carrying a brown paper bag normally used for long neck beer. Mr. Gay later saw the offender walking out of Kyamma at about 8:25 pm.

Between 8 - 8.30pm Ryan Logan and his father David Logan were on their property 'Kyamma' at Crookwell. They were approached by the offender, who was on foot. He asked them for a lift into Goulburn. David Logan advised him that they were not going into Goulburn and to try his luck on the road. Ryan Logan had observed the offender as he approached him along the driveway of the property. He noted the offender appeared to be having trouble walking in a straight line. He observed a longneck bottle of beer in the hand of the offender. Mr. Ryan Logan watched the offender walk off and then moved to another position, where he was able to observe the offender making his way along the Goulburn [Road] between a property called Normanton and a point some 50 metres from the Driveway to Pinewalla.

David Logan observed the offender, as he walked from the property, to (sic) raise the bottle to his mouth, as if draining it of its contents. It was just on dark at this time.

At the committal hearing Ryan Logan acknowledged, in cross examination, that he had thought the offender, very drunk, - the offender being unsteady on his feet and slurring his words.

David Logan thought the offender [was] drunk to some degree - 'staggering slightly, carrying a bottle of beer and [had] slightly slurred speech.'

The offender left 'Kyamma' and was last seen by Ryan Logan walking along Goulburn Road in the direction of 'Pinewalla'.

Sean Proudman lived at the property 'Normanton,' located across the road from 'Pinewalla'. 'Just on dark' (about 8.30pm) on 20 January 2011 he heard raised voices and dogs barking coming from 'Pinewalla'.

The offender returned to the Hines home at Crookwell at about 9.30pm. When he returned, the offender was no longer wearing his thongs. He said he had been at the showground drinking and sleeping. Mr. Matthew Webb, who had come out of the house, found the offender sitting near the back shed. He described the offender as 'seeming drunk and very fired up.'

Later after the women had returned from Goulburn, the offender asked [Ms] Mills to open the car so he could get his wallet out. When she refused the offender produced $70 cash. When Ms Mills asked where the money had come from the offender did not provide an explanation. In cross examination at the committal Ms Mills agreed the accused was 'drunk' when she returned from Goulburn.

During this time the offender again asked to be driven to Goulburn.

Later arguments developed between the offender and the persons at Mr Hines' house about the offender wishing to be driven by Ms Mills to Goulburn. As a result the offender was excluded from the house. During this time the offender indicated he wanted warmer clothes. Ms Mills used the remote control to open her vehicle from within the house. The offender obtained long pants and a warmer top, into which he changed, from the car. He also took his wallet from the glove box.

The arguments continued and eventually the police were called. They found the offender walking in Pleasant Street Crookwell not far from the home of Mr. Hines. He was taken to the police station in Goulburn, where he took part in an electronically [recorded] interview with the police. During the interview the offender told the police about the events of the evening. In short during the interview the offender told the police that after he went to the bottle shop with Mr. Knight he had sat down on his own and drank the two bottles of beer...in Pleasant Street up behind the home of either Mr. Hines or Mr. Knight.

The offender had cuts to his hands and feet.

On the morning of 21 January at about 8am Kim Weir and Brian McLaughlin arrived at Pinewalla to commence work for the day. When they arrived each noticed the rear external light of the house was still on and the back wooden door was still propped open, both of which events were unusual.

As mentioned earlier Mr McLaughlin found the deceased on the floor of the house, when he went there at about 11.45am for a chat. Having made the discovery he called Kim Weir to the house. A knife blade was on the floor just inside and adjacent to the back doorway. The handle was missing. The blade had not been there the previous evening, when the two men had left. The deceased was checked and no signs of life could be found. The police and ambulance were summonsed. A check of the house showed that the wallet of the deceased was missing as was his favourite walking cane, which had an engraved metal emblem upon it.

The police established a crime scene at the house and crime scene officers attended to make an inspection of the premises, recording their observations photographically and by a video system. Items, including the blade found near the back door, were taken [into] possession and subjected to further examination including fingerprint examination.

On 24 January 2011 a post mortem examination was conducted by Dr. Van Vuuren. This examination revealed that the deceased had sustained bruising and swelling to an area on the right side of his head and swelling to his right ear consistent with blunt force trauma. A tooth had been knocked from his lower denture plate and he had a cut on the inside of his lower lip. He had bruising to his shoulder and chest area. He had two stab wounds to the right side of his neck one of which passed downwards in the sternomastoid muscle for some 70mms. He had two other wounds to the left side of his face consistent with being caused by a sharp object. None these wounds are fatal [on] their own. He had fractures to both sides of the thyroid bone in his neck and bleeding around his eyes and eyelids consistent with the application of blunt force to his neck. He had some minor bleeding within his brain. It was concluded that the cause of death was 'the combined effects of blunt force injuries and asphyxia on a background of ischemic (sic) heart disease and emphysema.'

On that same day specialist police commenced a line search of the paddocks and area surrounding Pinewalla. The search also consisted of a search along the side of the road for a distance of about 2.8kms towards Crookwell. Police Divers also searched some of dams on Pinewalla and adjoining properties. If one walked towards Crookwell from the home on Pinewalla there was a dam about halfway between the home and Goulburn Road. On 25 January searchers located the deceased's missing distinctive walking cane floating at the edge of that dam. Within metres of the dam was a second knife blade, without a handle. Around the blade was a yellow dish cloth with what appeared to be blood staining in a smear pattern. This dish cloth was similar to dish cloths, located in the kitchen of the deceased. In the dam were a towel and a jumper, which belonged to the deceased, which had last been seen in the house not long before 21 January. In order to go from the house, across paddock to the dam and then onto the roadway one has to step over fences with strains of barb wire, including at the top.

Later testing revealed the fingerprint of the offender on the blade, found just inside the back door of the house. Blood matching the DNA profile of the deceased was found on that blade, and the yellow cloth wrapped around the blade near the dam. Two steak knives, which the offender used regularly and kept either in a kitchen drawer or on the sink of the kitchen, were found to be missing. The blades found matched the blades of the missing knives. The black handles have not been found.

The deceased had a housekeeper, who attended to the property weekly. On 20 January she had attended and changed the bed linen and made up the bed. When the deceased was found on 21 January the bed had not been used. When he was found the deceased was still clothed in the clothes, he had been wearing the previous evening, when Kim Weir and [Mr] McLaughlin left.

On 24 January a pair of men's thongs with black straps and white upper soles was located by a dam on the Logan Property only metres from Goulburn Road. One was floating in the water and the other was in the grass before the dam. They were undamaged. This location was again between the homestead at Pinewalla and Crookwell.

On 25 January the police found a XXXX beer bottle in the grass along the northern edge of Goulburn Road near the front of Pinewalla. Later tests revealed a DNA profile on the lip of the bottle consistent with the DNA profile of the offender.

On the afternoon of 25 January the police executed a search warrant at the home of the offender at Goulburn. Amongst other things the police were hoping to find the clothes worn by the offender on 20 January. They did not find the shirt but took possession of a number of pairs of shorts. One of these pairs of shorts was a pair of Bad Boy brand black shorts, which matched the shorts shown on the offender in CCTV footage from the bottle shop at Crookwell. On the inside of both legs were a number of pronounced tears, considered consistent with the shorts coming into contact with barb wire.

That afternoon the offender attended the police station voluntarily. He took part in an electronic recorded conversation with the police. During this interview the offender gave the police a version of his movements on the evening of 20 January. In the interview he told the police that after he separated from Craig Knight, after going to the bottle shop, he remained within the show grounds at Crookwell for some two hours. He said he went to the home of persons across the road from the showground and asked for a lift. He specifically denied going any closer to Goulburn stating he had not gone near the hockey fields on the outskirts of Crookwell on the (sic) Goulburn road. He told the police that he had his thongs on when he returned to the Hines' house after being at the showground. He said he had lost them in the backyard of the Hines' house, during the events that occurred at that house after he had returned from the showground and before the police found him on Pleasant Street.

The plea accepts that after the offender had left the property of the Logan's, he had made his way to Pinewalla, where he had entered the homestead. There he had a confrontation with the deceased, during which the deceased sustained the injuries found on post mortem as a result of the deliberate actions of the offender, which included stabbing the deceased with at least one of the knife blades, and the application of blunt force to the neck of the deceased, sufficient to cause damage to the horns of the thyroid. At the time the offender took the walking stick, jumper, two knife blades, and towels from the home of the deceased. The Crown contends the evidence establishes that he also took the deceased's wallet and contents, the source of the unexplained seventy dollars.""

Further matters of evidence

6I have recounted Dr Van Vuuren's findings following the post mortem that are summarised in the agreed facts. During cross-examination in the offender's committal hearing, Dr Van Vuuren agreed that it could not be suggested that the blunt force injuries in isolation were lethal. The most significant blunt force injuries were on the right side of the head. She agreed that it is possible that those injuries could have been caused by a single blow, but she suggested more than two blows. Dr Van Vuuren agreed that the combination of the blunt force injuries, the asphyxia and the heart condition, along with the emphysema, may have been the combined source of death. She agreed that it was possible that the fracture of the superior horn of the thyroid cartilage could have been caused by a single blow by a blunt object or item like a fist to the throat area. Dr Van Vuuren said the fracture indicated that there was force applied to the neck but it was not an injury that by itself would have killed the deceased. As to the stab wound on the right side of the deceased's neck, Dr Van Vuuren agreed it was not a deep wound and would be described as superficial. The second wound was also superficial and relatively less serious. She agreed it could be that neither of these wounds contributed to the deceased's death. Dr Van Vuuren said that the asphyxia or the emphysema could have been the sole cause of death. 

7In a report dated 26 April 2013, Dr Byron Collins, a consultant forensic pathologist, expressed the opinion that ""it could be reasonably expected that the amount of force required to result in fracturing a superior horn of the thyroid cartilage would be relatively minor, due to the presence of age-related calcification, compared with that necessary to cause a similar injury in a healthy child/youth/adult"" (ex 2 p 3 par 4). He observed that the deceased suffered from significant medical conditions, ""such as chronic obstructive airways disease (emphysema) and ischaemic heart disease, which would have rendered him in a 'parlous' clinical state and were of such severity, particularly the atherosclerotic heart disease, that either could have resulted in his demise of its own accord"" (ex 2 p 3 par 5). Dr Collins opined (at ex 2 p 3 par 6): 

""Whilst it is reasonably possible, that [the deceased] could have survived the injuries sustained during the alleged assault by [the offender], even those involving the head (bruising, traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage), it is my opinion that such a set of circumstances would have increased the likelihood of the deceased suffering a fatal cardiac arrhythmia consequent upon the emotional and physical stress associated with the alleged event. 

In other words, the presence of the deceased's significant medical diseases, particularly atherosclerotic heart disease, likely predisposed him to the generation of a sinister cardiac rhythm disturbance, as compared with an individual in whom such diseases were absent.""

8However, Dr Collins concluded that he was unable to identify (ex 2 p 4):

""...a cause of death which is separate and completely unrelated to the production of the traumatic injuries identified on the deceased, although it should be understood that these injuries themselves were not necessarily fatal, either separately or in combination.""

9During the proceedings on sentence, Emma Mills, the offender's de facto partner, and the offender gave evidence. It emerged from their evidence that the amount of alcohol that the offender was said to have consumed before the murder was more than that stated in the agreed facts. Furthermore, the offender gave evidence of his recollection of events when he was in the deceased's home. The following is a summary of their evidence on these topics. 

10Ms Mills testified that on the morning of 20 January 2011, she went to the 'bottleo' with the offender because he wanted to get XXXX Gold. Later that day, before they returned to Crookwell, they returned to the 'bottleo' and purchased another beer for the offender. When they arrived in Crookwell they stopped at another 'bottleo' to get a case of beer for a barbeque the offender was attending. The case contained either 24 or 30 cans. She said that the offender consumed the whole case except for five of the cans. In cross-examination, she said that at the time she left Crookwell, the offender was ""[a] bit drunk"" and was continuing to drink (T18/11/13 T24 L48-49, T25 L1-2). Later that evening, she received a phone call from her mother that the offender was missing. She returned to Crookwell between 9:30-10 pm, and the offender was there. When she spoke with him, ""he was drunk but [she] was used to it so [she] didn't really pay attention to it"" (T18/11/13 T18 L16-17). There was a confrontation that ended with someone ringing the police and he was taken to Goulburn Police Station.

11The offender gave evidence that he remembered ""[b]its and pieces"" of the day that the deceased died (T18/11/13 T32 L30-32). He recalled going to the 'bottleo' once with Ms Mills to get a long neck beer before going to Crookwell. Once they arrived in Crookwell, they stopped at another 'bottleo' to purchase a case of XXXX Gold. He said he drank nearly the whole case which had either 24 or 30 cans. Later that evening he went back to the 'bottleo' with Craig to purchase more alcohol, namely, ""[a] crate, a bottle of six long necks, XXXX Gold and a bottle of port"" (T18/11/13 T35 L7-8). He drank the alcohol on the way to and at the showground. 

12He recalled wanting to go to Goulburn and he ""[s]tarted hitchhiking"" when he was unable to get a lift (T18/11/13 T35 L42-43). He remembered walking further down Goulburn road and being refused a lift by the residents of the ""Kiama"" property so he continued to walk to the next property, which was ""Pinewalla"", the property of the deceased who he did not know. He walked up the ""Pinewalla"" driveway to ask the deceased for a lift to Goulburn. He could not recall whether the light was on at the back door. He said that ""[he] just knocked on the back door and [he] heard a voice, ask [him] who [he] was and [he] explained who [he] was and [the man] asked [him] to come in"" (T18/11/13 T37 L20-23). He went inside and approached the deceased who was standing up from the chair. He recalled that they spoke for a while. The offender recalled the deceased told him that he ""stunk like a pub"" and had asked him to stop swearing (T18/11/13 T38 L24-27). The offender asked the deceased for a lift but the deceased told him he did not have keys to his car and to ask his son. The offender said that he was swearing and the deceased told him to leave. The offender said that when he went to leave, the deceased struck him with a stick and he backhanded the deceased over the chair. He recalled the backhander hitting the deceased in the chin area, but did not recall seeing the deceased land on the ground and ""[he] left scared"" (T18/11/13 T39 L3). The offender said that when he spoke to the deceased, he didn't take notice that the deceased was an elderly, frail man. He said that ""if he knew ...this wouldn't have happened"" (T18/11/13 T48 L47-48). He related that he was pretty drunk from port. It was the port that made him drunk, which he got from the 'bottleo' in Crookwell before he started hitchhiking.

13In cross-examination, the offender said when he knocked on the door and the deceased asked for his name, he replied, ""me name's Mark"" (T18/11/13 T57 L25-26). He could not explain why the deceased had struck him with the walking cane but it had struck him on the right side of his forehead. The offender said that it did not feel like a full blow and he did not suffer any injury. The offender said he had read the autopsy report and accepted that he had stabbed the deceased and did more than backhand him. 

14The Crown in reply called Kim Weir, the deceased's son, who gave evidence that his father had had two knee replacements and a hip replacement over the years and one of his biggest problems was stability. His father needed a walking cane to maintain his balance and would have no chance of regaining his balance after he had fallen to the floor. Mr Weir said that the deceased had no family friends by the name of Mark and would not have anticipated anyone by that name calling at the house. He said that it was his father's usual practice to go to the back door if there was someone there, but he never locked that door. 

15Mr Crown invited me to reject the offender's evidence as to the consumption of port or the degree of drinking where it differs substantially from that which he told the police in either of the interviews. Mr Ramage said a specific finding as to the consumption of port was not required, but the Court would be satisfied from the evidence of those who observed him shortly before the murder that he was well affected by intoxicating liquor. 

16I do not accept the offender's evidence that he drank port before he arrived at ""Pinewalla"". His attention was directed by the police in the interviews conducted on 21 January 2011 (ex A TB 5) and 25 January 2011 (ex A TB 7) to the alcohol he had consumed but no mention was made by the offender of drinking port. Furthermore, his testimony on this topic was inconsistent. His initial evidence was that he got the port from the 'bottleo' in Crookwell but later said the port was taken from Chris Hines' house. However, I do not think it is necessary to make a finding as to the specific amount of alcohol consumed by the offender. There is ample material in the agreed facts from which the Court can conclude that the offender was affected by intoxicating liquor at the time of the murder. The offender had been drinking for some hours before the commission of the offence. Ryan Logan considered that the offender was very drunk and his father David Logan thought he was drunk to some degree. Both observed that he was unsteady on his feet and his speech was slurred. Matthew Webb described the offender as ""seeming drunk"" and Ms Mills said that he was drunk when she returned to Crookwell (ex A TB 2 par 25). However, the level of the offender's intoxication did not prevent him from attempting to conceal his crime by wrapping one of the knife blades in a dish-cloth and by trying to dispose of it and other items stolen from the deceased, but it is apparent that his intoxication hindered him from successfully achieving his aim. 

17In assessing the veracity of the account given by the offender of the events that he recalled in the deceased's home, I have made allowance for his intoxication. Nevertheless, it is an egregious feature of his evidence that his recollection is substantially confined to matters that are favourable to him, such as being invited into the deceased's home and the first act of violence being the deceased striking him with a walking cane. 

18I find the offender's evidence that he did not take notice of the deceased being an elderly frail man to be implausible. The offender conversed with the deceased an 84 year-old who had difficulties with maintaining his stability. Furthermore, the offender's evidence that he was invited into the home when he said his name was ""Mark"" stands unhappily with Mr Weir's evidence that the deceased would not have anticipated anyone by that name calling at his house and the deceased's practice to go to the back door if he knew that someone was present. Mr Ramage conceded that the offender's recollection that after the backhander he left could not be accepted. Overall, I found the offender to be an unimpressive witness. 

19Mr Crown submitted that on the evidence of the offender, supplemented by Mr Weir's evidence as to his father's stability, the Court would be satisfied that all injuries, other than injury to the area around the mouth, and all other actions by the offender were done to the deceased, after he was knocked over the chair and was on the ground. 

20Senior Constable Harrison observed an area of blood staining behind the deceased's head and that the dining room chair rested in a pool of blood. There were blood spots on the northern wall of the dining room and on the floor behind the deceased. Her evidence as to blood was confined to these observations. No expert evidence was adduced by the Crown as to the blood staining or blood spatter which may have assisted the Court in determining whether the injuries to the deceased were occasioned when he was standing or lying on the ground. Moreover, I have found the offender's testimony to be unreliable. I am unable on the material before me to find beyond reasonable doubt that these injuries to the deceased, were inflicted when he was on the ground. 

21In addition to the agreed facts, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following; 

(i) the offender entered the deceased's home at about 8:30pm and night had fallen by this time;

(ii) whilst in the house, the offender armed himself with two steak knives, using at least one of them to stab the deceased in the neck and inflict the other sharp instrument wounds seen by Dr Van Vuuren in the post mortem;

(iii) he assaulted the deceased causing the blunt force injuries found in the post mortem. The assault included the offender backhanding the deceased with considerable force causing him to fall backwards over a chair. The offender was aware that the deceased had landed on the ground;

(iv) the actions of the offender included the application by some means of blunt force trauma to the neck and the fractures to both sides of the thyroid bone in the neck and bleeding around the deceased's eyes and eyelids. I am unable to conclude on the evidence how those injuries were actually inflicted by the offender;

(v) although the cause of death was the combined effects of blunt force injury and asphyxia on a background of ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, the injuries inflicted by the offender on the deceased were a substantial cause of his death; 

(vi) at the time of the assault, the offender knew that the deceased was an elderly person;

(vii) the offender stole a walking cane, a jumper, a towel and the deceased's wallet from the deceased's home. The $70 cash that the offender produced to Ms Mills was stolen from the deceased;

(viii) the offender wrapped one of the knife blades in a yellow dish cloth taken from the deceased's kitchen. Prior to leaving the deceased's home, the offender dropped one of the knife blades near the backdoor; and

(ix) on leaving the deceased's home, the offender made his way across paddocks and negotiated fences topped with barbed wire. He attempted to dispose of the walking cane, the second knife blade, towel and jumper in and near a dam which was about halfway between the deceased's home and Goulburn Road. He left his thongs in and near the dam on the Logan Property. He arrived at Mr Hines' home at about 9:30pm. 

22I accept that it is more likely than not that at some time during the course of events, the deceased struck the offender with his walking cane. It is evident from the absence of injury to the offender's forehead that there was little force behind the blow. I do not accept, however, that this was the first act of violence and was delivered by the deceased for no reason. Unsurprisingly, Mr Ramage did not submit that the deceased's conduct amounted to provocation either as a defence or as a mitigating factor. It does provide some explanation for the theft of the walking cane. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's attack upon the deceased was unprovoked. 

23Mr Crown did not contend, nor do I find, that the offender entered the home with an intention to steal or to assault the deceased with an intention to inflict serious bodily harm, let alone to kill him. It is clear, however, that having entered the home, the offender viciously attacked the deceased and left him on the floor of his home with callous disregard for his wellbeing. 

24I acknowledge Dr Collin's opinion that the amount of force required to fracture the superior horn of the deceased's thyroid cartilage would be relatively minor and Dr Van Vuuren's description of the stab wounds as being superficial. However, the offender used such force in the assault that the deceased fell backwards over a chair and he stabbed his elderly victim. Having regard to all of the circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. 

25This was a cowardly attack by a younger and undoubtedly stronger man on a senior citizen in his home. In my view, the seriousness of the offence is not reduced by the deceased's advanced years or pre-existing medical conditions. Although the absence of pre-planning provides some mitigation, this is objectively a serious instance of the crime of murder. 

26Mr Crown invited me to find that the offender's intoxication neither mitigated nor aggravated the offence but provided some explanation for the crime by way of disinhibition. Mr Ramage accepted that intoxication did not provide an excuse for the offence but might provide an explanation for it. 

27The offender's intoxication does not mitigate the seriousness of the murder or reduce the offender's culpability but assists in providing an explanation for the crime and the manner in which the deceased was killed: Hasan v R [2010] VSCA 352; (2010) 31 VR 28; R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240. The offender's prior history of heavy drinking and violent offending whilst affected by alcohol demonstrates that his intoxication was not out of character for him. I conclude that his intoxication neither mitigates or aggravates the offence. 

The offender's personal circumstances 

28The offender was born on 23 April 1980 and is 33 years of age. He was 31 years old at the time of the murder. His prior criminal history as an adult, other than driving offences, includes convictions for stealing a motor vehicle, assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, larceny (1998); stealing a motor vehicle, use of an offensive weapon to prevent lawful detention; attempt escape from lawful custody (1999); assault occasioning actual bodily harm, affray (2003); resist officer in the execution of duty, use offensive weapon to prevent lawful detention (2004); assault police officer in execution of duty, use of an offensive weapon to prevent lawful detention (2006); and resist officer in the execution of duty (2009). The offender's unattractive criminal history deprives him of the considerations of leniency to which he may have been entitled if the current offence was an isolated act of criminality. In view of his prior offences involving violence, I give more weight to personal deterrence and protection of society than otherwise would have been the case: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. 

29The offender gave evidence of his background. He had eight brothers and three sisters and the family was living at Mt Druitt. When he was eight, he became a Ward of the State. The offender was placed in different boys' homes until he was 14 years old. He then returned to his mother and father who were living in Canberra. The offender accepted that he had a substantial criminal record but said most of the offences had been committed when he had been drinking. He had thought about stopping drinking ""heaps of times"" and had gone into a six week rehabilitation program in about 2009 (T18/11/13 T44 L42-45). He had finished the program and stayed off alcohol ""[f]or a little bit"": (T18/11/13 T45 L50). The offender said that he drank to get rid of depression. He had been referred to Dr Warwick Williams, a psychiatrist, who told him that he was bipolar and prescribed Lithium. Although he had been told not to drink alcohol because of the side effects when taking Lithium, he had continued to drink and experienced ""buzzing feelings"" in his head which felt like ""it had cement in it"": T18/11/13 T48 L1-3. The offender ceased taking Lithium after a few weeks, but did not return to the psychiatrist.

30Ms Mills testified that her relationship with the offender commenced in 2003 and they have two children aged two and four. She described the offender as drinking ""a fair bit. Pretty much from the moment he got out of bed"": T18/11/13 T9 L36. She recalled a time when it was a condition of a bond that the offender did not drink and she thought he had made it the whole way. Ms Mills said that the offender had spent six weeks in rehabilitation in 2009 but resumed drinking after three or four months. The last time the offender had employment was for a couple of months in 2009. She recounted being present during the offender's consultation with Dr Williams and said that the offender stopped taking the prescribed medication after a few weeks as ""his head felt like it was in a vice"": T18/11/13 T13 L26. The offender did not consult Dr Williams again. Ms Mills referred to the offender as a good father and said ""[y]ou couldn't find a better person"" (T18/11/13 T22 L39-44). She related an incident in which the offender protected an old man from being assaulted. 

31Mr Ramage informed the Court that he did not put the offender's ""sad background...in the Fernando sense...but it [was] all part of the matrix of the man"" that was being sentenced: T19/11/13 T104 L1-5. Mr Ramage was referring to R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 which recognises social disadvantage at sentence and is not confined to Aboriginals: see also Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 302 ALR 192. In any event, there is insufficient evidence to establish on the balance of probabilities that the offender's abuse of alcohol is a reflection of the environment in which he was raised. Nevertheless, I take into account the offender's difficult family background and personal circumstances. 

32A letter dated 16 February 2010 from Dr Williams to Dr Duncan and a letter from Dr Williams to Detective Senior Constable Neil dated 22 February 2011 were tendered (ex 1). The letters confirm Dr Williams' diagnosis of bipolar disorder and that Lithium was prescribed. The offender last saw Dr Williams on 17 February 2010 and did not further consult him or any other psychiatrist. Mr Crown contended that the psychiatric evidence was of no assistance to the Court and ""verges on the irrelevant"": T19/11/13 T94 L23. Mr Ramage agreed that the psychiatric evidence was unsatisfactory but said it did indicate that the offender had attempted to deal with his difficulties with alcohol and had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Mr Ramage conceded that there was no evidence that directly linked his disorder with the offence. On the material before me, I am unable to conclude on the balance of probabilities that the offender's diagnosis of bipolar disorder in 2010 contributed to the commission of the murder, or as having any impact on his time in custody or makes him an inappropriate medium for general deterrence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1. I do, however, take into account the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and the steps that the offender took to overcome his difficulties with alcohol in 2010, which regrettably, were short lived. 

33The community interest in the protection of the elderly who remain living in their homes requires that it be made absolutely clear by this Court that our senior citizens are entitled to live their lives without any fear of violence. I give weight to general deterrence in the sentence. 

34Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by them. By his plea of guilty, the offender has accepted responsibility for the murder. Ms Mills gave evidence that the offender had expressed his remorse and sorrow for the deceased and his family. During his evidence, the offender said that he felt very sorry and regretted drinking so much. Whilst the self-serving nature of the offender's evidence of his recollection of events at the time of the murder has caused me some hesitation in making a finding, I conclude on the balance of probabilities that he is remorseful and take into account his remorse as a mitigating factor. 

35Notwithstanding the offender's remorse, I am unable to make a finding on the balance of probabilities that the offender is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation. Much will depend upon the offender's ability to overcome his difficulties with alcohol. The failures in the past to successfully deal with this problem do not encourage an optimistic view being taken. His prospects of rehabilitation remain uncertain. 

36The offender pleaded guilty to the murder on 2 August 2013. Having been committed for trial on 26 April 2012, he had entered a plea of not guilty on arraignment in this Court on 7 September 2012. His trial was set to commence on 8 April 2013 at Wollongong which was vacated on 25 March 2013. The trial was re-listed to commence on 15 April 2013 but this date was vacated due to the unavailability of the forensic pathologist. The matter was placed in the arraignment list on 3 May 2013, when the defence indicated it was anticipated the matter would be short. It was listed again on 7 June and 5 July before the plea was entered on 2 August 2013. 

37Mr Crown submitted that ""the plea should be regarded as being entered late in the piece, in fact after the day, upon which the matter was first listed for trial"" (CWS p1). Mr Crown argued that the utilitarian value of the plea should not exceed ten per cent. Mr Ramage referred to the complications that arose from the evidence of Dr Van Vuurren at the committal proceedings that were ultimately resolved by the agreed facts. He asked the Court to allow more than ten per cent for the offender's plea. 

38The discount for the utilitarian value of the plea is determined largely by the timing of the plea and generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 per Howie J at [32]. Although this was a late plea, the estimated length of the trial was three to four weeks and involved issues as to the cause of the deceased's death. I assess the utilitarian value of the plea to be 12.5 per cent. 

39Victim impact statements of Kim Weir, the deceased's son, Maree Grieve, the deceased's daughter, and Grahame Dick, the deceased's son in law, were read to the Court. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

40I find special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term of the sentence being the offender's long term need for appropriate psychiatric treatment and alcohol counselling upon release. I have determined that a non-parole period of 14 years 6 months is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].

41The offender was arrested on 16 February 2011 and has been in custody ever since. On 2 March 2011, he was sentenced in the Goulburn Local Court to imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 16 February 2011 and expiring on 15 February 2012 with a non-parole period of 8 months expiring on 15 October 2011 for an offence of driving whilst disqualified. He was also sentenced for an offence of break, enter and steal to imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 16 February 2011 with a non-parole period of 6 months expiring on 15 August 2011. 

42As the offender has served these sentences since he went into custody, it is necessary to consider the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. The offences for which the offender was sentenced in the Local Court are discrete and independent acts of offending. This does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. In the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to commence the sentence on 15 October 2011 being the date that the offender would have been released on parole. 

43Taking into account all matters that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence is 24 years. The overall sentence is reduced by 12.5 per cent to 21 years. 

44Mark Kaye for the murder of Mawell Charles Weir, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 21 years consisting of a non-parole of 14 years 6 months which is to commence on 15 October 2011 and is to expire on 14 April 2026. I set a balance of term of 6 years 6 months which is to commence on 15 April 2026 and will expire on 14 October 2032. 

45The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 14 April 2026. 

46I would strongly recommend that the offender be given the opportunity whilst in prison, to participate in programs which will assist him in resolving his alcohol related problems. I would also recommend that he be seen by a psychiatrist. I ask that these recommendations be brought to the attention of the prison authorities. 

47I ask Mr Voros to advise the offender of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 and of its application to the offence for which he has been sentenced.

1JOHNSON J: The Accused, Paul Andrew Hunter, is charged with the murder of Jason Dixon at Dharruk on 23 June 2011. 
 
Nature of the Application and the Issues For Determination

2This is an application by the Accused to have excluded from evidence at his trial, previous representations contained in a witness statement of his deceased brother, Wade Hunter.

3By Notice of Motion filed 28 October 2013, the Accused seeks orders in advance of the trial under s.192A Evidence Act 1995 (""the Act"") that the previous representations are not admissible or, in the alternative, that their admission into evidence be refused under s.137 of the Act. The Notice of Motion had also sought the exclusion of other evidence in the proceedings. However, that portion of the application was abandoned at the hearing.

4The relevant previous representations were made in a witness statement, given by Wade Hunter to police on 2 September 2011. The version of events given in the witness statement implicates both the Accused and Wade Hunter in the murder of Jason Dixon. Wade Hunter is now deceased and, consequently, unavailable to give evidence. Evidence of those representations is sought to be adduced by the Crown pursuant to s.65(2)(d) of the Act in the form of the document signed by Wade Hunter.

5Section s.65(2)(d) of the Act provides an exception to the hearsay rule, and is in the following terms:

""(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:
 
...

(d) was:

(i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and

(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.

Note. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.""

6A representation will be taken for the purposes of s.65(2)(d) to be against the interests of the maker of the representation if it tends ""to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted"": s.65(7)(b).

7The precondition in s.65(1) is clearly established in this case as the maker of the representations is deceased.

8Further, during the course of the hearing, it was conceded by counsel for the Accused that the previous representations of Wade Hunter were made against his interests. As will become clear, this concession was plainly appropriate having regard to the version of events given by Wade Hunter to police on 2 September 2011. Thus, the requirement in s.65(2)(d)(i) is also established. It follows, therefore, that the primary issue in contention on this application is whether Wade Hunter's representations to police in his witness statement were made in circumstances that make it likely that the representations are reliable for the purpose for s.65(2)(d)(ii).

Factual Matters

9It is useful to set out the factual context in which this application is brought. Only those facts that are relevant to the present issue are contained below.

10During the afternoon of 20 June 2011, the Accused was present, along with a number of other persons, at the residence of Bernard Douglas at 9 Livingston Avenue, Dharruk. Jason Dixon was also present at this location for a period. At some point during the afternoon, several witnesses observed Mr Dixon strike the Accused across the back of the head with an object. No further physical altercation appears to have taken place at this time. Mr Dixon returned to his home, located across the road.

11The Accused left the premises of Mr Douglas shortly thereafter. He obtained a lift with an associate to Mt Druitt, where he is observed on CCTV at a grocery store and a nearby pharmacy at 5.52 pm. The Accused then attended the residence of his brother, Wade Hunter, at 4 Torricelli Avenue, Whalan. The Accused's cousin, Gary Hunter, was also present.

12At 6.42 pm on 20 June 2011, the Accused was observed on CCTV arriving at Mt Druitt Hospital in a white Commodore motor vehicle belonging to Wade Hunter. The Accused was treated by nursing staff and released.

13At about 7.00 pm on 20 June 2011, Jason Dixon's son, Troy Gardner, arrived at Mr Dixon's residence and observed his father lying on the floor of the lounge room, bloodied and barely conscious. Mr Gardner dialled triple ""000"" and an ambulance attended the premises at 7.23 pm. Jason Dixon died on 23 June 2011, the cause of death being multiple blunt force injuries to the head, abdominal cavity and limbs.

14The Accused was arrested in relation to the death of Jason Dixon at the residence of Wade Hunter on 21 June 2011.

15The Crown case against the Accused is that he participated solely or as part of a joint criminal enterprise in an attack upon Jason Dixon, with an intention, at least, to inflict grievous bodily harm as an act of revenge for the earlier incident at 9 Livingston Avenue, Dharruk.

Wade Hunter's First Statement

16Wade Hunter was interviewed by police on 21 June 2011. He also gave a statement attesting to the accuracy of his answers in the interview. 

17According to Wade Hunter's account in his third statement of 2 September 2011, the version of events given by him on this occasion was false. He told police the Accused had arrived at his house between 7.00 pm and 7.30 pm, complaining of a sore head and asking to be taken to the hospital. The Accused apparently did not say by whom he had been struck. Wade Hunter told police that he took the Accused to Mt Druitt Hospital, dropping the Accused off and then returning home. He said the only other person in the car was his son, Tyrel. At the time of giving the interview, Wade Hunter knew the Accused had been arrested but told police that he did not know why.

Wade Hunter's Second Statement

18Wade Hunter gave a second statement to police on 22 July 2011. In this statement, he largely adopted the version of events given in his statement of 21 June 2011, with additional details.

Wade Hunter's Third Statement

19On 2 September 2011, Wade Hunter was in custody at the Mt Druitt Police Station, having been arrested in relation to matters not relevant for present purposes.

20Also present at the Mt Druitt Police Station that day was Detective Sergeant Gary Lowe. Detective Sergeant Lowe was then investigating the death of Jason Dixon and was aware of prior statements given by Wade Hunter. Detective Sergeant Lowe was made aware that Wade Hunter wanted to speak with him. He proceeded to see Wade Hunter in an interview room at the Mt Druitt Police Station where Wade Hunter said words to the effect of, ""I can't live with it anymore, I've got to tell you what happened but if you can get me bail I can show you where the weapons are"". Detective Sergeant Lowe said, ""I'll try and get you bail but I can't guarantee anything"". A Detective Tillett was present also during this conversation. The conversation was not recorded in any way.

21Detective Sergeant Lowe spoke with the Bail Sergeant at Mt Druitt Police Station and inquired as to the possibility of Wade Hunter obtaining conditional bail for the purpose of assisting in the murder investigation. However, it became apparent that the warrant pursuant to which Wade Hunter was arrested required him to go before a court to obtain bail. Upon conveying this information to Wade Hunter, Detective Sergeant Lowe observed Wade Hunter to be quite upset and crying. He said, ""You've got to get me bail"". It was suggested by Detective Sergeant Lowe that if he directed police to the location of the weapons and police verified that information, that might be something that could assist Wade Hunter in his bail application. Detective Sergeant Lowe acknowledged that he made it clear to Wade Hunter that there would be a benefit to him in assisting the police. Again, this conversation was not recorded.

22Detective Sergeant Lowe spoke with the police prosecutor who would be appearing in court at the bail application and requested that Wade Hunter be given conditional bail to allow him to assist in the police investigation. Despite this, Detective Sergeant Lowe could not recall if a formal document was prepared for the presiding Magistrate. 

23Wade Hunter was granted bail in the Mt Druitt Local Court later that afternoon. Detective Sergeant Lowe did not attend the bail application.

24Wade Hunter then participated in a drive-around with police to locate weapons referred to by him in his earlier discussions with Detective Sergeant Lowe. Upon returning to the police station, Wade Hunter gave a third statement to police. It is representations contained in this statement (dated 2 September 2011) that the Crown seeks to tender at the trial of the Accused.

25In his third statement, Wade Hunter resiled from his earlier account. He gave a version of events that implicated not only the Accused, but also himself in the attack upon Jason Dixon. The representations made by Wade Hunter to police in the statement of 2 September 2011 now relied upon by the Crown may be summarised as follows:

(a)The Accused came to his home on 20 June 2011 about half an hour before he dropped the Accused at Mt Druitt Hospital (based on the footage captured on the hospital's CCTV cameras, this had to have occurred at about 6.00 pm).

(b)The Accused said, ""Can you drive me up to Bernie's I want to get three bottles of methodone [sic] and a script of Xanax"".

(c)As they were leaving, Gary Hunter arrived. The Accused instructed Gary Hunter to ""get in the fucking car and grab a [weapon]"". Gary Hunter picked up a fence pole from Wade Hunter's front yard and entered the vehicle.

(d)The Accused said, ""Where [sic] gunna kill this cunt if he don't give me my methadone"".

(e)The Accused directed Wade Hunter to drive to a specified location. On the way there, the Accused said to Gary Hunter, ""You look after the young cunt and I will look after the old cunt"".

(f)Upon arrival at the location, the Accused and Gary Hunter exited the vehicle and the Accused removed an implement similar to a ratchet wrench from his jacket. The implement was 30-40 cm long and was rusted.

(g)The Accused and Gary Hunter left the location for a period of about three minutes and then returned. Upon returning, the Accused was in possession of a black bum bag.

(h)The Accused then said, ""Fuck I forgot me Coke"". The Accused ran back in the same direction as before, returning shortly afterward with a can of Coca Cola. The Accused said, ""Lucky I got my fingerprints out of there ... He is in there laying down knocked the fuck out so I wiped the screen door and the wooden door"".

(i)The Accused then asked to be taken to the hospital.

(j)On the way to the hospital, Gary Hunter told the Accused, ""He won't be waking up nephew"".

(k)Before arriving at the hospital, the Accused and Gary Hunter needed to discard their weapons. They drove to Welwyn Street, Hebersham and the Accused placed the wrench and the bum bag in a storm water drain. They then drove to Bambara Crescent, Whalan and Gary Hunter threw his fence pole in a storm water drain at that location.

(l)Wade Hunter then dropped the Accused at Mt Druitt Hospital and returned home, arriving home at about 7.00 pm.

(m)During a visit to the Accused at the Silverwater Correctional Centre about three weeks after 20 June 2011, the Accused told Wade Hunter that, ""I've got nothing to worry about I never killed him"". The Accused then asked, ""Where are the [weapons]?"", to which Wade Hunter replied, ""You chucked them away"". The Accused said, ""The only way I will get done is if you fucking tell them or tell em where the [weapons] are"". Wade Hunter replied, ""Don't worry I haven't moved them"".

26Wade Hunter's representations as to his subjective state of mind at the time of the events on 20 June 2011 were that he believed the Accused was going to the home of a person named ""Bernie"" to obtain methadone and Xanax. He did not disclose any knowledge of the Accused having been struck on the head earlier in the afternoon, nor of any attempt by the Accused to exact revenge upon the person who struck him.

Submissions of the Parties

Submissions on Behalf of the Accused

27Mr Carroll submitted for the Accused that, having regard to the circumstances in which Wade Hunter made the previous representations now relied upon by the Crown, the Court could not find it likely that they were reliable.

28There were a number of matters relied upon by Mr Carroll in support of this submission. Counsel submitted that Wade Hunter was in a distressed state at the time of making his statement. He was in custody and his liberty was dependent on his assistance to police. Thus, he was motivated in a significant way by a desire to obtain bail. Counsel relied upon observations of Detective Sergeant Lowe given in his evidence at the Accused's committal. Detective Sergeant Lowe said that Wade Hunter appeared at the relevant time to be upset and crying. Counsel also submitted that Wade Hunter's criminal antecedents disclosed a history of violent offending, the effect of which was that Wade Hunter was potentially facing a lengthy custodial sentence in respect of the matters for which he was arrested on 2 September 2011. 

29It was also submitted that Wade Hunter was affected by drugs at times contemporaneous to the making of his statement of 2 September 2011, and that this was a factor bearing on the circumstances in which the statement was made. Wade Hunter's partner, Sabrina Ellingsworth, gave a statement to police as part of the investigation into Jason Dixon's death (dated 10 January 2012). In that statement she referred to events that took place on 1 and 2 September 2011, recounting in part:

""Around the 1 or 2 September 2011 I had an argument with Wade over singing over the car. He was on the drugs and carrying on. He ended up threatening to kill us and I called the police on him. He got locked up and he stayed away for about 3 weeks I remember he was home for the NRL Grand Final because he slept all day after drinking the night before, he only woke up just as the game finished. I'm not sure how long he stayed home for but I kicked him out again about a week before he passed away."" 

30Also bearing on the circumstances of the making of the statement, counsel for the Accused pointed to the prior inconsistent statements given by Wade Hunter in this matter. It was submitted that he had committed himself to a version of events different to that which he sought to assert on 2 September 2011. This, counsel submitted, demonstrated contempt on the part of Wade Hunter towards his obligation to tell the truth, thus bearing directly on the reliability of the 2 September 2011 statement.

31Finally, it was asserted that Wade Hunter knew police could link him to the movements of the Accused on 20 June 2011, he having told police he drove the Accused to the hospital, with the CCTV footage confirming it was his vehicle. It was suggested that this was a factor also bearing on the circumstances in which the representations were made.

32Tendered by the Crown on the present application was the evidence given at committal by Gary Hunter. This evidence corroborated aspects of the account given by Wade Hunter in his statement of 2 September 2011, namely the use of weapons and the disposing of those weapons. Counsel for the Accused submitted that, having regard to the authorities concerning what material is available for the determination of the reliability of the previous representations, the evidence of Gary Hunter cannot bear in any way on the circumstances in which Wade Hunter made his statement of 2 September 2011.

33There was another matter raised by counsel for the Accused at the hearing of the application that is somewhat distinct from the s.65(2)(d) issue. In relation to portions of Wade Hunter's statement of 2 September 2011 where the witness purports to recount comments made by the Accused to him, counsel submitted that these constitute second-hand admissions. It was submitted that they ought be excluded by operation of s.62 of the Act and the principles in Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60; 195 CLR 594.

Submissions of the Crown

34The Crown submitted that, at the time Wade Hunter made his statement on 2 September 2011, he was not a suspect in the investigation into Jason Dixon's death. Therefore, he had nothing to gain by establishing the Accused's guilt. In fact, the Crown suggested that there was very little actual benefit derived by Wade Hunter from the offering of his assistance. There was no monetary award, and there was little evidence to indicate that his offer of assistance directly resulted in a grant of bail. Whilst the Crown accepted that Detective Sergeant Lowe spoke with the police prosecutor in advance of the bail application, it was submitted that there was no evidence of a letter or any documentation provided by Detective Sergeant Lowe to the presiding Magistrate.

35In aid of its submission as to the reliability of the previous representations, the Crown pointed to the fact that the weapons described by Wade Hunter were, in fact, found in the locations specified by him. Photographs were tendered at the hearing of the application depicting the weapons in the relevant locations. A black bum bag containing the personal papers of Jason Dixon was also found at the location specified by Wade Hunter. The statement of Detective Leading Senior Constable Greg Griffin, who attended the drive-around, was also tendered. This, it was submitted, lent validity to the version of events given by Wade Hunter in his statement of 2 September 2011.

36In relation to the suggestion on behalf of the Accused that Wade Hunter was affected by drugs at the time of making his statement on 2 September 2011, the Crown submitted that a fair reading of the statement in its entirety reveals a rational, coherent sequence of events. It was submitted that there was no evidence of Wade Hunter labouring under the effect of drugs.

37As stated at [32] above, the Crown sought to rely on the evidence of Gary Hunter at the Accused's committal. It was submitted that this evidence was a matter the Court could take into account in assessing the reliability of the representations made by Wade Hunter.

38In respect of the submission put on behalf of the Accused that certain comments made by the Accused to Wade Hunter were inadmissible second-hand admissions, the Crown submitted that the relevant comments are properly characterised as either direct evidence of Wade Hunter or contemporaneous statements about the Accused's knowledge or state of mind, admissible pursuant to s.66A of the Act.

Resolution of the Primary Issue

39As stated at [8] above, the primary issue on this application is whether the representations of Wade Hunter in his statement of 2 September 2011 were made in circumstances that make it likely that the representations are reliable. I move now to a determination of that issue.

40The focus of this question is the ""circumstances"" in which the representations were made. This concept was considered in R v Ambrosoli [2002] NSWCCA 386; 55 NSWLR 603 at 609-616 [15]-[37]. After reviewing the authorities at 615 [29], Mason P (RS Hulme and Simpson JJ agreeing) observed that:

""...it does not necessarily follow that evidence of events other than those of the making of the previous representation cannot throw light upon the circumstances of the making of that representation and its reliability as affected thereby. Events subsequent to the representation being made might do this, for example a (genuine) express retraction by the maker of the previous representation, or evidence indicating that the person who made the previous representation was incapable of having heard or seen the matter which was the subject of the previous representation..""

41Thus, the concept of ""circumstances"" is not a narrow one. In assessing the present question, I am entitled to consider evidence of matters having occurred before or after the making of the previous representations, so long as they are relevant to the circumstances in which the representations were made. 

42The previous representations relied upon must be considered in context and as a whole: R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; 56 NSWLR 182 at 196 [93].

43The previous representations relied upon by the Crown fall into two categories. Firstly, they include representations about things Wade Hunter did and observed others doing. Secondly, they include things allegedly said to Wade Hunter by the Accused. The fact in issue in the proceedings to which these representations are said to go is the involvement of the Accused in the attack upon Jason Dixon that resulted in the latter's death. The evidence conveyed by the representations is clearly probative of that fact. The witness observed the Accused in possession of weapons and the bum bag. He also heard the Accused make significant admissions as to his involvement in a crime.

44The circumstances of the making of Wade Hunter's statement of 2 September 2011 include the following. He was in custody in relation to an unrelated matter and was apparently in an agitated state. His liberty was compromised and he had expressed a degree of desperation about obtaining bail. True it was that he attempted to bargain with police officers in this respect. There is also a suggestion he was affected by drugs at the relevant time. Further, I am required to take into account the fact that earlier statements made by him contradict the version he settled with on 2 September 2011. I also note that Wade Hunter was not formally cautioned in respect of the comments he was to make concerning the investigation into Jason Dixon's death and it has not been suggested by either counsel that he perceived himself to be a suspect in that investigation. Notwithstanding this, he clearly knew police could link him to the Accused's movements on 20 June 2011 through the use of his motor vehicle. I consider these to be the circumstances of the making of the previous representations relied upon by the Crown.

45The Crown concedes that there was at least a discussion between Detective Sergeant Lowe and the police prosecutor in respect of the Accused's bail application. The evidence of Detective Sergeant Lowe at the committal indicates that he advocated for the utility of Wade Hunter being released on bail, for the purpose of his assistance in the investigation then being undertaken into Jason Dixon's death. It remains, however, that no evidence has been furnished of any documentation that was provided to the presiding Magistrate in support of this. 

46There is significant persuasive force in the fact that Wade Hunter not only recounted a version of events, but was also able to take police to locations were weapons were allegedly discarded by the Accused and Gary Hunter. Photographs of the relevant weapons in the locations disclosed by Wade Hunter were tendered on the application. This material bears on the circumstances in which the statement of Wade Hunter was made, being objective evidence obtained shortly prior to the statement of witnesses which corroborates a significant aspect of the version of events given.

47As regards the question of whether Wade Hunter was drug affected at times contemporaneous to the making of his statement on 2 September 2011, the available evidence is tenuous. The only material on which such an assessment could be made is a brief description, given by Ms Ellingsworth in her statement of 10 January 2012, of an incident during which Wade Hunter was said to be ""on the drugs"". This was said to have occurred ""around ... 1 or 2 September"". The lack of specificity as to when this occurred, exactly what Wade Hunter was affected by and the extent to which he was affected, render this evidence of little assistance. Moreover, Detective Sergeant Lowe's observations of Wade Hunter at the Mt Druitt Police Station on 2 September 2011 do not assist the Accused. His evidence was that Wade Hunter was in a distressed state. Had Detective Sergeant Lowe harboured a suspicion that Wade Hunter was affected by drugs at the relevant time, this would likely have been documented in his statement. Further, I accept the Crown's submission that a fair and full reading of Wade Hunter's statement of 2 September 2011 discloses a relatively coherent and lucid account of what took place.

48It was submitted by counsel for the Accused that Wade Hunter's prior inconsistent statements in this matter detrimentally affect the reliability of the representations relied upon by the Crown. In R v Ambrosoli at 616 [36], Mason P stated that evidence of prior statements can be a matter bearing on an assessment of the circumstances in which previous representations are made. However, his Honour continued (at 616 [36]):

""I would, however, emphasise that prior or later statements or conduct of the person making the previous representation are only to be considered to the extent that they touch the reliability of the circumstances of the making of that previous representation. If they do no more than tend to address the asserted fact or ultimate issue they have no bearing on the issues presented by s 65(2).

49I am satisfied that the earlier inconsistent statements of Wade Hunter of 21 June 2011 and 22 July 2011 go to more than simply addressing the asserted fact. They demonstrate a consciousness on the part of the witness to minimise his involvement in the activities, and a concerted effort to conceal crimes he suspected to have taken place. I do not, however, consider that prior inconsistent statements automatically render it unlikely that the statement of 2 September 2011, in the circumstances in which it was made, was reliable. It is not uncommon in criminal trials for witnesses to give a version of events, having resiled from an earlier account. Ordinarily, the witness would be cross-examined on the earlier inconsistencies. Whilst Wade Hunter is not available for cross-examination, that does not preclude the tendering of the earlier inconsistent statements, and submissions being made to the jury as to the credibility of Wade Hunter as a witness. Furthermore, as I have already stated, there is objective evidence regarding the location of weapons and the bum bag that heavily supports the version of events given on 2 September 2011.

50Further, I am not persuaded that Wade Hunter's criminal antecedents bear in any probative way upon the present application. The assessment I am required to undertake is not one of the credibility of the relevant witness. That remains the task of the jury: R v Sio [2013] NSWSC 1412 at [54]; referring to R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [43]; R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at 236-237 [56]. The present question is whether the circumstances in which the representations were made render it likely that they are reliable.

51Counsel for the Accused did not articulate exactly how he relied on the witness' criminal record. It is difficult to see how a history of crimes of violence necessarily affects the circumstances in which Wade Hunter made his statement on 2 September 2011. That Wade Hunter knew he had a record and, thus, was potentially facing a serious sentence in respect of the matters for which he was in custody on 2 September 2011 may provide motivation for him to offer assistance to police - to obtain a more favourable outcome if and when he came to be sentenced for those matters. However, this, of itself, does not undermine the reliability of what he told police in providing assistance.

52The Crown has tendered on this application the evidence of Gary Hunter at the Accused's committal. This material is, in part, corroborative of the version of events given by Wade Hunter on 2 September 2011. Counsel for the Accused submitted that this was not material capable of bearing on an assessment of the circumstances in which the previous representations presently under consideration were made. 
 
53I accept the Accused's submission on this aspect. In R v El Masri [2010] NSWSC 1277 at [22], Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) said the following:

""In support of the proposition that the representations were admissible, the Crown pointed to evidence from other witnesses which was corroborative of the representations. In that regard, I agree with the submission of the defence that evidence going only to the reliability of the asserted fact is not the sort of evidence contemplated by s 65(2)(d)(ii) of the Act. What the section is directed to is whether the circumstances in which the representations were made, rendered it unlikely that the representations were fabrications (R v Ambrosoli [2002] NSWCCA 386 at [28-41]). Nevertheless, all that needs to be established is that 'the circumstances make it likely'. This, of course, is to be contrasted with the requirement in s 65(2)(c) of 'high probability'..""

54Here the asserted facts are that, on 20 June 2011, the Accused armed himself and Gary Hunter with weapons, that he directed Wade Hunter to drive to a certain location and that, after leaving for a short time, he returned and the weapons were then discarded in storm water drains. The relevance on this application of the evidence of Gary Hunter at committal goes only to corroboration of aspects of this evidence and, thereby, the reliability of the asserted facts. The Crown did not submit that another use may be made of that material. Therefore, I do not consider that it should bear on my assessment.

55As part of the task required under s.65(2)(d), I have had regard for the fact that Wade Hunter was potentially criminally involved in the events of 20 June 2011. By his own account, there were questions as to his liability as an accessory both before and after the fact to the attack on Jason Dixon. I accept that his various statements contain a degree of minimisation of his role in the events. Nevertheless, Wade Hunter was never charged with any offences arising from the investigation into Jason Dixon's death. In fact, it does not appear as though it was ever communicated to him that he was a suspect. Accordingly, it does not appear that there was anything to be gained by him in inculpating his brother, given the risk of adverse consequences for himself.

56I turn to the issue raised by counsel for the Accused with respect to what he described as second-hand admissions in the statement of 2 September 2011. In my view, comments made by the Accused to Wade Hunter on 20 June 2011 tending to inculpate him are not properly characterised as second hand. Were he available, it would be appropriate for the Crown to adduce evidence of those admissions through him. That he is unavailable to give evidence does not make his evidence second hand. By operation of s.65(2), any admissions contained in Wade Hunter's statement of 2 September 2011 are admissible accounts of what he saw and observed. I do not consider that Lee v The Queen bears on this question. Further, I accept the Crown submission that s.66A of the Act supports the Crown on this issue.

57The assessment to be undertaken by me requires a balancing of all material bearing on the circumstances in which the previous representations were made. In my view, the representations relied upon by the Crown are admissible under s.65(2)(d) of the Act. I am satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances in which they were made, it is likely that the representations are reliable. 

Consideration of Section 137

58Having found the previous representations contained in Wade Hunter's statement of 2 September 2011 admissible pursuant to s.65(2)(d), there remains the question of whether they ought nevertheless be excluded under s.137 of the Act.

59Section 137 states as follows:

""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

60The probative value of the representations contained in Wade Hunter's statement of 2 September 2011 is substantial. It corroborates important aspects of the account given by Gary Hunter. The evidence of Wade and Gary Hunter together is most important evidence in support of the Crown case that the Accused was involved in the attack on Jason Dixon. Additionally, the evidence comes from the Accused's own brother. If accepted by the jury, this fact alone may render the evidence of great weight: R v El Masri at [36].

61Further, the account of Wade Hunter places the Accused in possession of the black bum bag (later found to contain Jason Dixon's personal papers) on the night of 20 June 2011. This, in conjunction with the fact that Wade Hunter took police to locations where this and the weapons allegedly used on 20 June 2011 were discarded, is highly probative of the Accused's involvement in the attack. Finally, the statement of 2 September 2011 contains a number of significant admissions made by the Accused.

62Courts have repeatedly recognised that the unfair prejudice spoken of in s.137 is not simply the tendency of admissible evidence to inculpate an accused person: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91]; Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at 603 [22]. The operative term is ""unfair"". This requires a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way.

63Counsel for the Accused submitted that a forensic advantage was lost by Wade Hunter not being available for cross-examination. This is a factor which may properly be taken into account for the purpose of s.137. However, the fact that an accused person is unable to cross-examine a Crown witness is not decisive in the assessment that must be undertaken: R v Suteski at 201 [126]. It may be taken that Gary Hunter will be available for cross-examination. Further, the earlier inconsistent statements of Wade Hunter will be available to the Accused for tender.

64I am not satisfied that the very substantial probative value of the representations contained in Wade Hunter's statement of 2 September 2011 is outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. I have kept in mind the usual directions that are given to a jury in relation to evidence of this sort. Such directions will ordinarily address: 

(a)the fact that Wade Hunter is someone who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings: s.165 of the Act;

(b)the fact the evidence will be untested in cross-examination: El Masri at [38]; Suteski at 201-202 [130]-[131];

(c)the fact that benefits may potentially have been received for the giving of the evidence.

65Accordingly, I refuse to exclude the evidence under s.137 of the Act.

Orders

66For these reasons:

(a)I overrule the objection by the Accused to the tender by the Crown of the contents of the statement of Wade Hunter dated 2 September 2011;

(b)I rule that the representations identified by the Crown in the statement of Wade Hunter dated 2 September 2011 satisfy the requirements of s.65(1) and (2) Evidence Act 1995.

(c)the Accused's Notice of Motion filed on 28 October 2013 is dismissed.

		03 September 2014",2013-12-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762895,Wilken v R [2013] NSWCCA 304,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA: The applicant, Levon Wilken, was convicted of the ""specially aggravated"" offence of kidnapping and was liable to imprisonment for 25 years: Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 86(3) (""Crimes Act""). The sentence imposed by Freeman ADCJ was 7 years, 2 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years, 2 months.  The applicant sought leave to challenge this sentence on the basis that the non-parole period was so much longer than that of a co-accused, found by the sentencing judge (who sentenced both) to bear equal responsibility for the offending, as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  The applicant further sought to complain that the trial judge had not adequately explained the basis of the difference.
2It is convenient to deal with the second point first. The basis for the differential treatment was clear.  Each offender was sentenced by the judge to periods of imprisonment for a number of offences, which included, in each case, two common offences and two separate matters.  For each offender, the sentencing judge sought to ensure that the balance of term was approximately one-third of the mandatory period of imprisonment.  That proportion reflects the limit for a particular sentence, absent special circumstances, provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). (""Sentencing Act""). It is an entirely legitimate application of sentencing principle.
3In written submissions, counsel for the applicant accepted that this might have been the rationale underlying the approach adopted by the sentencing judge but said that if this were so, ""then this is an error and the correct approach would have been to impose the same non-parole period, and to partly accumulate that sentence on the earlier imposed sentences"": written submissions, par 29.  It is true that the same effective result could have been achieved by that means.  However, both approaches were available and neither was necessarily preferable.  The equivalent moral culpability of each offender was reflected in the imposition of identical overall sentences.  No error was revealed by the approach adopted by the sentencing judge.
4Nothing said so far reveals any basis for granting leave to appeal.  The background to the offending (which was undoubtedly serious), the subjective circumstances of the offenders and details of the offences for which each was sentenced, as set out by Campbell J in his reasons, provides no better basis for a grant of leave.
5The Court should refuse leave to appeal.  If leave is granted, the appeal should be dismissed.
6PRICE J:  I have had the advantage of considering the draft judgments of Basten JA and Campbell J.  As their Honours point out, the sentencing judge was seeking to ensure that the statutory ratio was maintained in relation to the overall effective sentences to be imposed on the applicant and Carroll.  The applicant has not established a justifiable sense of grievance.  I agree with Campbell J that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed. 
7CAMPBELL J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from one component of the sentence passed on him by Freeman ADCJ in the District Court on 20th January 2012. The component about which the applicant is aggrieved is the non-parole period imposed as part of a sentence of imprisonment for an offence occurring on 14th January 2010 of taking and detaining a female victim for advantage in its specially aggravated form under s.86(3) Crimes Act, in that at the time she was taken, actually bodily harm was occasioned to her.
8The sentence for the s.86 offence was one of three sentences passed on the applicant by the sentencing judge. He was also sentenced on the call-up of a bond under s.9 of the Sentencing Act of two years imposed on 5th December 2008 for an offence of stealing property in a dwelling house contrary to s.148 Crimes Act. That offending occurred on 12th August 2007. The other sentence related to a charge of common assault of a male victim, which immediately preceded the s.86 offence.
9The applicant's substantial complaint is that a marked and unjustified disparity exists between the non-parole period imposed on him for the s.86 offence compared with that imposed on one of two co-offenders for the same offence, a man named Carroll. There is no complaint about the sentence passed on the other co-offender, Sheen. Alternatively he complains that the reasons given by the learned sentencing judge were inadequate to explain the difference between the two non-parole periods and, in any event, that the sentence passed was manifestly excessive.
The sentences imposed
10The sentences imposed on the applicant are as follows:
(a)On the call-up for the breach of his bond, a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 12th October 2010 and expiring on 11th October 2011 to be served concurrently with a 6 month sentence imposed in the Local Court commencing on 12th October 2010 for other offences;
(b)For the common assault, a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months commencing on 12th October 2011 and expiring on 11th January 2012; and
(c)For the s.86 offence, a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 5 years and 2 months, commencing on 12th January 2012 and expiring on 11th March 2017 with an additional term of 2 years commencing on 12th March 2017 and expiring on 11th March 2019.
11Freeman ADCJ dealt with Carroll on the same day. Earlier that day he had been sentenced by his Honour for an offence of dangerous driving occasioning death. He was then sentenced at the same time as the applicant for the assault and s.86 offence, together with five related offences brought up into the District Court under s.166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Chronologically, the sentences are as follows:
(a)For the dangerous driving occasioning death, a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 23rd February 2010 and expiring on 22nd November 2013, with an additional term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 23rd November 2013 and expiring on 22nd February 2015;
(b)For the five s.166 offences, concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of varying lengths, each commencing on 20th January 2012, the longest of which, for the unauthorised possession of a police uniform, was of 2 months duration, expiring on 19th March 2012;
(c)For the common assault, a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months commencing 23rd June 2013 and expiring on 22nd September 2013;
(d)For the s.86 offence, a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 23rd September 2013 and expiring on 22nd March 2018, with an additional term of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 23rd March 2018 and expiring on 22nd November 2020.
12The total effective sentence for the applicant's offending was one of 8 years and 5 months, having a non-parole period of 6 years and 5 months.  For Carroll, the total effective sentence was 10 years and 9 months, having a non-parole period of 8 years and 1 month. One should not lose sight of the consideration that Carroll is required to spend an additional period of 20 months in gaol before he becomes eligible for parole compared to the applicant.
Summary of the facts
13The male victim owed Sheen $200. There is no evidence of the circumstances in which that debt was incurred. The male victim had been uncontactable, he said, because of mobile phone difficulties. When Sheen finally got onto him, he insisted on a meeting at a service station in Sydney's southern suburbs.
14The male victim suspected trouble and arranged for his partner, the female victim, to drive him to a place near the service station. After concealing the car nearby, with his partner ready to drive him away if necessary, the male victim approached the service station on foot. On his arrival at the service station, his suspicions were justified when he saw that Sheen had brought two other males - the applicant and Carroll - to the meeting. Sheen walked towards him and invited him to get into the car. When the male victim declined, Sheen was insistent, using violent language, and was supported verbally by Carroll. Sheen swung a punch at the male victim, missing him. The male victim then ran away, pursued by the applicant. He did not return to his partner's car, but ran further down the road managing to gain a lead that enabled him to hide himself in a driveway. During the chase, the applicant was carrying an object in his right hand, which he later claimed was a beer bottle. The co-offenders eventually abandoned their search for the male victim. From his hiding place, he sent a text message to his partner, warning her to go home. These facts constituted the assault. As the sentencing judge observed, none of the co-offenders actually touched the male victim.
15The female victim felt uncomfortable waiting and drove from her hiding place.  When they spotted her, the three co-offenders instructed their driver, a young woman, who was dealt with separately, and about whose sentence the applicant makes no parity complaint, to give chase.
16The female victim was forced to halt by the pursuit vehicle running her into the side of the road, blocking her passage.
17After the female victim stopped, the three co-offenders ran towards, and crowded around, her car. Carroll apparently had taken command. One of them opened the unlocked driver's door. Carroll grabbed the female victim by the hair, pulling her face close to his and aggressively yelling an inquiry about the whereabouts of the male victim, which she did not know. Carroll would not accept this. He accused her of lying and struck her across the face a number of times. A passing motorist, who is to be commended for interrupting his journey to retrace his steps to report the matter at the nearest police station, witnessed this confrontation.
18The co-offenders got in the female victim's car and continued to question her about the whereabouts of the male victim, asserting that she was lying to them. She was extremely scared and in her fear offered to drive them to the home of the male victim's brother. They directed her to do this, continuing to threaten her during the journey. At their destination, Carroll demanded and was given the car keys so the female victim was unable to flee when the three co-offenders approached the premises. When they returned to the car, the applicant took a piece of material he found on the back seat and used it as a ligature around the female victim's neck, forcing her head back against the seat and choking her. While this was occurring, Carroll threatened that she would be choked to death; that she would be killed and buried where no one could find her; that she would be disfigured.
19The female victim was roughly hauled into the back seat and made to crouch in the seat well with a jacket over her head. The choking ceased.
20In her fear, the female victim agreed to attempt to contact the male victim, and her mobile phone, which had previously been taken from her, was returned for this purpose. The male victim did not reply to the initial text message. The applicant attempted to reassure her that she would not be harmed if she co-operated, but Carroll indicated otherwise.
21In the meantime, the male victim had left his hiding place and went looking for the female victim, who, he discovered, had abandoned the hiding place where he had left her and her car. He then received the phone call from her, which she had been directed to make by the co-offenders. Under their instruction, she did not let on she had been taken by them and the male victim arranged to meet her at a nearby aquatic centre. Before the co-offenders could spring their trap they sighted a patrolling police car and abandoned their plan, absconding and leaving the female victim alone still crouching in the rear seat well of her car.
22When she eventually looked up, she saw the co-offenders walking away. She got into the driver's seat and drove off. She saw a parked police car. The officers were speaking to the young woman who had been driving the offenders' car. In her hysterical and terrified state, the female victim approached the police officers and asked for help. They observed she was sweating, appeared to have been crying, was shaking and could not stand still. She said, ""they're going to kill me, they're after me"". The officers observed the red mark around her neck. She was taken to the police station, where the injuries of a soft tissue nature to her face, neck and upper body were recorded.
23Sheen and Carroll were arrested on 15th January 2010, when the female victim was assisting police in an attempt to recreate the events of the previous evening. She pointed them out. They were arrested, declining to be interviewed. They were charged and taken into custody on 21st January 2010.
24The applicant was not taken into custody until 6th October 2010, when he was arrested in relation to subsequent offending. He denied any knowledge of this offence, but a DNA profile matching his had been detected during the investigation and whilst in custody he made admissions during lawfully intercepted telephone calls.
The subjective circumstances of the offenders
25The applicant was born in October 1987, was 22 years of age at the time of the offending, and 24 when sentenced. His criminal history includes other violent crimes extending to common assault, stalking and intimidating, making threats over the telephone, stealing property in a dwelling house, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and a further offence of stalking and intimidating, subsequent to January 2010.
26He had generally been treated leniently in the past, including by way of bonds. At the time of this offending he was subject a bond of two years imposed in respect of the offence of stealing in a dwelling house; a charge to which he pleaded guilty after a charge bargain was made. That offence had been accompanied by an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, for which he was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. As the sentencing judge noted, of real concern was that this couplet of offences related to the applicant lending assistance in the collection of a debt. In other words acting as a kind of ""stand-over man"", as again in this case.
27For a late plea, on the second day fixed for trial, the applicant received a utilitarian discount ""in the order of 10 per cent"".
28It appears that the sentencing judge did not accept the evidence tendered to establish that the applicant was deeply remorseful and had developed insight into his past activities including drug use. This material consisted of evidence from his father, references from community supporters and a report from a forensic psychologist. It seems that an essentially similar case had been put before the District Court when the bond was imposed on 5th December 2008, which the applicant breached by committing these offences. The sentencing judge found he had lied then when he said he had given up drugs. Moreover, the applicant had continued to offend until he was taken into custody. The learned judge found that there was no easy or quick fix to transform the applicant into a productive and law-abiding member of the community, and at best, his prospects of rehabilitation were no more than fair, notwithstanding offers of employment in his roof tiling trade, and the birth of a child to his partner.
29When sentenced, Carroll was aged 41. His criminal record has not been provided to this Court and is not detailed in the sentencing judge's reasons because he had dealt with it in his reasons for imposing his sentence in his serious driving charge earlier that day. I infer from what was said in the proceedings on sentence that his record extended to other crimes of violence.
30He too received a ten per cent discount for a late plea. The trial judge accepted psychological evidence that Carroll had suffered an abusive and destabilising childhood at the hands of his violent father. He developed psychological problems because of his perception of his inability to defend his sister and mother from his father, which led to substance and alcohol abuse. He was estranged from his immediate family.
31His psychological problems had been made worse by business failures, apparently through no fault of his own, and on account of the fact that the victim of the serious driving offence was a young friend, whose death produced a post traumatic stress disorder from which Carroll was still suffering and for which he required treatment.
32His Honour recorded that Carroll ""had busied himself commendably in undertaking courses and in securing and succeeding in employment whilst in gaol"". He had regained ""the religion from which he had previously lapsed"".
Reasons for sentence
33His Honour found that whilst not in the worst category, the offending of the co-offenders was ""a very serious example of the aggregated form of offence under s.86(3)"". His Honour found that, fortunately, the physical injuries suffered by the female victim had been relatively minor, but that the psychological trauma ""has had severe ongoing consequences, including [on] her ability to hold down employment. There can be no doubt that the emotional harm done to her is significant."" He found, however, that the s.86(3) offence was ""improvised rather than organised"".
34In dealing with the issue of parity, his Honour said [AB p21]:
It seems to me that the roles played by each of the offenders does not provide much material to differentiate between them.  Sheen must have been the instigator because he was the one attempting to collect money from [the male victim]. Carroll appears to have taken the lead in terms of directing their activities and being the first to assault [the female victim]. Wilken was the one who strangled her and kept her down with her head covered and none is entitled to be regarded as significantly less culpable than his fellows.
35When passing sentence on Carroll for the offences in common with the applicant, his Honour said this [AB p32]:
... whilst [the sentence for assault] is cumulative upon part of the sentence delivered earlier today, it is also partly concurrent with that sentence. This is in deference to the principle of totality, although the crimes themselves are completely different. Your plea has earned you a deduction of ten months.  
On the specially aggravated kidnapping charge, I set a commencement date of 23 September 2013. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, with a balance of 2 years and 8 months.
The special circumstances I found in your case are the accumulation of your sentences. The balance is then adequate to address your rehabilitation in the community.  You will be eligible for release to supervised parole as from 22 March 2018. Your sentence will expire in its entirety on 22 November 2012.
36Of the applicant, his Honour said [AB p 33]:
...in your case I found the special circumstances of this sentence being accumulated on the sentence earlier indicated [on the call up of the bond]. I therefore impose on you a sentence for the assault on [the male victim] ... of three months, to date from 12 October 2011. The sentence to expire on 11 January 2012.
On the charge of specially aggravated detain for advantage, I sentence you to a non-parole period of 5 years 2 months, to date from 12 January 2012. You will be eligible for release to supervised parole as from 11 March 2017. The balance of sentence is 2 years. The sentence will expire on 11 March 2019.
The appeal
37The focus of the proposed appeal relates to the non-parole period component of the sentence for the s.86 offence. In the applicant's case and in the case of Sheen the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 5 years and 2 months. In the case of Carroll, the non-parole period imposed was 4 years and 6 months. Mr J Trevallion of counsel, who appeared for the applicant, argued that this difference in this component of the sentencing structures offends the ""parity principle"" requiring that like offenders should be treated in a like manner:  Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 743 [28]. Counsel acknowledged that the principle ""allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances"" (Green at 473 [28]). He argued, however, that even if this flexible exception has been engaged, the learned sentencing judge made an error of law by failing adequately to state reasons identifying the relevant difference and its effect. For this reason the applicant remained entitled to be aggrieved. Counsel also said the sentence is manifestly excessive, which latter ground was permitted to be advanced orally by leave of the Court. With respect to counsel, it must be said that this third ground was advanced but faintly. This is understandable given that ""a ground of appeal based on disparity operates... in respect of sentences within the appropriate range"": OM v R [2009] NSWCCA 267; 212 A Crim R 532 at [7] per Basten JA.
38The Crown acknowledged that the parity principle applies to all aspects of a sentence including the non-parole period, but submitted that the principle is concerned with ameliorating a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the co-offender. Disparity occasioned by operation of law can give rise to no justifiable sense of grievance: R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253 at [15] - [16]; R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209 at [17] - [19]. In the present case, the relevant law was the principle of totality, and the necessity to accommodate the finding of special circumstances. That the effect of accumulation across a number of sentences may constitute special circumstances is clearly established: R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 121, 136; Simpson v R (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 at 60 - 61.
39The Crown argued that passages quoted at [35]-[36] above demonstrate that this is the approach the sentencing judge took. The need to sentence each of the applicant and Carroll by having regard to the separate offending of them both provided a relevant difference between them justifying a degree of disparity in fixing the non-parole period for each of them for the s.86(3) offence.
40The Crown accepted the judge had an obligation to provide reasons, but argued that he discharged that duty by explaining his approach to his finding of special circumstances in the case of each of the applicant and Carroll.
41So far as manifest excess was concerned, the Crown said the argument could not be seriously entertained having regard to the sentencing judge's findings as to the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending, the prospects of rehabilitation being only ""fair"", the aggravating circumstance of committing the offence in breach of a previous bond, and the subsequent offending also in breach of the bond. The latter consideration showing an on-going attitude of disobedience of the law. 
Decision
42The parity principle is well established. In Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 301 Dawson and Gaudron JJ described the principle as:
An aspect of equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them (Emphasis added).
In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at 473 [28], the plurality said:
As with the norm of ""equal justice"", which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances.  (Emphasis added)
43Demonstration of disparity depends upon satisfaction of an objective standard, that is to say, the appellant needs to satisfy this Court that ""the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance of justice not being done"": Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 609 - 610 per Gibbs CJ.
44It may be accepted that relevant disparity in non-parole periods or in the relationship between non-parole periods and total effective terms is capable of satisfying that objective standard: Stewart v R [2013] NSWCCA 185 at [46].
45In the case of Carroll and the applicant, the totality of the offending for which they were being sentenced was relevantly different. Carroll had the dangerous driving occasioning death charge and the applicant faced sentence on the call-up on his bond. In each case, the sentencing judge was required to approach his task in accordance with the dictates of the well-known passage in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 623 [4] - [5]; that is to say, as he was sentencing each offender for more than one offence, his Honour was required to first fix an appropriate sentence for each offence ""and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality"". One reason why it is necessary ""to ensure proper sentencing on each count"" is to avoid ""artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders"": Pearce at 624 [48].
46At the same time, I am conscious of the statement of Howie J in Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [33] that in applying Pearce, the preservation of proper parity between co-offenders needs to be borne in mind, and ""may itself amount to special circumstances"". But the function of a finding of special circumstances may be to preserve the statutory ratio in an appropriate case. It need not always be to ameliorate it: Moffitt at 136; Simpson at 60-61.
47In my judgment the relevant differences to which I have referred, which were clearly identified by the sentencing judge, fully justified the imposition of a different non-parole period for the s.86(3) offence on each offender in the context of the requirement of accumulation across a number of separate sentences in order to accommodate and reflect the principle of totality and preserve the statutory ratio established by s.44 Sentencing Act: Gray v R [2013] NSWCCA 169 at [42].
48It is a settled and entrenched principle that the provision of reasons supporting a decision is an incident of the exercise of judicial power, especially by the courts of ordinary jurisdiction. This duty extends, of course, to sentencing. In so far as the content of that duty is concerned, it is probably sufficient for present purposes to adapt the reasoning of the High Court expressed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [29] - [30], albeit in the context of s.54B(4) Sentencing Act, that the duty requires ""the judge to identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed"". The purpose of the rule may be taken to be to inform the offender why he has received the sentence imposed, assist appellate review, promote consistency in sentencing generally and to ""increase public awareness of the sentencing process"". None of this should be taken as suggesting that judicial reasons in this area need to be especially elaborate, complex or detailed. Indeed, such an approach is more likely to obscure than clarify, especially when one bears in mind the purposes of informing the offender and the public.  From the standpoint of appellate review, reasons need to be read fairly and as a whole, without an eye too keenly attuned to the detection of error: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 456; 43 FCR 280 at 287. Pozzolanic is an administrative law case but the principle is apposite, at least in a general way, to judicial decisions: Hall v Van der Poel [2009] NSWCA 436 at [54].   
49To my mind, the passages from the sentencing judge's reasons, set out [35]-[36] above, clearly and adequately state the ground on which his Honour differentiated between Carroll and the applicant in fixing the non-parole period for the s.86(3) offence. It would be clear to any reasonably informed reader that his Honour fixed different non-parole periods to take account of the requirements of Pearce relating to questions of concurrence, accumulation and totality, and in that context the preservation of the s.44 ratio. I would reject the second ground of appeal.
50I have already remarked that there are difficulties in successfully arguing that a sentence is manifestly excessive when one's principal complaint invokes parity, because a parity complaint proceeds on the assumption that the sentence is otherwise appropriate. I am not satisfied that the sentence passed on the applicant is in any respect wholly unreasonable. The Crown submissions in this regard should be accepted. When one has regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, the aggravating factor of the commission of serious offences whilst subject to a bond, the applicant's criminal history before and after these offences, and his only fair prospects of rehabilitation, I am satisfied that the sentences imposed both individually and in toto were within an appropriate range. I am not of the opinion that another less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. The orders I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal granted;
(2)Appeal dismissed.

2762903,Tonette Kelly v Regina [2013] NSWDC 252,"Judgment


Intorduction

1Tonette Kelly appeals against her convictions for two offences:

(1)That on 20 April 2010 whilst she was a person giving evidence at a public enquiry conducted by the Independent Commission against Corruption did give evidence that was false in a material particular, namely that she was granted approval by Chief Executive Officer Matthew Taylor in March 2003 to use the Legalco account in order to conduct searches for private purposes, knowing such evidence was false.

(2)That on 20 April 2010 whilst she was a person giving evidence at a public enquiry conducted by the Independent Commission against Corruption did give evidence that was false in a material particular, namely that she engaged Nicolai Dacombe, as a paralegal on a part-time basis between 24 March 2005 and 18 September 2008 within her own private legal practice, knowing such evidence was false.


2Miss Kelly pleaded not guilty to both charges.

3She appeared before Magistrate Anthony Townsden in the Local Court over a period of 10 sitting days. On 1 May 2013 His Honour found both offences proved and convicted the appellant of both offences.

4I am now required to determine this case in accordance with the principles enunciated by Mason P in Charara v the Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244, particularly at paragraphs 17,18 and 19:
""17 The appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcripts (s18(1)), obviously supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Fresh evidence may be given by leave, subject to the District Court being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this should occur (s18(2).

18 The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The Judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court (Bell v Stewart (1920) 28 CLR 419 at 424-5, Paterson v Paterson (1953) 89 CLR 212, Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118).

19 The nature of an appeal ""by way of rehearing"" has been discussed in many cases. The procedure to be adopted, powers to be exercised and function to be performed must first be sought in the language of the particular statute. One thing, however, is clear. ""The 'rehearing' does not involve a completely fresh hearing by the appellate court of all the evidence. That court proceeds on the basis of the record and any fresh evidence that, exceptionally, it admits"" (Fox at 118[22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ). Referring to the ""requirements, and limitations, of such an appeal"", their Honours continued (at [23], footnotes omitted):
... On the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to ""give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance"". On the other, it must, of necessity, observe the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the ""feeling"" of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.""

5This requires me to pay careful regard to the reasons of the learned Magistrate since he saw and heard all of the witnesses and clearly was in a better position than me to evaluate credibility.

The Charges

6I propose to deal first with the first charge.

7Tonette Kelly was the senior legal officer at the Maritime Services Authority at all relevant times and was regarded highly as a skilled lawyer and someone who gave sound advice. Over time, she developed an interest in maintaining her own legal business, separate from that of Authority. As she was a public servant, she was bound by the need to seek agreement to engage in secondary employment. 

8For some time she carried out some conveyancing work at her home, doing very little in fact. Initially, she advertised herself in her local areas as being a solicitor who did conveyancing, but in the course of time, she set up and maintained a much more extensive legal practice. In a physical sense it was conducted at her home in Schofields, where she relied to a great extent on work carried out by her sister.

9Solicitors and conveyancers in New South Wales frequently make use of the services of a company known as Espreon, formerly known as Legalco, a company that carries out searches on databases maintained by the Registrar General's Department, and various statutory authorities. These searches are necessary to obtain details such as the ownership of land, mortgages and other charges, caveats, zoning of land and the charges imposed by various statutory authorities.

10The Espreon database is capable of being searched by any person who becomes a subscriber. Naturally, it charges for its services. The Authority had an account with Espreon because the Authority owned a considerable amount of real property and from time to time sold or leased some of that property. The appellant and lawyers in the legal branch knew what services were provided by Espreon and that the Authority paid for those services. However, I am satisfied that none of the chief executives of the Authority had any knowledge of Espreon or what it did, nor did any of them understand what was involved in conducting conveyancing transactions.

11The hearing of the prosecutions before the Local Court occupied some 10 days of hearing. Miss Kelly claimed that she had Authority at all times to use the Espreon account and that this Authority had been specifically granted to her in 2003 by the then chief executive, Matthew Taylor.

12I am satisfied that Mr Taylor did not grant any such Authority. What he did was to permit her to engage in secondary employment because he understood it involved her doing a small amount of conveyancing work for members of her family and some staff of the Authority. She led him to understand that she would be making a few phone calls a week and perhaps receiving or sending a few documents. She did not tell him at any time, nor did she tell anyone else working for the Authority, that she would be using its Espreon account at the expense of the Authority for the purpose of conducting her private business.

13Mr Taylor gave the approval for secondary employment in a memorandum of 7th March 2003.

14In 2004, Mr Oxenbould, his successor as chief executive, following anonymous complaints being received that the appellant was conducting a conveyancing business and using the resources of the Authority, directed that an Inquiry be conducted by a Mr Clarke, barrister-at-Law. At Mr Clarke's invitation, the appellant provided a statement in which she said that she had approval for secondary employment, that the conveyancing work she was carrying out was not extensive and she forwarded the memorandum of 7 March 2003.

15When allegations were made subsequently that led to an Inquiry of the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC), she provided written material claiming that she had permission to conduct conveyancing activities and that permission included the right to use a database at the expense of the Authority, known as Legalco. This database subsequently became known as Espreon.

16The ICAC Inquiry was concerned with whether she had Authority to use the Espreon database and she made a statement, enclosing a memorandum of 20 March 2003. This memorandum purported to be signed by Mr Taylor and to have the word ""approved"" placed on it. The body of the memorandum contained a request by the appellant for consent to use the Legalco database for the purposes of her conveyancing business and on the basis that she would reimburse the Authority for the cost of its use.

17The appellant gave evidence at the ICAC Inquiry and maintained that the memorandum of 20 March 2003 was genuine and that Mr Taylor had signed it and placed the word ""approved"" on it.

18Much of the evidence that the ICAC Inquiry turned on whether the memorandum of 20 March 2003 was genuine. Mr Taylor gave evidence that he did not sign this document and that evidence was supported by others in the Authority. He also denied placing the word ""approved"" on the document. What was significant about this document was that if it were a genuine document, then the appellant was justified in using the Legalco database. If the document were not genuine, then she had no Authority to use the database.

19The extent of her conveyancing business was also the subject of evidence at the Inquiry. Indeed officers of ICAC attended her home and seized a large quantity of records, including records of legal work that she had conducted over a number of years. However the Inquiry essentially focused on the question did she have permission to use the Legalco database. It was not investigating, except as a secondary matter, whether she had an approval for secondary employment

20The memorandum on which she relied was not produced to Mr Clarke during his Inquiry and he was given no information about it. She was questioned about this at the ICAC Inquiry. She maintained the memorandum was in existence at the time but she did not produce it to Mr Clarke because it was not relevant.

21In my opinion, what she said about this was unconvincing and improbable. If this document had been in existence at the time of Mr Clarke's Inquiry, it would have been extremely relevant, because it would have shown that Mr Taylor not only approved of her having secondary employment, but also approved of her using the Authority's funds to access the Espreon database. It also would have shown that she had claimed to Mr Taylor and he agreed with her claim, that she was entitled to offset the costs of using the Espreon database against a large amount of unpaid overtime she had accumulated. 

22Miss Novotny, an expert in handwriting and the forgery of documents examined the two memoranda and concluded that the word ""approved"" in the memorandum of 20 March 2003 was a copy of a word from some other document and that, accordingly, this document was a forgery. In my opinion, ICAC were entitled to act on that opinion of Miss Novotny. The learned Magistrate also accepted the evidence of Miss Novotny and was clearly entitled to do so. I accept the evidence of Miss Novotny

23Subsequently, after she had given evidence before ICAC, she produced two stamps that he said had been placed in her home letterbox by an unknown person. Those stamps were the subject of expert examination and subsequent evidence by Mr Paul Westwood, a well-known document examiner. One of the stamps had the word ""approved"" on it and it could have been used to stamp that word on documents. However Mr Westwood concluded that the manner in which the stamp reproduced the word ""approved"" on a document meant that it was not used to produce the word ""approved"" on the document of 20 March 2003. He further examined the manufacture of the stamp and concluded that it was made in 2012 and that it had scratches on metal parts of the body, designed in his opinion to convey the impression that the stamp was an old and well-worn one.

24The magistrate was clearly entitled to accept the evidence of Mr Westwood and to conclude that the stamps could not have been used to put the word"" approved"" on the document of 20 March 2003. Clearly, this stamp could not have been used to produce the word ""approved"" on the memorandum of 20th March 2003. Apart from this evidence, Mr Taylor denied using a stamp to put the word ""approved"" on the document of 20 March 2003.

25Another claim made by the appellant was that she obtained the approval on 20 March 2003 on the basis that she was working a large amount of unpaid overtime and this could be offset against any debt she had for the use of the database. Mr Taylor gave evidence that he knew nothing of this. This question was put to other witnesses and it was established clearly that this claim was unknown to Mr Dunn, the CEO of the time of the ICAC enquiry nor was it known to Mr Robinson, the appellant's supervisor who gave evidence that there was never any discussion with her about offsetting wages so that she could use the Legalco/ Espreon database.

26Miss Ohanian, the human resources manager of the Authority saw the memorandum of 7 March 2003, but only one page of it was on the file and she did not see the memorandum of 20 March 2003 until the ICAC hearing. She was also of the opinion that there was no way in which an employee could offset over time against the use of resources of the Authority and she said that she could not imagine the CEO giving such approval.

27Jill Saffron, an office manager, confirmed that she had seen the memorandum of 7 March without any attachments. Brian Stanwell, a previous supervisor of the appellant said that at no point did the appellant raise as an issue, the offsetting of over time against the use of resources, nor did she ever discuss secondary employment.

28All of this evidence, in my opinion, enables me to say that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the document of 20 March 2003 is a forgery that was prepared by the appellant for the purposes of the ICAC hearing. It did not exist before that time. This finding coincides with identical findings of ICAC and the learned Magistrate.

29I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at no time did the appellant raises anyone in authority her entitlement to offset overtime against the use of resources. I would add, that the appellant admitted in evidence that she did not at any time pay any money back to the Authority to compensate for her use of the Espreon database.

30There is no doubt in my opinion that the appellant gave false evidence before the ICAC as was claimed by the prosecution before the Local Court.

31I am fortified in my opinions by the findings of the learned magistrate (now a judge of this Court). His opinions coincide with my opinions. He did not accept the appellant as a credible witness. Nor do I.

Second charge

32By the time of the hearing before the Local Court, the appellant admitted that she had given false evidence before the ICAC in which she said that she had engaged Mr Dacombe as a paralegal for a period of three years on a part-time basis, knowing that the evidence was false.

33However she also raised before the Local Court a defence of duress. I have considered the reasons of the learned Magistrate in relation to this matter and I find myself in complete agreement with what he has said. None of the facts alleged by her were of such a character as to enable her to claim that there was a threat of such a kind as would drive a reasonable person to act as she did. Like the magistrate, I am of the opinion that if there was a threat of some kind there was ample opportunity for her to take action to avoid the consequences of the threat. She did not do this. Instead she chose to give false evidence. In my opinion the learned Magistrate was correct in rejecting the defence of duress and finding her guilty of this offence. I would add that her claim of the receipt of an anonymous document containing a threat was improbable.

34The evidence given by the appellant before the ICAC and before the learned magistrate was rambling, unconvincing and unreliable. The submissions she made both to the learned magistrate and to me were equally unconvincing. I do not accept her as a witness of truth. I do not accept the validity of any of her submissions

Conclusion

35I find the offences proved.

		24 December 2013",2013-12-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2762907,Brown v R [2013] NSWCCA 309,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J. 

2JOHNSON J : I agree with Latham J. 

3LATHAM J : The applicant, James Leon Brown, seeks an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him after a plea of guilty to robbery in company with the infliction of grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

4Judge Berman SC imposed a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months on 4 March 2010. The applicant filed a notice of intention to appeal on 18 March 2010 and an application for legal aid on 28 July 2010. On 7 December 2010 the application was refused on the basis that the Legal Aid Commission considered the appeal did not have reasonable prospects of success.

5The applicant's file was reactivated by Legal Aid pursuant to the review of cases initiated by the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 ; 144 CLR 120.

6This is yet another application which asserts the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing and the attribution of determinative significance to the standard non-parole period, contrary to Muldrock, in addition to a ground alleging error in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. For reasons which I have expressed elsewhere (see Bou-Antoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 305), it is difficult to comprehend why an extension of time ought be granted in circumstances where the latter ground was always available, yet considered lacking in merit when the applicant previously sought to appeal.

7The offence was committed by the applicant in company with a co-offender. On 24 November 2008 the offenders attacked a 36-year-old male who was walking in his local neighbourhood. The judge noted the fact that earlier that evening, the applicant and his co-offender had both been drinking. The applicant had also ingested Xanax. The applicant and his co-offender decided to obtain money for the purpose of purchasing heroin by robbing someone.

8The offence was described by his Honour in the following terms :-

The victim .. first saw the two men on the other side of the road. He was later pushed from behind, he fell forward and landed on his chest in a doorway. He tried to look around but was hit to his left eye. One of the two men, it does not matter who, grabbed his neck and pushed his face into the ground. His jacket was pulled over his head so he could not see anything. He was thus in a rather helpless position. Despite that he was kicked a number of times. One of the men made their intentions clear when he said ""I want your wallet"". Very sensibly [the victim] handed it over. It contained a number of things to which he was entitled, credit cards, personal papers, some money, a drivers licence and a gold souvenir coin.
The offenders were not satisfied however. They wanted his PIN number so that they could withdraw money from his bank account. He refused. The offenders responded by pulling him backwards and forwards and yelling ""give us the PIN number or I will kill you"". At this stage [the victim], hoping to minimise his loss, gave the offenders an incorrect number. Unfortunately for him the offenders had other ideas. The [co-offender] stayed with the victim while [the applicant] left the vicinity. Bank records show that on a number of occasions this [applicant] attempted to get the money out of [the victim's] bank account.
The attack upon [the victim] had woken someone nearby from her sleep. In fact what woke her was [the victim] crying out in pain. She looked out and saw [the victim] curled up in a foetal position on the ground being punched and kicked. She thus saw [the victim] in a helpless position. She arranged for the police to be called. In the meantime [the co-offender] made further demands on [the victim]. While [the applicant] was off trying to access [the victim's] bank account [the co-offender] asked for [the victim's] watch, and .... demanded that [the victim] hand over his wedding ring. He was also required to hand over his mobile phone.
At this stage [the applicant] returned, telling [the co-offender] that [the victim] had given the wrong PIN number. The offenders had not given up however. They responded by pulling his jacket over his head once more so that again he couldn't see anything. They picked him up off the ground and began dragging him before they pushed him in the back so he fell forward and hit the ground facedown. Once more they threatened to kill him saying ""give us the right number or I will kill you"". By now [the victim] had had enough so he gave them the correct PIN number. This time [the co-offender] left to access the bank account leaving [the applicant] behind. The [applicant] was not satisfied with the violence he had already inflicted, instead he kicked him again and held him down with his foot on his neck, in effect holding [the victim] captive for 10 minutes. The eyewitness said that at this stage every time [the victim] tried to get up the man, who we now know was [the applicant], would kick him. Fortunately police arrived preventing any further harm being caused to [the victim] although he had already suffered significant harm indeed.

9The judge went on to record the fact that the victim remained in hospital for three days, suffering a fractured collarbone, fractured cheekbone and significant bruising to his body. The victim suffered financially, because of his absence from work and his resumption on light duties, in addition to physical and emotional suffering.

10The judge noted the existence of the standard non-parole period and the fact that it was not of direct application because of the plea of guilty. His Honour observed that it remained as a guidepost to the sentence. That was the sum total of the references to the standard non-parole period within the remarks on sentence. 

11His Honour found that the offence was ""significantly above the middle of the range"" of objective gravity. His Honour observed that there ought be ""a substantial component of general deterrence"". Next, the judge referred to the submission of the applicant's legal representative that the applicant ought receive the same sentence as that imposed upon the co-offender and that the Crown did not submit to the contrary. A finding of special circumstances was made on the basis of the applicant's age, his youth and his need of supervision in the community. Finally, sentence was pronounced in identical terms to that imposed upon the applicant's co-offender.

12Whilst acknowledging that the judge correctly referred to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost and that ""the structure of the sentencing decision is not such that the judge commenced with an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and then turned to subjective factors"", the applicant submits that a conclusion that a two-stage approach to sentencing was in fact adopted, and that the standard non-parole period was given determinative significance, may be drawn from the combination of three factors : that the objective seriousness of the offence was classified by reference to the middle of the range, the ""neatness of the mathematics"" and the heaviness of the sentence.

13The first two factors have already been the subject of argument in this Court in Ngati v R [2013] NSWCCA 307. I repeat what I said in my judgment (with reference to the applicant's submissions in this case) at [18] - [20] (with the agreement of Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J) :-

With respect, this submission invites the Court to draw an inference that is not supported by the judge's comprehensive reasons. At its heart, it seeks support from matters external to the reasons and relies upon retroactive analysis. There is no indication anywhere in the remarks that the judge considered it mandatory to determine where the offence fell in the notional range. Considering the offence in accordance with Way does not, of itself, support that conclusion. There is nothing in Muldrock which prohibits a court from determining whether an offence falls within the mid range of objective gravity, rather the prohibition lies in adopting a two-stage approach to sentencing, that is by commencing with the standard non-parole period and oscillating around that figure, depending on the presence or absence of aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

The applicant's reference to the ""neatness of the mathematics"" derives from Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 150. However, the submission is, for my part, inscrutable. The applicant commences by noting that the notional starting point, prior to the application of the discount for the plea of guilty (25%), was [""a head sentence of 9 years and 4 months. Applying the statutory ratio .. would result in a non-parole period of 7 years - that is, the standard non-parole period.""] .......................................................................

There is nothing ""neat"" about these calculations. ........... It is of no moment that the judge did not specify [the notional starting point]. His reasons disclose an application of the discount for the plea of guilty, and a consideration of all the relevant factors, objective and subjective, before determining [that it was appropriate to impose the same sentence as was imposed upon the co-offender]. Given that the standard non-parole period is 7 years, that the offence was considered one falling [significantly] above the mid range and the non-parole period actually imposed was [4 years and 6 months], it is difficult to discern how the standard non parole period had ""determinative significance.""

14I reject the contention that the sentence imposed upon the applicant is heavy. Even if it were capable of that description, it does not of itself or in combination with other features of the sentencing exercise demonstrate Muldrock error.

15The applicant recognises that the finding of objective seriousness ought not be interfered with unless the judge erred in a House v The King sense (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499). The applicant submits however that the judge's discretion miscarried because of a mischaracterisation of ""the extent of the injuries suffered, and/or having little or no regard for the low level of injuries suffered"". The extent of this mischaracterisation is apparently his Honour's description of the injuries as ""substantial"" when compared with other instances of this offence resulting in the infliction of more serious injuries.

16The applicant also acknowledges that the gravity of the offence falls to be determined by reference to the length of time over which the offence occurred, the callousness of the violence inflicted, and the threats that were made to the victim in addition to the use of violence. It is then submitted that because the injuries occasioned to the victim were ""towards the lower end of the scale of grievous bodily harm"" that the judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence as significantly above the middle of the range was not open to him. The applicant then goes on to compare the instant offence with other cases of robbery in company causing grievous bodily harm.

17In my view, there is no useful purpose to be served by comparing the extent of the injuries inflicted in other cases with the instant case, by reference to findings with respect to the objective gravity of those other offences. The assessment is an evaluative one, which takes account of a variety of objective features (which the applicant himself recognises). The applicant's undue emphasis upon one of several factors seeks to isolate that factor as the critical one in the assessment of objective gravity. For my part, fractures to the collarbone, cheekbone and bruising of the body warrant the description ""substantial"".

18There is no merit in either ground of this application. No substantial injustice is occasioned to the applicant by a refusal to intervene : Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247. I propose that an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal be refused.

		09 December 2013",2013-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762911,Ramea v R [2013] NSWCCA 310,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J. 

2JOHNSON J : I agree with Latham J.

3LATHAM J : The applicant, Victor Ramea, seeks an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal a sentence imposed upon him by Conlon SC DCJ, following a plea of guilty to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 (1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

4The applicant was sentenced on 17 July 2009 to a non-parole period of 6 years with a balance of term of 3 years.

5There has been no previous notice of intention to appeal in respect of this matter. Putting to one side the ground asserting Muldrock error (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 ; 244 CLR 120), there is no explanation for the delay of four years with respect to five further grounds of appeal now pressed on the application. The applicant claims error in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence, error in finding that the offence was committed in company, error in treating the applicant's record of prior convictions as an aggravating factor, error in failing to give proper weight to the applicant's subjective case and manifest excess. 

6Consistent with the approach adopted by this Court in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247, the merit of the applicant's grounds of appeal ought be assessed in a relatively summary fashion in order to determine whether a failure to intervene gives rise to a substantial injustice to the applicant.

The Offence

7The applicant was sentenced on the basis of agreed facts. They recorded that at about 6 am on 18 October 2008, the applicant and two unidentified males hailed a taxi driven by the victim near Anzac Parade. The applicant sat in the front passenger seat and asked the victim to take them to Malabar Road. The applicant directed the victim to Rossiter Avenue Maroubra and told him to stop behind a parked vehicle.

8The victim saw that the applicant was holding a glass in his left hand. The applicant swung his hand at the face of the victim, smashing the glass on the victim's face. The applicant then struck the victim two or three times to the face whilst the victim attempted to protect his face with his hands.

9The applicant then got out of the car and walked to the driver's side of the taxi. The victim attempted to leave the car but was pushed back into the car by the applicant, who hit him a further four times to the head. The taxi rolled forward and the applicant ran after the taxi, continuing to hit the victim with his hand. The victim stopped the taxi and the applicant and the other two males ran away.

10The victim presented at the Prince of Wales Hospital with multiple facial wounds and arterial bleeding from lacerations adjacent to and underneath his right eye. The wounds were cleaned and repaired under local anaesthesia with 24 sutures.

11The applicant was arrested on 12 November 2008, participated in a record of interview and made admissions as to his involvement in the offence. He told police that he had been drinking and taking drugs but he remembered hitting the victim with a glass up to 4 times ""probably"" on the face. The applicant said that he had no money for the taxi and thought that attacking the victim was his only option.

Ground 1 : Muldrock Error

12The applicant submits that the judge adopted a two-stage approach to sentencing and gave determinative weight to the standard non-parole period.

13In particular, the applicant relies upon the following passage from the judge's remarks on sentence :-

There is a standard non-parole period of seven years imprisonment in respect of this offence. The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period appropriate for conduct within the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such an offence. Standard non-parole periods strictly apply only to offences upon conviction after trial. Although there has been a plea of guilty in the present case the standard non-parole period remains a reference point for the assessment of the appropriate sentence. As Howie J stated in R v Knight ; R v Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283 at 47 :

Even after a plea of guilty there must be an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offence regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation.

14The applicant does not take issue with any part of these remarks save for the reference to Knight and Biuvanua. At paragraph 21 of the decision in Muldrock, the High Court refers to a submission by the Crown that the approach in Knight (amongst other cases) evidences ""a 'more categorical' two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders"". It is thus submitted that his Honour's approach to sentence was significantly informed by a now discredited view of the role of the standard non-parole period.

15The full context of the passage cited from Howie J's judgment in Knight is :-

47 In my opinion it is clear that the Judge failed to give sufficient weight to the standard non-parole period even though it provided only a guidepost or indicator of the appropriate sentence. Even after a plea of guilty there must be an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offence regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation. When the objective criminality is above midrange then, of course, the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence becomes of more significance. 
48 It also seems clear in my view that the Judge allowed Ms Knight's subjective factors to distract her from imposing an appropriate punishment for her offending, given its very grave seriousness.

16The complaint by the Crown, which was upheld in Knight, was that the offender's subjective circumstances, described by the primary judge as ""peculiar circumstances"", were given undue prominence at the expense of the objective gravity of the offence. It is in that light that the italicised passage above ought be construed. I do not understand Howie J to be suggesting that mitigating factors play no part in the determination of an appropriate sentence for a standard non-parole period offence. 

17There is nothing inherently objectionable, even post Muldrock, in the statement that there must be an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offence. In my view, that is saying no more than that the standard non-parole period operates as a benchmark. However, I accept that Knight suggests that significant weight attaches to the standard non-parole period, although I would not embrace the proposition that any reference to Knight automatically demonstrates that a judge has attached determinative significance to it. 

18The applicant goes further, however, and argues that a reading of the remarks on sentence as a whole supports the conclusion that the judge adopted a two-stage approach. It is submitted that the judge's treatment of the objective gravity of the offence, followed by a consideration of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the contents of the victim impact statement, leading to a determination by his Honour that the offence fell slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness, prior to any consideration of the applicant's subjective circumstances, demonstrates that the judge offended the approved approach to sentencing set out by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; 228 CLR 357 at [51].

19That passage from Markarian describes ""two tier"" sentencing :-

By two-tier sentencing, I mean the method of sentencing by which a judge first determines a sentence by reference to the ""objective circumstances"" of the case. This is the first tier of the process. The judge then increases or reduces this hypothetical sentence incrementally or decrementally by reference to other factors, usually, but not always, personal to the accused. This is the second tier. By instinctive synthesis, I mean the method of sentencing by which the judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case. Only at the end of the process does the judge determine the sentence.

20However, it is also relevant to bear in mind that :-

It is not useful to begin by asking a general question like was a ""staged sentencing process"" followed. That is not useful because the expression ""staged sentencing process"" may mean no more than that the reasoning adopted by the sentencer can be seen to have proceeded sequentially. Or it may mean only that some specific numerical or proportional allowance has been made by the sentencer in arriving at an ultimate sentence on some account such as assistance to authorities or a plea of guilty. Neither the conclusion that a sentencer has reasoned sequentially, nor the observation that a sentencer has quantified the allowance made, for example, on account of the offender's plea of guilty, or the offender's assistance to authorities, of itself, reveals error. Indeed provisions like s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) may require the sentencer, in some circumstances, to identify the amount by which a sentence has been reduced on some account.

Markarian at [24] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

21Markarian was not a standard non-parole period case. There is nothing in that decision which reduces the significance of legislative guideposts, such as the maximum penalty or a standard non-parole period, in the sentencing task. The plurality in Markarian at [30] and [31] recognised that careful attention ought be paid to legislative yardsticks. McHugh J at [80] recognised that maximum penalties and prescribed non-parole periods guide the judicial instinct. The vice identified in Markarian was determining a sentence referable to an offence, and then engaging in ""arithmetical deduction"" from that sentence for mitigating and/or subjective factors. The plurality also acknowledged at [39] :-

that is not to say that in a simple case, in which, for example, the circumstances of the crime have to be weighed against one or a small number of other important matters, indulgence in arithmetical deduction by the sentencing judges should be absolutely forbidden.

22In Muldrock, the High Court deprecated an approach to sentencing for offences carrying a standard non-parole period that gave primary or determinative significance to the opening words of s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely, ""when determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence"" [26]. I note in passing that it has become common in this Court to refer to this aspect of Muldrock in a short-hand fashion, that is, by way of a submission that it is an error to give primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole period. However, the High Court was referring to an approach to the construction of s 54B(2) and was at pains to highlight the necessity of reading that provision in combination with s 54B(3) and s 21A. 

23It is theoretically possible that a standard non-parole period ultimately assumes primary significance in a sentencing exercise where little or no subjective case is advanced and where mitigating factors are absent. That much is implicitly recognised by the plurality in Markarian at [39]. Provided the determination of the appropriate sentence results from a synthesis of all relevant factors, there would be no Muldrock error, notwithstanding that the standard non-parole period exerted considerable influence on the outcome.

24Properly construed, the provisions call for a consideration of all relevant factors before arriving at an appropriate sentence, bearing in mind two legislative guideposts, the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period. The two-stage approach rejected in Muldrock was to ""[commence] with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period"" : [28].

25There is absolutely nothing in the judge's remarks in this case that meets that description. The argument that, in effect, every judge who deals with an assessment of the objective gravity of a given offence before a consideration of the offender's subjective case is ipso facto engaging in two-stage sentencing, gains no support from Muldrock and is at odds with the passage from Markarian set out at [20] above. Nothing in Muldrock prohibits an assessment of the objective gravity of an offence. On the contrary, it is explicitly recognised that the objective seriousness of an offence must be assessed wholly by reference to the nature of the offending [27]. Whether that is undertaken before or after dealing with the offender's subjective case is for the most part irrelevant to the detection of Muldrock error.

26The applicant's next submission is that the non-parole period ultimately imposed, namely 6 years, ""could be said to be just above the mid range"", allowing for the discount of 25% for the plea of guilty. The argument proceeds in this fashion ; applying the discount of 25% to the 7 years standard non-parole period results in a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months, therefore leading to the inference that the 6-year non-parole period actually imposed is ""just above"" the mid range. This submission ignores the application of the discount for the plea of guilty to the head sentence, after which a non-parole period is set that reflects the finding of special circumstances.

27In fact, the applicant suggests that ""his Honour must have started the sentence at 12 years"". Given the maximum penalty of 25 years for the offence, such a head sentence is consistent with both the judge's assessment of objective gravity and the influence of subjective factors. The application of the discount for the plea of guilty on this scenario resulted in the head sentence of 9 years. The non-parole period of 6 years represents 66% of the head sentence. In short, the mathematical analysis of the sentence pressed by the applicant does not compel the conclusion that ""the ultimate sentence was 'tethered' to the standard non-parole period.""

28In my view, there is no merit in this ground.

Grounds 2, 3 and 4 : Error in the Assessment of Objective Gravity and Aggravating Factors

29It is convenient to deal with these three grounds together.

30The encapsulation of the judge's findings with respect to the objective gravity of the offence appears as follows in the remarks on sentence :-

The facts in the present case speak for themselves. This is objectively a most serious offence. This was an unprovoked attack on a defenceless taxi driver whilst the offender was in company. The woundings did not occur as a result of a single act. The glass was repeatedly thrust into the victim's face. The offender clearly knew he had no money to pay for the cab and his considered response, albeit under the influence of alcohol and drugs, was a blitzkrieg attack on the taxi driver. Even though the taxi driver pleaded with the offender to stop and indeed tried to open the driver's door to escape, the offender came around to that side of the vehicle, pushed the driver back in and continued to rain blows on his face /head. The taxi was rolling forward at this stage as it was still in gear and the offender moved with it and continued to strike the victim. So quite apart from the wounding with the glass there was further gratuitous violence involved in this attack.

31His Honour then moved to a consideration of aggravating factors, namely, that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon, that the offender had a record of previous convictions, that the offence was committed whilst he was on conditional liberty and that the victim was vulnerable.

32His Honour found mitigating factors, namely, that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity, that the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation, that he had demonstrated remorse and that he had pleaded guilty.

33The applicant's counsel below submitted that the offence fell below the mid range of objective gravity because there was no planning and because the injuries were not at the ""top end of the scale"" such as those inflicted by a gun or a knife. His Honour answered this submission in these terms :-

Upon a consideration of all these matters my assessment is that this case falls slightly above the mid range of objective seriousness. I am not persuaded to the view that it should be considered otherwise because of the nature of the weapon or that the courts often see worse woundings.

34The applicant now seeks to re-agitate the submission advanced by the applicant's counsel below, namely, that because the result of the conduct is an important indicator of objective gravity for offences of this type (citing R v Mitchell ; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296 ; 177 A Crim R 94 at [27]), this offence did not warrant a finding of objective gravity above the mid range on the basis that the injuries caused to the victim were not as serious as might otherwise have been the case. 

35The nature of the injury is but one factor in the assessment of objective gravity. In any event, the assessment of objective gravity is an exercise of the sentencing discretion with which this Court will not lightly interfere. None of the applicant's submissions on this ground demonstrate a failure to take into account a relevant matter. 

36Allied to this ground is a submission that his Honour found that the offence was committed in company, that is, that his Honour took into consideration an irrelevant matter. This submission seeks to elevate an observation by the judge that the applicant was in the company of other persons to a finding in the nature of an aggravating circumstance. However, it is clear from the specific aggravating factors enumerated by his Honour in the course of his remarks on sentence that this submission is also lacking in merit.

37The reference to the applicant's record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor may be accepted as a technical error in the sense that, whilst s 21A(2)(d) provides that previous convictions aggravate an offence, they are not relevant to the objective gravity of the offending. The fact of prior convictions is not irrelevant. It disentitles the offender to a claim for leniency and it may demonstrate that the offending is not an uncharacteristic aberration : R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 ; 66 NSWLR 566. That was clearly the case for the applicant. 

38Of more relevance to the finding of objective gravity was the commission of the offence whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty, which was a by-product of his earlier offending. In those circumstances, I do not regard the reference to the applicant's previous criminal history as an aggravating factor as a material error in the sentencing exercise.

39The applicant has not persuaded me that the finding of above mid-range objective gravity was not open to the judge.

Ground 5 : Failure to Give Proper Weight to Subjective Circumstances

40This ground suffers from the same flawed reasoning as Ground 1. The submission is that the imposition of a non-parole period mathematically linked to the standard non-parole period establishes, without more, a failure to take sufficient account of the applicant's subjective case in that there was no downward adjustment to the sentence. Paradoxically, this argument invites the staged approach to sentencing that was criticised in Markarian and Muldrock. 

41I reject the premise upon which this argument is based.

Ground 6 : Manifest Excess

42This ground is based upon an examination of the Judicial Commission statistics and a comparison with other sentences imposed in relevant cases, such as Pillay v R [2006] NSWCCA 402, Speechly v R [2008] NSWCCA 204, Wilkins v R [2009] NSWCCA 222, Shaba v R [2011] NSWCCA 154, Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153, Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23, and R v Bugmy [2012] NSWCCA 223.

43The last three of these cases post-date Muldrock. These cases and the decisions in Aitchison v R [2012] NSWCCA 82, Mendes v R [2012] NSWCCA 103, and Carroll v R [2012] NSWCCA 118 are also relied upon.

44The Judicial Commission statistics for the period February 2008 to March 2013 disclose sentences of between 2 years and 16 years, with non-parole periods between one year and 10 years. The applicant's sentence is at the upper end of that range.

45In Pillay, there was no finding of manifest excess in relation to a sentence at first instance of 9 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 7 years. The Court intervened on the basis of a breach of the De Simoni principle and a failure to find special circumstances. The offender inflicted a single deep cut to the victim's hand. The substituted sentence of 5 years and 6 months non-parole with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months tends to defeat the applicant's argument on this ground.

46 Similarly, in Speechly the offender engaged in punching and kicking the victim together with others. A sentence of 10 years and 8 months, which included a non-parole period of 6 years, was varied to the extent that the balance of term was reduced to 3 years, primarily on parity grounds. There was no ground of manifest excess. Once again, this case does not support the applicant.

47In Wilkins, the offender struck the victim a number of times to the head with a hammer. The Court found that the offence did not warrant a finding of mid range objective gravity and accordingly reduced the sentence from 11 years 6 months, including a non-parole period of 7 years, to one of 8 years and 6 months, including a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. The Court found it unnecessary to determine whether the sentence was manifestly excessive. In any event, the substituted sentence is but 6 months less than that imposed upon the applicant.

48Shaba provides no assistance, given that the offender received a ""somewhat favourable"" sentence on account of the consequences to him of his assistance to authorities in respect of an unrelated matter. The offender inflicted a single knife wound to the left side of the victim. 

49In Aldous, the offender struck the victim once to the back of the head while holding a schooner glass. A sentence of 6 years, including a non-parole period of 3 years was upheld on the basis that the primary judge's assessment of the offence as slightly below mid range was open and that the sentence was a ""modest"" one.

50In Butler a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years was imposed at first instance and upheld by the Court. The offender struck the victim twice to the face whilst holding an implement that caused deep lacerations. There was no ground of manifest excess. The sentence is relevantly comparable.

51Lastly, Bugmy was a Crown appeal. Nothing can be gained by seeking to make comparisons with that case.

52Neither the statistics nor these cases support the applicant's contention that the sentence imposed upon him is manifestly excessive, that is, plainly unjust. 

53I propose that the extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal be refused.

		10 December 2013",2013-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762920,State of New South Wales v Scott [2013] NSWSC 1834,"Judgment

1This is the preliminary of hearing of proceedings which seek an order under s 9 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006. The Plaintiff seeks an interim detention order under s 18A and s 18C, alternatively, an interim supervision order under s 10A and s 10C with the conditions set out in schedule 8 to the summons. 

2The Plaintiff also seeks an order pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act for the appointment of two qualified psychiatrists to conduct psychiatric examinations of the Defendant and an order directing the Defendant to attend those examinations. 

3The Defendant opposes the orders that are sought today. Although he has no instructions to do so Mr Scragg, who appeared for the Defendant, anticipates that it may at least be necessary to make an interim supervision order. His principal position is, however, that on a final hearing the high standard of proof will not be made out. 

4On 20 April 2007 the Defendant was sentenced in respect of a serious sex offence, namely having sexual intercourse without consent, and at the time of the offence did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm on the victim. An offence of indecent assault was taken into account on a Form 1. The victim of these offences was a stranger, a female university student whom the Defendant approached in the street. The offences were committed on 27 May 2006. 

5He was sentenced by Judge Norrish in the District Court to an overall sentence of seven and a half years with a non-parole period of three years nine months commencing 30 June 2006. He has served the whole of his sentence and is due to be released on 29 December 2013. One reason for his serving the whole sentence is that for one reason or another he has not undertaken any courses for sex offenders whilst incarcerated. 

6The Defendant's conviction for these offences means that he is a sex offender within the meaning of s 4 of the Act. Since the Defendant remains in custody at the present time he is a supervised sex offender (s 5I), that enables the State to make the present application (s 5 H). 

7Section 7(4) of the Act provides that if following the preliminary hearing the Court is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended detention order or extended supervision order, the Court must make orders for examination of the Defendant by, inter alia, two qualified psychiatrists. 

8In addition, under those sections if the Defendant's current custody will conclude before these proceedings are determined, the Court may make an interim detention order or an interim supervision order for a period not exceeding 28 days. 

9The task of the Court at the preliminary hearing stage is not to predict the ultimate result. Rather the test is one similar to the prima facie test applied by magistrates in committal proceedings: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Haytar [2007] NSWCA 993 and State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 at [11].

10In the State of New South Wales v Brooks [2008] NSWSC 150 Fullerton J discussed the requirements when an interim order is sought and drew attention to the fact because two of the objects of the Act are to ensure the safety and protection of the community and to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders, it is appropriate to give weight to risk avoidance: see also Attorney General for New South Wales v Winters (2007) NSWSC 611 at [7]. 

11The test that must be satisfied was formally found in s 9(2) of the Act but is now to be found within the definition of a high risk offender in s 5B(2). Nevertheless the wording is identical and the learning which had developed in relation to s 9(2) is equally applicable under the amended form of the Act. 

12Section 5B provides that if, and only if, the offender is a high-risk sex offender can an extended detention order or extended supervision order be made. Section 5B(2) of the Act provides an offender is a high-risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 

13Section 5D provides the Supreme Court may on an application under this Act make an order for the detention of an offender if the offender is a high-risk sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 

14In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASCA 206; (2007) 176 A Crim R 110 Wheeler JA (with whom Le Miere AJA agreed) said at [63]:

In my view, an ""unacceptable risk"" in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention.

15In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; (2008)198 A Crim R 149 Steytler P and Buss JA said at [27]:

The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, for the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). As John Fogarty points out, albeit in a rather different context (Unacceptable risk - A return to basics (2006) 20 AJFL 249, 252), the advantage of the phrase 'unacceptable risk' is that 'it is calibrated to the nature and degree of the risk, so that it can be adapted to the particular case ... '. 

16In State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220 I said at [90]:

Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"". The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. That is also because s 17(3) provides for the further assessment that if the court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk a supervision order will not be adequate to meet the risk.

17What was contained in s 17(3) is now to be found in s 5D.

18The Defendant was born on 23 August 1983 and is now aged thirty-one years. He has a criminal record extending back to 1997 when he was aged fourteen. The offences are a mixture of property and drug related offences but there are also a number of offences involving violence. A number of charges were dealt with by way of dismissal under the Mental Health Act 2007. The material currently available shows that the Defendant suffers, and has suffered, from chronic schizophrenia and a severe intellectual disability. 

19There is a comprehensive risk assessment report dated 8 November 2013 from Megan Donaldson, a forensic psychologist. Ms Donaldson gave evidence on the application. She was an impressive witness who was on top of her material and upon whom I feel I could completely rely. The executive summary of her report relevantly says this: 

Mr Scott has an extensive history on (sic) non-sexual criminality and consistent failure to respond to community based supervision. 

Mr Scott suffers with Chronic Schizophrenia, predominantly negative symptoms; and an intellectual disability. These are responsivity factors or factors they may interfere with progress in regard to participation in treatment programs. ...Mr Scott has limited insight into his mental illness and intellectual disability needs. He has been appointed a Guardian as an alternative decision maker for Accommodation, Advocacy, Legal Services and Services. Mr Scott has recently demonstrated improved compliance with medication. Mr Scott has not completed any treatment specific to sexual offending. 

Mr Scott does not have realistic release plans. A referral has been made to ADHC for services and support. 

Based on actuarial assessment Mr Scott is considered a high risk of sexual re-offending relative to other men who have sexually offended. The mitigation of future risk would be temporarily enhanced by intensive community supervision and support.

20The reference to the appointment of a guardian is a reference to a determination by the Guardianship Tribunal to the effect set out in that executive summary on 28 June 2013. 

21Ms Donaldson carried out a series of tests and assessments on the Defendant. Two of those which concern the likelihood of sexual re-offending are the STATIC - 99R instrument and the Risk for Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP). The Defendant's total score on the STATIC - 99R was 6 which places him in the high-risk category relevant to other male offenders. The recidivism rate for those who score 6 is around 3.77 times higher than the recidivism rate expected for typical sex offenders, those scoring a 2 on the instrument. Around 92.4% of sexual offenders in the routine sample scored below the Defendant's score. 

22The STATIC - 99R instrument has limitations which Ms Donaldson acknowledges. 

23The RSVP was developed to assist in the identification and management of a comprehensive range of factors identified by the literature as related to sexual offending. It includes a total of two, both static and dynamic factors grouped into five domains; sexual violence history, psychological adjustment, mental disorder, social adjustment and manageability. These factors are not mutually exclusive. 

24It is not necessary to detail all of the subcategories of the five domains and how the Defendant fits into those categories and meets the criteria. It is sufficient to note that Ms Donaldson concludes that the Defendant presents with risk factors in all five of the domains covered by the RSVP. That, she said in her oral evidence, tends to support the assessment made on the basis of the STATIC 99R protocol. 

25The Defendant drew attention to an earlier assessment of the Defendant made on the STATIC - 99 protocol where he scored 5 which placed him in the moderate to high-risk range. The difference, Ms Donaldson explained, was that under the STATIC - 99R a revised version of the protocol, age is a more nuanced assessment. The general principle seems to be that risk of re-offending declines with age. At 31 the Defendant scores a 1 for his age with the result that he is placed in the high risk for offending. 

26Ms Donaldson says in paragraph 89 of her report having considered what she determined from both of the protocols:

Were Mr Scott to re-offend it could be relatively opportunistic evolving from an incidental encounter with a potential stranger victim or someone he knows. The victim would most likely be an adult female on her own; and may or may not occur in a private or public space during the day or night. His history of offending suggests he is at highest risk for sexual touching that may or may not escalate to penetration. The potential for escalation to more invasive penetrative sexual acts could not be discounted, should the offence be uninterrupted by external influence or the victim's resistance. He is likely to use physical violence, may threaten to harm or kill them if they raise alarm (e.g., scream) or resist; and, he may or may not equip himself with an improvised weapon. Mr Scott would likely be substance affected or not maintaining his medication at the time of offending. The offence would most likely be an isolated incident and he is likely to be easily identified and apprehended shortly after.

27Other matters of significance in the report are these. First, apart from schizophrenia he has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, substance abuse, mild mental retardation and personality disorder in regard to his level of anger on interpersonal conflicts. He may also have mild organic brain damage from previous use of petrol sniffing. His full scale IQ was in the extremely low range of intellectual functioning. 

28Secondly, the Defendant has limited insight into his mental health issues. In this regard it is worth quoting paragraph 30 of Ms Donaldon's report:

The results of Mr Scott's assessment of intellectual functioning suggests Mr Scott has difficulty comprehending information presented to him orally, thinking using words, and expressing his own thoughts and mental processes using words. He is likely to function on a concrete level and would struggle with abstract concepts such as navigating social and other relationships, and compliance with societal norms.

29Thirdly the Defendant has incurred 29 institutional misconducts since he was incarcerated in 2007. Eleven of these involve violence. 

30Fourthly, and not unrelated to the previous matter for present purposes, the Defendant has a poor history of cooperation with supervision. The index offence, it may be noted, was committed whilst he was serving the balance of parole for an earlier offence. I accept, however, that most breaches of conditional liberty occurred whilst the Defendant was a juvenile. 

31Fifthly, as was mentioned earlier, the Defendant has not undertaken any course in gaol relating to his sexual offending. Indeed there is evidence on at least one occasion on 10 May, 2011 where he declined to participate in the CUBIT course because he said:

I have too many gaol charges and I can do the rest of my time because I will be getting released from custody and too many other gaol issues, like gaol charges and that."" 

32I note however that a month later on 19 June 2011 he said:

I would like to meet with probation and parole officer to let them know I may do that course to try and get put back on probation and parole and to talk to him or her and I will for sure do the course.

33It appears that shortly after that time mental health issues intervened and orders were made under the Mental Health Act 2007 which may have prevented that from happening. Mr Scragg submitted that the main reason the Defendant has not undertake the courses is that there were none he was eligible for because of his intellectual disability. Ms Donaldson confirmed in her oral evidence that that was so. She noted in that regard - the second sentence at paragraph 94 of her report should read:

There are currently no readiness programs available for sexual offenders with an intellectual disability in custody. 

34I can accept that it is unfair to the Defendant that his inability to undertake appropriate courses whilst incarcerated should weigh against him on an application such as the present, but it is a factor which I must take into account bearing in mind the objects of the Act, the primary one being the safety and protection of the community, and noting that risk avoidance is a significant consideration on an interim application. 

35I have been provided also with a risk management report prepared by Community Corrections Officer, Ms Smith, and overseen by the manager of the extended supervision order team, Mr Ziggy Abedine. Both of those persons gave evidence before me. 

36I have read the risk management report. The evidence that each of them gave added little to what was contained in that report. A significant matter in that report is the heading on page 5 ""Accommodation"". That section relevantly says this:

To effectively manage Mr Scott's overall risk in the community it is essential that a provision be included in the risk management plan so that the offender can only reside at accommodation approved by his nominated departmental supervising officer. 

The offender has been appointed a guardian for a limited term as an alternative decision maker for accommodation, advocacy, legal services and services. A referral has been made for Mr Scott to receive support for ADHC and possibly reside in Community Justice Program (CJP) supported accommodation, however, the outcome of that referral is unknown at the time of writing this report. 

37I interpolate here that the outcome is still unknown and will not be determined until 5 February 2014. The report goes on to say this:

Should Mr Scott be made subject to an ESO, and his referral to CJP is unsuccessful, this Service would refer him to Nunyara, [a community offender support program known as COSP at Malabar]. This COSP centre is operated by Corrective Services NSW to provide transitional accommodation for offenders, generally for a period of up to approximately six months.

38Regrettably the Defendant has been ruled unsuitable to reside at the COSP facility at Nunyara. It is unfortunate that the application to the CJP will not be considered until 5 February. I was informed that the principal reason for that delay was because of initial reluctance on the part of the Defendant to agree to the process through ADHC with regard to accommodation. That, in turn, led to the application to the Guardianship Tribunal for the appointment of a guardian at least in respect of accommodation. That took time with the result that the procedures under ADHC were not initiated until September and that delayed the application to the CJP. 

39What is clear from all of that is that there is no suitable accommodation available to the Defendant at the present time. The matter was adjourned yesterday overnight to enable further inquiries to be made because of the concern I expressed about the accommodation for the Defendant in the face of the unsuitability for COSP and the later determination by the CJP. 

40I have been provided with an email forwarded from the NSW Trustee and Guardian that says this:

The Public Guardian's view is that a comprehensive support plan needs to be in place prior to Mr Scott's release from the facility to ensure that his release is a success and that he is not a significant risk to himself and others when released. In these circumstances the Public Guardian would normally expect that a person has a comprehensive needs assessment and that services are then in place which adequately address these needs prior to returning to the community.

41The email also noted that the manager of Statewide Disability Services advised the Public Guardian that the Defendant has been deemed eligible to receive ADHC services. Nevertheless the determination of the CJP will not take place until February. 

42The Defendant submits that at a final hearing the high onus of proof will not be discharged for the making of any order against the Defendant. The test of the present application is whether, if the evidence I have is proved, that evidence would justify the making of either type of order. 

43To make an extended detention order on a final basis involves an additional consideration set out in s 5D to which I have already referred. It involves in any event the balancing exercise that I referred to in Richardson (No 2) at [90]. 

44I cannot and I do not disregard the rehabilitation of the Defendant in that regard. Some of the evidence suggests that his rehabilitation can be achieved within the community. It may be that if he obtained suitable accommodation that rehabilitation can be implemented so that at a final hearing a continuing detention order would not need to be made. 

45There is nothing in the evidence I have, however, that suggests that no order of any sort would be made at a final hearing. The evidence I have if proved would justify the making of an extended supervision order. Such a finding by me enables an interim order of either kind to be made, Attorney General v Tillman at [98]. 

46Bearing in mind the factors that I have identified above - the mental illness, the intellectual difficulties, the poor insight and the fact that the Defendant has not done any courses towards rehabilitation in custody, coupled with the present lack of satisfactory living accommodation, I cannot be satisfied that an interim supervision order will provide sufficient protection to the public given what are said to be his risks of re-offending. 

47In those circumstances the orders that I will make are these:

(1) Pursuant to s 7(4) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 the Court appoints two qualified psychiatrists being Dr Allnutt and Dr O'Day to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the Defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by 31 January 2014. 

(2)The Defendant is directed to attend those examinations. 

(3)Pursuant to s 18A of the Act the Defendant is subject to an interim detention order from 29 December 2013 for a period of 28 days. 

(4)Pursuant to s 20 ss 1 of the Act a warrant is issued for the committal of the Defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the interim order referred to. 

(5)The proceedings are listened before the duty judge on 23 January 2014 to hear the State's application to extend the interim detention order and warrant referred to in orders 3 and 4 above. 

(6)I make an order pursuant to s 77 for the attendance of the Defendant, Mr Scott, at the Supreme Court to the hearing referred to in the orders 4 and 5 above. 

(7)The Plaintiff is directed to file and serve any further evidence by 18 February 2014. 

(8)The Plaintiff is to file and serve written submissions five days prior to the final hearing that is appointed. 

(9)The Defendant is to file and serve written submissions one day prior to the final hearing. 

(10)Liberty to apply to either party on one day's notice 

(11)Leave to approach the listing manager for a final hearing on the basis that the matter will take two to three days, and noting by the nature of the proceedings that there is some urgency and expedition required in that regard.

2762923,R v Osuamadi [2013] NSWSC 1831,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Osuamadi applies for bail. He was arrested on 4 April 2012 and charged with supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The offence is alleged to have been committed on 19 January 2012. Mr Osuamadi has been in custody on remand bail refused since the date of his arrest. His next trial is scheduled to commence at the Parramatta District Court on 1 September 2014. He will by then have been in custody awaiting trial for two years and five months.
	
	
	On 12 July 2012 Mr Osuamadi applied for bail. His application was heard and refused by Campbell J. In those circumstances this application attracts the operation of s 22A of the Bail Act 1978, which is relevantly in these terms:
	


""22A Power to refuse to hear bail application 

(1) A court is to refuse to entertain an application for bail by a person accused of an offence if an application by the person in relation to that bail has already been made and dealt with by the court, unless there are grounds for a further application for bail.

(1A) For the purposes of this section, the grounds for a further application for bail are:

(a) the person was not legally represented when the previous application was dealt with and the person now has legal representation, or

(b) information relevant to the grant of bail is to be presented in the application that was not presented to the court in the previous application, or

(c) circumstances relevant to the grant of bail have changed since the previous application was made.

(2)…""

Background


	
	Mr Osuamadi and his co-accused Chidi Amagwula were originally scheduled to be tried on 18 March 2013. The matter was not reached and was listed to recommence on 10 October 2013. That trial commenced but was then vacated on 14 October 2013. It was relisted to commence on 18 November 2013. The trial commenced on that day and proceeded for some time before Craigie DCJ and a jury until his Honour once again discharged the jury and vacated the hearing. It was shortly thereafter that the new date in September next year was allocated.
	
	
	Mr Osuamadi had in the meantime lodged a further application for bail in this Court sometime during 2013. It came before the Court but was adjourned to a later date on each of 6 June 2013, 22 August 2013 and 23 September 2013. It finally came before me on 5 December 2013. I reserved my decision.
	
	
	It emerged during the course of the application before me that Mr Osuamadi gave evidence when the matter first came before Campbell J on 12 July 2012. His current solicitor, Mr Rumore, then represented him. It is an accepted and uncontroversial fact that Mr Osuamadi gave evidence before his Honour in which he admitted his physical involvement in the events that found the Crown case against him. The criminality of that involvement is, however, denied upon the basis that Mr Osuamadi was performing his role for and on behalf of the police either as an under cover operative or as an assistant to such a person. Mr Osuamadi's admission of involvement would appear to have been made in the face of what on one view is an otherwise overwhelming case against him. It is unnecessary for present purposes to descend into the detail of that assertion. It is sufficient to observe that evidence has been, or is anticipated will be, given by what I am led to understand is an informant or undercover operative from the local Nigerian community identified only by the pseudonym ""Ozone"" that places Mr Osuamadi directly in the mix of events that include the supply of the drugs concerned. Other surveillance and intercepted conversations are apparently to a like effect.
	
	
	Mr Rumore explained to Campbell J on 12 July 2012 what Mr Osuamadi's defence would be. He explained it as follows:
	


""It will be a defence that he was working in conjunction with the undercover operative as his engaged further operative and, perhaps, without the official sanction of the police. It is an extraordinary case and, as I said, the only person I can get the evidence from is him.""


	
	That is precisely what Mr Rumore proceeded to do. Mr Osuamadi gave this evidence:
	


""Q. Can you briefly tell us how the organisation of the control operation that Ozone was involved in with the police came to involve you?

A. Ozone told me that the police would want him and me to work together undercover on some crimes about drugs in our community. He said to me that he would let the police know that I am helping him undercover. I said to him: You know what that means, I am tiled man, I am chief, I don't want to involve myself with this sort of thing. He said: You will be protected. I asked him and he said: I will contact the police. He said: You can do it. On the police, I requested when we go for the operation. So I said to him that…

Q. Just stopping you there, did you understand that you would be meeting with the police on the day of the controlled operation?

A. That is correct, I requested that.

Q. Who nominated the venue for the exchange of the prohibited drug for the cash sum of $110,000, who negotiated or suggested that place as a venue?

A. I suggested it. I said that I want a place that is in the broad daylight and I want it to be a normal place, so I need to see the police with camera and videos as evidence.

Q. Stopping there, did you stipulate that you wanted to see the police and you wanted to be convinced that what was happening was being recorded?

A. I did. He assured me that when I come the police have guaranteed him that I will see people with camera taking photo and video.

…

Q. What, if anything, were you promised or offered to participate in this way to introduce as a tribal chief somebody from your Nigerian community to the undercover operative Ozone, what were you offered?

A. Ozone told me that the police would pay me and him $50,000 so my share was $25,000 and he would have $25,000 as well. I said to him: It is not about the money, it is about exposing the evils in the community. I said: I have children and these drugs will end up in the hands of people. My conscience would not let me not to expose people who deal in drugs. So my own part in return, my reward, he said that they will pay me $25,000 and him $25,000.

Q. As to your belief in the authenticity of what you were being told by Ozone, you knew he had been convicted and sentenced to a lengthy period of imprisonment for drug dealing, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you knew, did you, that his sentence was substantially curtailed or shortened and he was released from prison early because of what he told you was his then association with the police?

A. That is correct. He told me exactly that, if he is to undercover, if I am to help him undercover this, that the police would come and he could spend time with his wife and son.

…

Q. Did you raise with the police in the course of the electronically recorded interview or any statement to the police following upon your arrest what your role was, as you understood it to be from your discussions with Ozone in the controlled police operation, did you tell them about that?

A. No, because I was not given the opportunity. The police said they would kill me unless I returned the whole money. So I was scared for my life. So when he said that I was very very scared and then I just could not hold it any longer and I said to him: Is it a fact now that you mislead me. I work for you and the police and they are saying that unless I return the whole amount of money they won't give me the amount of reward they promised me, so I was scared for my life.""


	
	I consider that Mr Rumore's description of the matter as ""an extraordinary case"" does no disservice to the truth. If anything, Mr Rumore could be accused of understating the curious and intriguing nature of the circumstances from which it is hoped Mr Osuamadi's successful defence of the case against him will ultimately emerge. I hasten to add that Mr Osuamadi did not give evidence before me, and I am wholly without any observational or first hand material that would permit me to arrive at an informed view of the truth of the evidence that he gave before Campbell J.
	
	
	The Crown disputes this version of events in its entirety. In particular, the Crown disputes that Mr Osuamadi was recruited officially or in any other way to assist in the operation, and insists on the contrary that he was its target.
	
	
	I raise these matters in the context of an assessment of the strength of the Crown case. In essence Mr Osuamadi concedes that, but for this defence, the success of which relies upon the prospect that the jury will necessarily accept his version of events, he faces the highly likely prospect of a finding of guilt and a conviction for the offence as charged. That is a significant and important matter to be considered by me in the event that I were otherwise satisfied that Mr Osuamadi had established that the ""circumstances relevant to the grant of bail have changed since the previous application was made."" It is to that question that I now turn.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Osuamadi put the case on two general bases. First, that the procedural history of the criminal proceedings since at least the decision by Campbell J to refuse bail is such that this further application for bail is both warranted and permissible. The time elapsed since then has been almost 17 months and still there has been no final disposition of the proceedings. There remain another 11 months before the trial will start again. That will by then have become the fourth scheduled date for the commencement of the trial. Those are said to constitute a sufficient change in circumstances for the purposes of s 22A of the Act.
	
	
	Secondly, by reason of circumstances that attended the decision by Craigie DCJ to discharge the jury in the trial as recently as 3 December 2013, there has arisen a prospect that Mr Osuamadi will not, or may not, be able to obtain a fair trial. That submission arises in the following circumstances.
	
	
	Mr Osuamadi was transported each day during his trial from Parklea Correctional Centre to the Parramatta District Court in the morning and returned each afternoon. It was his habit to take with him notes and legal papers relevant to his trial. These were sometimes the product of his own efforts in court and at other times in his cell where he recorded events and formulated his thoughts and instructions in writing for the benefit of both himself and his legal team. He also carried other legal material, including the transcripts of the trial and such things as transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations and (I assume) copies of documents forming at least part of the served brief of evidence in his trial.
	
	
	It emerged on 29 November 2013 that Mr Osuamadi had somehow been denied access to much of this material. The circumstances in which that occurred are by no means clear. On the one hand Mr Osuamadi alleges that he was deprived of his legal papers by the unauthorised acts of the corrections officers who took papers from him on his way to court. Even though some of this material has been recovered, Mr Osuamadi contends that it has not all been recovered and that he is therefore severely disadvantaged. On the other hand the Crown concedes that Mr Osuamadi was in fact deprived of this material but that it has now all been returned to him. The Crown faintly suggests that Mr Osuamadi is the author of the so called problem and that he secreted the material somewhere in his cell so as to provide a foundation for what turned out to be a successful application to abort his trial. The correctness of that assertion does not in my view relevantly inform the present inquiry.
	
	
	It is not possible in a satisfactory or principled way to determine where the truth lies between these competing versions of what occurred. It is an issue that generated significant concern and evidentiary attention in the application before me. That attention was, however, in my opinion wholly disproportionate to its significance in the question of whether or not Mr Osuamadi has satisfied s 22A of the Act. That is for at least two reasons. First, the issue of delay seems to me to be far more significant and alone sufficient to amount to changed circumstances permitting the bringing of this application. Secondly, there does not appear to be any suggestion that the still missing papers have now all been lost irretrievably so that a fair trial at any time in the future cannot ever be achieved. If that were the contention it would be relevant to an application of a different kind, and not to a further application seeking bail. In expressing that view I should not wish to be taken to be downplaying or discounting the seriousness of the allegations that Mr Osuamadi has made, whatever the truth concerning them might in due course turn out to be. Whether the disadvantages that Mr Osuamadi asserts he has suffered ultimately provoke an application with respect to the further conduct of the proceedings remains to be seen.
	
	
	As I have indicated, the more significant issues for my purposes are the delay that has so far seen Mr Osuamadi incarcerated for a considerable period without a concluded trial, and the delays that he still faces. These past and prospective delays are in my view sufficient to warrant the bringing of this application. They are changed circumstances since Campbell J refused bail in July last year.
	


Disposition


	
	In my opinion the Crown case is very strong. The facts establishing Mr Osuamadi's criminal involvement are undisputed apart from the defence that he has foreshadowed. The physical and technical surveillance material suggests Mr Osuamadi's direct involvement in the supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine with a purity of 75.5 percent. The Crown case is said to be based upon investigations of West African Organised Crime syndicates in this country over some time. Mr Osuamadi has allegedly been identified as a prominent member of such a criminal organisation. It goes without saying that I cannot be satisfied to the criminal standard of the matters upon which the Crown relies in opposing this application. That is an unfortunate and regrettable frailty attending almost every decision to grant or to refuse bail.
	
	
	Based purely upon my current limited understanding of Mr Osuamadi's proposed defence, I consider that it seems inherently improbable for a number of possibly obvious reasons. It is unnecessary for present purposes to elaborate on all of those. However, it must inevitably be the case that Mr Osuamadi will have to give evidence in or to the same effect as that which he gave before Campbell J. From the admittedly unsatisfactory distance that I have viewed that evidence, it seems to me to be inherently improbable if not completely incredible. Without making any final or binding determination of that issue, it is sufficient for me to note that it would not displace my opinion, already expressed, about the strength of the Crown case.
	
	
	There is a statutory presumption against bail in the present case. Section 8A of the Act applies. Section 8A(2) provides that ""[A] person accused of an offence to which this section applies is not to be granted bail unless the person satisfies the court that bail should not be refused.""
	
	
	The Crown contends that the circumstances in which Mr Osuamadi was detected have created the potential for him improperly to approach witnesses. He has a limited history of violence. He is separated from his wife although he still sees his children regularly. He has a Nigerian passport. The Crown is fearful from material in their possession that he also has access to counterfeit passports that could facilitate his undetected departure from Australia under an assumed name. He has used several aliases in the past. There is an unusually strong incentive for someone in Mr Osuamadi's position to leave the jurisdiction and he has both the connections here and elsewhere to facilitate it. I am significantly influenced by my anticipation that a guilty verdict is highly likely.
	
	
	Having regard to the offence charged, the apparent strength of the Crown case, and other (as yet untested) factors adverted to by Detective Ferfiris in his letter dated 29 November 2013 setting out his reasons for opposing bail, I am not satisfied that Mr Osuamadi has established sufficient reasons why bail should not be refused.

		08 February 2016",2013-12-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762928,Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: The applicant, Mr Tony Golossian, was found guilty by a jury on 15 December 2010 of 24 sexual offences following a trial lasting 50 days. He was sentenced by Hock DCJ to an aggregate sentence of 20 years dating from 4 November 2010, with a non-parole period of 15 years also dating from 4 November 2010. 

2The applicant seeks an extension of time to appeal his conviction on four grounds. Grounds 1 and 2 complain that the verdicts of guilty in relation to the counts relating to each of the two complainants (""MM"" and ""MP"") were unreasonable and/or cannot be supported by the evidence. Ground 3 is narrow, and challenges a refusal by the trial judge, late in the trial, to recall MM to give evidence about messages left on the answering machine of the applicant's co-accused, (""AP""). Ground 4 complains that the trial judge's summing up was unfair and unbalanced. 

3Leave is required for all aspects of the proposed appeal. The application was made late, its lateness was only partially explained, and in addition to the ordinary prejudice to the community and the administration of justice generally, it presents a particular prejudice, because it caused a bifurcation of the criminal appellate process. The third co-accused, (""FP""), convicted by the same jury on the same evidence, also appealed against conviction (as well as her sentence) and the grounds of her appeal overlapped with the applicant's. 

4For the reasons which follow, I propose that leave be refused in relation to all four grounds. I deal with each ground in turn, as well as giving my reasons for joining in the Court's order made on the second day of the hearing refusing leave in relation to a proposed fifth ground. But, given the nature of Grounds 1, 2 and 4, I must start with an overview of the case. 

Overview of facts, parties and principal witnesses

5Early in her summing up to the jury, the trial judge said:

""There has been evidence about ""mayia"" or black magic ... It is irrelevant whether you have such a belief, whether it is your personal belief, or whether you regard such a belief as nonsense or silly. What is important is the evidence from the witnesses about what they told you about their beliefs at the relevant time of the issues concerned with this trial and of course whether you accept what they told you about their belief or beliefs. ... Similarly ... you have evidence of sexual behaviour which perhaps is outside the realm of many people in the community. As I told you at the time of this evidence this is a criminal court concerned with the criminal law. It may well be that some or all of you feel that you would not have acted as [MM] or [MP] did. Or that some or all of you disapprove in [MM's] behaviour in engaging what has been described as ""the threesome"". Or you might disapprove of [AP's] behaviour in having undisputed sexual intercourse with [MM] when he was married to [FP]. You may not regard that behaviour as morally acceptable but the cases are not concerned with issues of morality, you are concerned with criminal offences only and all moral judgments must be put to one side. All people are entitled to be treated equally before the law no matter what their cultural background and beliefs are or their sexual behaviour is.""

6As that passage reveals, the facts giving rise to the convictions are highly unusual, something which is of considerable importance in relation to all of the proposed grounds of appeal. 

7The applicant, who was 63 when tried, was known as a ""holy man"" with power to break black magic and curses, known in the Greek community as ""mayia"". He had a ""prayer room"" at the back of his home at Dulwich Hill, and would regularly conduct prayer sessions there and elsewhere. He claimed to be able to speak with angels. 

8His co-accused AP and FP were husband and wife. They, and the complainants MM and MP, were of Greek heritage. All had strong religious beliefs. MM and MP claimed to be in fear of black magic, or mayia. The applicant and AP were charged with sexual assaults committed upon MM between 2001 and 2005, and all three co-accused were charged with sexual assaults committed upon MP in 2008. Both MM and MP claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the applicant in a context when the applicant was praying over them in order to remove a curse. 

9Between 2001 and 2003, MM's boyfriend was SP, who was a childhood friend of AP. SP introduced MM to AP and FP and, later, to the applicant. SP gave evidence that he was of the Greek Orthodox faith, but also believed in curses and the evil eye. The Crown case was that the applicant and AP had preyed upon MM's belief in black magic or mayia, in order to sexually assault her. 

10The complainant MP's husband GK was FP's brother. There was evidence that when GK was around 12 years old and his sister FP was around 6, he had sexually assaulted her. In the case of MP, the Crown case was that the applicant, AP and FP had preyed upon the beliefs of MP and GK in order to sexually assault MP. In addition, the applicant, AP and FP were charged with obtaining $50,000 by false pretence, namely by stating that the payment would obviate the need for GK to leave his family and become a monk. All three were acquitted by direction on this charge. 

Application for extension of time - factual background

11This is not an appeal, and should not be resolved as if it were. It is an application for a substantial extension of time within which to appeal from the applicant's conviction, which was opposed by the Crown principally on the basis that cause to do so had not been demonstrated. It follows that it is necessary to address the procedural history. 

12Each of the three people convicted by the jury on 15 December 2010 (that is, the applicant, FP and AP) filed Notices of Intention to Appeal from their convictions. During the second half of 2011, two days (31 January and 1 February 2012) were allocated for the hearing of all three appeals. 

13All three appeals were listed for directions before the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 10 November 2011. The Registrar was told by the solicitor then appearing for the applicant that a ""negative merit advice"" had been provided by senior counsel, with the result that there would not be a grant of Legal Aid. He appears also to have said that he had applied to extend the Notice of Intention to Appeal to permit the applicant to decide what he would do; either expressly or implicitly he advised that his firm would not be acting for the applicant. Counsel appearing for FP appears to have submitted that her appeal had been filed months earlier, that the hearing date should be retained and that his client would be disadvantaged if it were changed. The solicitor for the Crown observed that there was no application to vacate the hearing date for FP, that that date should be preserved, and asked that the applicant's proceeding be listed for callover on 1 December 2011. 

14On 1 December 2011, the applicant's proceeding was adjourned for mention to 16 February 2012, and on that date the proceeding was stood out of the list because the Notice of Intention to Appeal had expired without the filing of a Notice of Appeal. The applicant's original Notice of Intention to Appeal had been filed on 6 May 2011. In the ordinary course it would have expired six months later, but an application to extend its life was filed on 4 November 2011, and the Registrar granted an extension until 30 January 2012. By 16 February 2012, a grant of leave extending the time within which to commence an appeal was required. FP's appeal had been heard and judgment was reserved. That judgment was delivered on 23 August 2012: FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182. 

15In early June 2012, the applicant's current lawyers were retained to explore his prospects of appeal. They had received the trial judge's summing up on 22 March, and received the file from the applicant's former solicitors on or about 15 June. Quite promptly, Mr Conditsis identified as a potential ground of appeal, the alleged wrongful exclusion from evidence of an audio tape (which had been VD 14) whose transcript became VD 17 (this is relevant to proposed Ground 3). However, there was no communication with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions advising even of the potential for an application for leave to appeal prior to a letter dated 21 December 2012. 

16Mr Conditsis said that three things caused the delay until 21 December 2012. The first was that there was delay in paying his costs. The second was that he needed, on two occasions, to visit the applicant who was being held at Goulburn Correctional Facility, and the third was the volume of material to be digested. 

17The evidence does not disclose what time of the day on Friday 21 December 2012 Mr Conditsis' letter was sent to the ""Managing Lawyer"" at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (less unhelpfully, it was copied to the detective who had been in charge of the investigation). It seems likely that it was sent in the morning, because the letter concluded with a Christmas message and advice that Mr Conditsis' office would close from 12pm Friday 21 December 2012 and reopen on Monday 7 January 2013. 

18No Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed until 31 May 2013. In the intervening five months there was correspondence directed to obtaining a copy of the audio tape. That tape was never produced. But in any event, by letter dated 1 February 2013 Mr Conditsis unequivocally maintained that: 

""One of the grounds of appeal will inter alia, assert that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow [MM] to give evidence about the tape before the jury and in refusing to admit the tape into evidence."" 

19What follows from the foregoing is this. First, from the moment Mr Conditsis was retained it was necessary for the time within which to appeal to be extended; he was (or at least ought to have been) aware of this. 

20Secondly, when in June 2012 one ground of potential appeal had been identified by Mr Conditsis, judgment in FP's appeal was reserved, and it would have been open for application to be made for the same bench to hear another appeal from conviction by the same jury on the same evidence, which had originally been the intention of the parties and the Court. There are obvious efficiencies in that course and, more importantly, it would avoid the possibility of inconsistent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, differently constituted, hearing appeals from the same trial, in accordance with the procedural directions initially put in place. As it is, six judges have each sat for two days hearing applications arising out of the same highly unusual facts. That said, there would have been difficulties with that course, and it might be expected that FP would oppose the determination of her appeal being delayed. 

21Thirdly, there is no evidence one way or the other as to whether the applicant accepted the advice of senior counsel as to the prospects of his appeal. Even if an applicant is without legal representation and has difficulties with written English, it is not unusual in this Court for affidavits to be sworn in support of an application for extension of time explaining the position prior to the current solicitor being retained. It is not necessary to draw an inference as to the applicant's state of mind in November and December 2011; it is sufficient to observe that the onus rests with him to establish, by way of evidence, that his is an appropriate case for the significant extension of time sought by him. 

Applicable legal principles for extension of time

22This Court is required to heed time limits which are, after all, imposed by the Legislature. There must be an end to litigation, even to a serious criminal prosecution. It is to be borne in mind that the sexual assaults of which the applicant was convicted took place between 7 and 12 years ago. Memories fade. One of the complainants, MP, who was recalled during the trial, has already endured the stress associated with FP's appeal. 

23Authority is not lacking. As was said in Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142 at [83] (Simpson J, Johnson J and Grove AJ agreeing): 

""Time limits are fixed by legislation for the making of applications (of any kind) for good reason. While it is relatively commonplace for this Court to permit a substantial degree of latitude in sentencing matters, there must be boundaries. The Court will, especially in cases of substantial delay, look for a satisfactory explanation for the failure to pursue a remedy at the appropriate time: see Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424."" 

24In Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 Johnson J said, with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and James J, at [38]-[39]: 

""There is a clear public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court against conviction and sentence. The time limit for the bringing of an appeal to this Court under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 reflects the principle of finality in litigation: R v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990 at 995-996; R v Gregory at [39]-[41]. There is provision for extension of time to appeal and this power should be exercised with the interests of justice in mind, given the usual consequences of conviction following trial on indictment. However, the longer time passes without an appeal being filed, the more solid ought be the expectation of the community, witnesses, victims and the families of victims that the criminal proceedings are over. This is a significant consideration to be taken into account on a leave application. Should an appeal against conviction succeed and a retrial is ordered, witnesses will be required to testify once again, with the further passage of time resulting from a delayed appeal having the potential to affect detrimentally the administration of justice. 

This Court has recently refused an extension of time to appeal against conviction for murder because of the absence of any satisfactory explanation for the delay and the lack of merit in the proposed grounds of appeal: McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174. When considering the interests of justice in relation to an application for leave to appeal, regard should be had to the interests of the Crown (representing the community) and the administration of justice generally, as well as the interests of the applicant for leave: R v Gregory at [41]; McCall v R at [6]."" 

25The applicant in Ngo had at least sworn an affidavit seeking to explain the delay, even though it was found to be ""entirely unconvincing"": at [85]. Here, the applicant swore no affidavit explaining his state of mind. He abandoned his appeal after receiving ""negative merit advice"" from senior counsel. The inference can readily be drawn, and should in the circumstances be drawn, that irrespective of whether the applicant agreed or disagreed with senior counsel's advice on prospects, he was aware that his inaction was causing him to lose his appeal as of right, and splitting proceedings in this Court which had been listed to be heard together. 

26In the context of a sentencing appeal, the Court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [8]. The position is worse in the case of an appeal against conviction where there is a prospect of a retrial, because of the availability of witnesses and the freshness of their recollections: Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; 205 A Crim 138 at [23]. The Australian legal system places a high value upon fair procedure and correct outcome, a point emphasised very recently by Basten JA (with the agreement of Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Price and Beech-Jones JJ) in Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383 at [47]. 

27This Court reviewed the authorities relating to extensions of time following the change in law identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, and in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [31]-[53]. It is sufficient to note the conclusion at [53], that where there had been a change in the law: 

""[A]ll relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result. This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time."" 

28In Alpha v R [2013] NSWCCA 292 at [1] and [15] this Court confirmed, if it was not already clear, that the same principles applied in all cases where an extension of time is required. 

29The delay is considerable, and contains three periods for which there is no satisfactory explanation. The first is that there is no explanation for the delay from late 2011 until June 2012, when the applicant's appeal was permitted to lapse. The second is that there was no explanation for the delay from June 2012 (when Mr Conditsis had identified a potential ground of appeal) until Christmas 2012 when he first advised of the possibility of an application for an out-of-time appeal. The third is from January 2013 until May 2013 when an application was filed (the communications concerning the audio tape VD 14 do not amount to a satisfactory explanation, for the letter of 1 February 2013 makes it plain that obtaining access to the exhibit was not necessary). 

30There were two discrete matters of prejudice occasioned by the applicant's unexplained, or unsatisfactorily explained, delay. One was that it is at least possible that the delay contributed to the inability to locate VD 14. (It is one thing to retain exhibits while an appeal, or a notice of intention to appeal, is on foot; it is another to do so when the time for any appeal has expired - it may be noted that VD 14 was not relevant to FP's appeal.) The second is that the applicant is to be taken knowingly to have caused the bifurcation of the criminal appeal process by separating his application from FP's appeal on the same evidence by the same jury. 

31In accordance with Sinkovich, Abdul and Alpha, even though the delay by the applicant is significant, and in large measure unsatisfactorily explained, it remains necessary to examine the merits of the proposed appeal. However, that is to be done in a more summary fashion than would be the case on the hearing of an appeal. If that were not so, the time limits imposed by the Legislature would become entirely otiose: Etchell at [24]. 

32All of that said, the trial occupied 50 days, the facts are highly unusual, and even in dealing with them as I propose to do more summarily than would be the case on an appeal, it will be necessary to address some questions of detail. In the reasons which follow, I have confined the description of the facts to what is sufficient to address the strength (or more accurately, absence of strength) of each of the proposed grounds. 

33It is convenient to adopt the following course, which follows the order of the trial, rather than the order of the proposed notice of appeal. First, I deal with proposed Ground 2, which relates to the convictions involving MP. MP was the first witness for the Crown, and her evidence was reviewed in FP's appeal. I then deal with proposed Ground 1, the convictions involving MM. I then address proposed Ground 4, the complaint about the primary judge's summing up. Finally, I deal with proposed Ground 3, which is much narrower: the application late in the trial to recall one of the complainants, and my reasons for refusing leave in respect of (the related) Ground 3A. 

Proposed Ground 2: Verdicts of guilty in relation to the MP counts were unreasonable and/or cannot be supported by the evidence

34The starting point is that MP and to a lesser extent her husband GK claimed to be in fear of black magic, which they described as ""the evil eye"". They regarded the applicant as a holy man who could communicate with angels. Likewise, the applicant and AP and FP all claimed to believe in the evil eye. The testimony of MP and GK does not make sense unless one accepts that their beliefs were sincerely held. 

35MP believed that a curse had been laid upon them, which, if not broken, would cause MP to die from cancer, GK to die in an accident, and their children to die. The applicant advised that there were ""mayias"" (or curses) in the front yard of GK's and MP's home, and objects were found there, one of which contained MP's hair and underwear, the other contained some small bones with fine writing on it. MP described the latter as ""like a voodoo doll of some sort"". MP said that the applicant told her that the only way to remove the curse was for him to do a prayer over her while she was naked. 

36There was some objective evidence supportive of their testimony. MP and GK gave evidence that on 29 March 2008, at 9.06pm, she received a text message:

""I am the red evil I want you to wait for me after 12 o'clock I will be inside your house I want you and your wife 2 be naked & stay in the bed.""

37The applicant told GK to change his phone so that it could receive pictures, which he did. GK received many text messages, including the following:

""Angel. I want u 2 listen 2me & not change what 4 say this is very important & whatever we ask u 2do u must say yes & not complain even with the evil spirit.don't say no just listen 2them & pray if u make them upset they will harm ur family specialy your daughter & fatherinlaw. They try 2 put the baby inside maria & make her sick by deseas & cancer & the baby will look like an animal & all the people will talk about her. I want 2tell u because she [sic]"" 

38The jury convicted the applicant of all seven primary counts in the indictment concerned with offences against MP. Those counts related to three prayer sessions conducted on 5 April, between 16-20 April and around 1 May 2008. In each case FP picked up the applicant and took him and MP to a rented room (the Marco Polo motel at Summer Hill for the first session, the Ashfield Motor Inn for the second and third). On each occasion FP was sent to buy food and drink, including orange juice. On each occasion MP was told to drink the orange juice after the applicant had prayed on it. She did so, and on each occasion, she said that she felt dizzy. MP gave evidence that on each occasion, she was sent to the bathroom, where she undressed, returned wearing a towel, and was sexually assaulted. There is little point reproducing the detail of this evidence once more; it has been described by RA Hulme J in FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [29]-[49]. 

39The applicant was charged with administering to MP an intoxicating substance (Zolpidem) with the intention of enabling him to commit a sexual assault (Crimes Act 1900, s 38(a)), and with committing assault (in two cases penile/vaginal intercourse, in one case oral intercourse). The applicant was also convicted on a count of conspiring with AP to enable AP to sexually assault MP. 

40The principal evidence in support of those convictions was that of the complainant MP. MP had made complaint to GK and to her friend HD immediately after the first prayer sessions. Following the third prayer session MP bought a recording device and recorded telephone calls made to her by AP. Those tapes were in evidence and included these words: 

""I am the red evil. We can't work with you in that way. We are the fire, we are the sickness, we are death. 

If you make any mistake...we will take part of your father health every time"".

41Telephone records tendered at the trial appear to establish that that call (transcribed as 7 minutes and 13 seconds) was made on AP's mobile phone on 30 May 2008 at 8.51pm. AP admitted to making the calls; he said he was acting at the request of GK who ""was sick and tired of his wife bossing him around and basically treating him like a woman in the house and he wanted to scare her into listening to him so he can wear the pants instead."" 

42MP gave evidence that she had never knowingly ingested Zolpidem. There was unchallenged chemical evidence that although Zolpidem is eliminated from the body in about 2.5 hours, it remains detectable in the hair. Unchallenged expert toxicology evidence from MP's hair confirmed that she had ingested Zolpidem in the period from January to May 2008 (the period in which all three prayer sessions occurred). At each of those prayer sessions, MP gave evidence that she had drunk orange juice and that she felt dizzy and heavy after doing so on each occasion. 

Applicant's submissions

43The focus of the applicant's submissions on Ground 2 was inconsistencies in the evidence of MP. Many of these were minor in the extreme. For example, it was said that ""MP was not able to satisfactorily explain why she did [not] heed the advice of the priest"" (her Greek Orthodox priest had advised that mayias and the evil eye was ""rubbish""). However MP gave an explanation, namely, that she believed in curses and was told by the applicant and AP and FP to disregard the priest's advice. Further, the trial was replete with witnesses who adhered to the Greek Orthodox religion but had strongly-held views about curses, and white and black magic. 

44Another example was that it was said that MP ""did not offer a strong denial"" to other evidence that during the first prayer session she had said that two other men had raped her. However MP's evidence, consistently, was that she could not remember saying those words, but did not deny it. This is consistent with the effects of Zolpidem (there was unchallenged evidence that Zolpidem caused memory loss). The written submissions advanced the possibility that MP had ""likely delusional beliefs"" and might have been prescribed a drug which included Zolpidem. But as in so many aspects of this trial, the jury was in a substantially superior position to observe MP and each of the accused. 

45The applicant and MP said they believed in curses, black magic and white magic. It was open to the jury to accept that those beliefs were genuinely held, notwithstanding MP's high degree of education and the various managerial positions she held with major banks. From that premise, it was not unreasonable for the jury to have accepted MP's evidence, the minor inconsistencies to which the applicant points notwithstanding. 

46Mr Conditsis was asked to identify his strongest points. He gave a deal of attention to the COPS record made on 2 June 2008 which referred to MP only being given apple juice, not orange juice at the prayer sessions. Of course, the COPS record does not purport to be a verbatim account of what MP said. That level of inconsequential detail is illustrative of much of the attack upon MP's evidence. 

47Mr Conditsis' submissions were, in substance, the submissions which would be put to a jury, in an attempt to reduce the credibility of the Crown case so as to establish a reasonable doubt. They resemble those advanced without success at trial. They failed to grapple with the different task which fell upon him in seeking to establish this ground of the proposed appeal. 

48This Court would be required, if hearing an appeal, to weigh the competing evidence and to make its own independent assessment as to the sufficiency and quality of that evidence: see SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [24], Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [465], BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48 at [31]. But the question would remain whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt ""which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt"": Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Hayne J with whom Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed). 

49Of course there were inconsistencies in the testimonial evidence of MP. But as McHugh J said in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 534, ""[i]t is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events"". Further, as Johnson J noted Tonari v R [2013] NSWCCA 232 at [192]: 

""victims of sexual assault do not necessarily respond in ways that accord with some mechanical or pre-determined view as to how a victim should respond."" 

50But this is not an appeal. In the course of a lengthy oral hearing, and extensive written submissions, nothing was put that gives me any concern that the jury must have entertained a doubt. In short, it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond all doubt that MP and GK believed in mayias and evil spirits: that was their sworn evidence. Once it be accepted that the jury was persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that MP and GK believed in curses and black magic, it was a small step to conclude that the applicant had drugged MP and sexually assaulted MP at the three prayer sessions in April and May 2008, exploiting her belief. 

51It follows that I would refuse leave in relation to proposed Ground 2. 

52Although I had read the entirety of FP prior to the hearing of the application, and have returned to it subsequently, I have reached the conclusion that proposed Ground 2 does not warrant a grant of leave independently of the conclusions reached by this Court in that appeal. Were I not of that view, it would then be necessary to consider what was the appropriate level of regard to be had to the overlapping conclusions in that case. The level of overlap is high (for FP challenged her convictions for sexual assaults upon MP and administering an intoxicating substance to her on the same three occasions). In particular, RA Hulme J said at [274]:

""I am satisfied that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that MP was sexually assaulted in the manner in which she claims on each of the three occasions of the prayer sessions. Insofar as one can glean from reading a transcript, her evidence was cogent and consistent. It was supported by the fact of her prompt complaints to her husband of having been sexually assaulted on each occasion. It was further supported by the detail of her complaint to HD. In relation to the latter, I do not think the fact that HD's account did not include MP saying that a penis was forced into her mouth at the second prayer session detracts from the cogency of this evidence, as there is so much in her account that is consistent with MP's evidence. The transposition of apple juice and orange juice in her account is too trivial to be of any concern."" 

53For completeness, I note that there is no inconsistency in my conclusion and the fact that the Court in FP acquitted FP of a charge of conspiracy. That acquittal was on the basis of an absence of evidence linking FP to this aspect of the conspiracy. 

Proposed Ground 1: Verdicts of guilty in relation to the MM counts were unreasonable and/or cannot be supported by the evidence

54The convictions sought to be impugned by proposed Ground 1 were based on sexual assaults by the applicant and by AP upon MM, between 2001 and 2005. There were similarities with the charges involving MP. The similarities included:


The location of prayer sessions in rented rooms (notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had a prayer room at his home), including the Marco Polo motel at Summer Hill;


Both complainants' partners were told to stay some kilometres away from the motel during the women's prayer sessions so that the curse was not transferred;


Both complainants were told to undress and shower and wrap themselves in a towel;


Both complainants were told to shave their body hair, which was burnt at the first prayer session;


Both complainants were blindfolded during prayer sessions and later told to shower and dress while blindfolded;


Both complainants were told that the prayer sessions would feel ""100% real"" but were a dream;


Both complainants were told to drink beverages provided for them;


Both complainants felt dizzy and heavy during and after the prayer sessions;


Both complainants described the applicant's penis as small and struggled to maintain penetration;


Both complainants were told by the applicant to choose third persons to have sexual intercourse, including AP;


Both complainants and their partners received phone calls from demonic voices outside the prayer sessions directing them to participate in prayer sessions with the applicant.

55Some of the details in the evidence of MM and MP were very closely aligned. For example, MM gave evidence that, prior to Count 6, she was instructed by the applicant, who spoke in a different voice which was identified as ""King Russell"" (there were various spellings of this name proffered during the trial however this was the agreed version). King Russell told MM that she must have sex with one of two people, either her father or AP. She said she was given instructions to go to the Marco Polo motel, to invite AP to come and meet her at the hotel room, that when he arrived she was to knock on the back of her room door three times before she was to open it, naked. She was to say ""I want you to have sex with me"" and, when he declined, she was to say ""If you don't I will scream, the neighbours will hear me and I will cause trouble for you"". She was to have oral sex with AP, and was to pinch his nipples, and was told that if she knocked on the door three times as he arrived and left it would erase his memory. 

56On 4 June 2008, AP was recorded by MP, introducing himself as ""the red evil""; as noted above, the transcript of the recording was in evidence and AP accepted (as he had to) that he made the call, at the end of which he was arrested. She was told to meet AP, to say his name three times, that he would have a shower, and while he was doing that, she was to go to his room, take off her clothes, and wait for him behind his door. She was told that he would not agree, and ""The only way to make him agree is to say, ""if you do not fuck me, I will run outside and scream"". She was told to ""Suck him and pinch his nipple"", not to stop until he says to stop and ""When you leave the house, say his name three time again"" because ""When you say his name three time he will be erase everything from his mind by us"" [sic]. 

57MP gave evidence that she did not know and did not recall ever meeting MM. MM said she did not know MP, that her name came to her attention when (in 2008) she was talking with police detectives, and that she was told her name but nothing else. It was put to her in cross-examination that the police detectives ""told you chapter and verse about these allegations"", and that she had ""adopted those details I suggest to you to make a story up regarding [the applicant and AP]"". She denied this. It was open to the jury to accept her denial. 

58Despite those similarities, it should be acknowledged that there were differences between the histories of MM and MP. Those differences were, understandably, at the forefront of the applicant's submissions. Although there were only three prayer sessions with MP (all in 2008), the events relating to MM occupied 2001 to 2005. There was no toxicology evidence in respect of MM, and something must be said of Exhibit J and the more extreme conduct involving MM. 

Exhibit J

59In 2002, MM said that the voice of King Russell called her and required her to ask AP to bring his video camera with him so that he could film their sexual activities. He said ""through the camera and through [AP] he was able to use his power to break the mayia"". He said that ""if you don't do this...your sister will not make it home tonight"". When MM protested about there being a tape, he said:

""When [AP] is finished ... ask him to go to the car and when you get to the car ... ask him for the tape ... On your way home stop at the Cooks River on Canterbury Road"", get out of the car...pray the prayer Our Father once and throw the tape into the river."" 

60MM met AP at the Marco Polo motel but AP claimed he had been followed and they travelled to the Best Western at Ashfield. Their sexual activities were filmed. During the session, FP called her husband AP. On the way home, MM requested and received a video tape from AP which she threw into the Cook's River. 

61MM was asked once again to be filmed having sexual intercourse with AP by King Russell, and she did so at the Marco Polo motel. That occurred, after which SP arrived. MM gave evidence that:

""SP and I argued briefly about why I was there. I didn't provide an answer and eventually just left the Marco Polo and didn't discuss that incident again."" 

62Exhibit J at the trial was a videotape which contained 22 minutes of footage from those two occasions (in reverse order); AP had given MM a different tape which she had thrown into the Cook's River. 

63Exhibit J supported AP's defence that the sexual assaults against MM with which he had been charged were consensual. In any ordinary trial, it might be thought difficult for a jury to convict in the light of Exhibit J. But this was no ordinary trial. The essence of the charges were that the applicant and AP had preyed upon MM's belief in black magic and curses to cause her, without her consent, to have sexual relations with AP. The entire Crown case turned upon the jury being persuaded to the criminal standard that MM and MP believed in evil spirits and were acting under compulsion from King Russell, ""the angels"" or ""the red evil"". 

The threesomes involving MM

64In 2002 King Russell instructed MM that she was to have unprotected sex with someone else. ""He said that the reason I needed to do this was the help that I was receiving from [AP] was no longer enough to break the mayia."" She chose a work colleague, Darren, and followed King Russell's instructions. She was told by King Russell that on the second occasion, ""he was going to send someone to catch me"". MM expected that it would be her boyfriend SP, and said:

""I wanted to get caught. I wanted to be able to tell someone what I was going through. I wanted - I had been isolated from everything and everyone in my life, and I saw this as an opportunity, hopefully thinking that he would just drag me by the hair out of there"". 

65No charges were laid in respect of those occasions with Darren, but counts 12 and 14 of which the applicant was convicted were charges of penile intercourse by Darren at hotels in the CBD and in Coogee, in which MM participated in sexual acts with Darren and Larissa, a former girlfriend of Darren's. King Russell told MM to ask Larissa if she was interested in a threesome with someone else, namely AP. That took place at the Marco Polo motel in the middle of 2002. 

MM's reporting of the assaults to the police

66Ultimately, in July 2007, explicit photos of MM were sent to her husband at the time. MM saw a police officer and gave an interview shortly afterwards. The COPS entry was in evidence, and included:

""In January 2001 the VIC met [AP] and [the applicant] through SP which was her boyfriend at the time. The VIC was told by [AP] and [the applicant] that if she did not pay [the applicant] money her family would be hurt, as the family was cursed under black magic. This continued to occur over a period of a year and the VIC paid [the applicant] a large amount of money over this period. The VIC could not tell police exactly how much she paid [the applicant] in total. As time went on the threats towards the VIC family increased in the severity of violence and this is why the VIC continued to pay [the applicant]. Unknown males who called themselves 'The spirits' were contacting the VIC stating that she had to pay [the applicant] money to stop the curse. [The applicant] never threatened the VIC, he stated he was just doing what the spirits wanted. The VIC did not believe in black magic but was scared what the males would do to her family. 
...
If the VIC did not do what the so called 'Spirits' wanted then they would call her and say that she did not comply with them and as black magic punishment they would bury bones in the VIC front yard and pins and blood would be found on the front steps.
...
Towards the end of 2001 'The spirits' have contacted the VIC and stated that she had to now have sex with [AP] for the curse to stop. The VIC told them she would not do this. The callers have told the VIC that her sister would not live. Each time 'The spirit' callers would call and the VIC would refuse to comply with them, the threat towards the VIC family would increase. The VIC has had intercourse with [AP] on several occasions as she states she was scared that her family would be hurt. [AP] has filmed the sexual intercourse each time it happened with the VIC. The VIC was told by the male 'Spirit' callers that if she told anyone or stopped doing what they said her sister would not make it past 2004 and that the photos of her would be sent to her parents and any future husband."" 

67It may be noted that this complaint, although referring to AP, made no allegation of sexual assault against the applicant. 

Applicant's submissions

68Proposed Ground 1 was the subject of 22 single-spaced pages of submissions directed to emphasising inconsistencies and improbabilities in the Crown case, especially, the reliability of MM. 

69Once again, many of the inconsistencies the subject of written submissions were minor. For example ""by inference [MM] did not know before the meeting that she would be required to be topless. However, [SP] said that he thought there was a mention of it in the park, prior to the meeting"" (para 4.8). 

70On any view, aspects of MM's account were improbable. However, there were remarkable similarities between MM's account and that of MP, as set out above. It was open to the jury to find that the complainants did not know each other, and that their testimony was wholly independent. It was also open to the jury to accept that MM and MP genuinely believed in the power of black magic or mayias. Once that is acknowledged, the superficially improbable accounts were capable of being accepted. 

71There were discrepancies in the interviews given by MM in 2007. In particular, Mr Conditsis relied heavily upon the fact that, when interviewed by Constable Passlow, she made no accusation of sexual intercourse with the applicant, only with AP. Little turns on that. MM's husband had had explicit pictures of his wife and AP sent to him. MM was eight weeks pregnant with the couple's child and her marriage was dissolving. MM also gave candid evidence that with her mother present at the interview ""the last thing I wanted her to know was that I had engaged in sexual acts with an old man"". 

72It is entirely understandable that MM confined her complaint to what was evident from the pictures. In any event, all that matters is that it was open to the jury to believe her testimony, notwithstanding the fact that her complaint in 2007 did not accuse the applicant of any sexual assault. 

73The applicant's submissions made much of what was said to be the inherent unlikelihood of the Crown case. For example, it was said (paras 4.48 and 4.68): 

""It is not credible that MM, an intelligent woman, who on her own evidence had been raped by the applicant in two prior prayer sessions and did not like [AP], would subsequently accept and act upon messages from a Spirit concerning [the applicant and AP]""

Even allowing for MM believing in communication be a ""spirit"", the assertion that anyone with reasonable intelligence would believe that a ""spirit"" would communicate with them via the telephone is absurd. The suggestion that MM believed this to be the case, following all that had allegedly happened to her, cannot be accepted."" 

74But once it is accepted that MM, notwithstanding her education, believed in curses and black magic and the applicant's power to remove them, it was open to the jury to convict. For my part I see no enormous leap of credulity from the premise that there are malevolent spirits to the conclusion that the spirits can communicate by telephone. It was open to the jury to believe the woman's evidence. 

75Similarly, it was said of Exhibit J that (para 4.75):

""It is notable that, notwithstanding these further alleged rapes, MM appeared to enjoy the sexual encounter and did not appear to exhibit signs of distress.""

76It is to be recalled that this jury saw MM over 7 days, and saw Exhibit J, engaging in the actual sexual acts that constituted some of the counts, and saw her answering questions as to why her seeming willing participation came about. This is a trial where the jury had an overwhelming advantage over the appellate court. 

77It was also put that from time to time, MM ""pushed back"" from what the applicant was telling her. She realised that AP did have a memory of the Count 6 when he said ""I had a great time"". She was reluctant to engage in sexual acts with Larissa. Representative of the submissions is para 4.89:

""MM was able to assert herself and said to the the Spirit: Fuck that .. There isn't any way I am going to do this. ... Leave me the fuck alone and stop calling me"". MM then told the jury that The Spirit responded that he would ""stop [her] heart right now"" if she spoke to [it] like that again. It is submitted that MM's evidence, and in particular her alleged belief in the matters she attributes to the Spirit, is simply fantastical.""

78Again, I do not think there is any significant additional force in this submission. Belief in the supernatural need not be unquestioning, or constant over time. The absence of logical coherence with the physical world is of the essence of such a belief. 

79However, I would readily acknowledge that if the Crown case were based merely on MM, then there would be a real question whether the convictions could be sustained. But it was open to the jury to find that the Crown case was established in respect of the sexual assaults upon MP in 2008, based upon her testimony, the toxicology evidence and the telephonic records. There is a remarkable degree of similarity between the account of MM and that of MP. The judge gave a warning about coincidence evidence about which no complaint was or is made. It was open to the jury to conclude that those accounts were wholly independent. Then the only question is whether the presence of Exhibit J, the more extreme nature of the account of MM and the inconsistencies in her evidence disentitled the jury to convict. 

80I conclude that despite being given very full opportunity to demonstrate arguable error, the applicant has failed to demonstrate any substantial prospects of success for proposed Ground 1. In light of the unsatisfactorily explained delay and prejudice, I would refuse leave. 

Proposed Ground 4: The learned trial judge's summing up was unfair and unbalanced resulting in a miscarriage of justice 

81Throughout her Honour's summing up, which occupied two days, counsel for the accused persons were invited (in the absence of the jury) to make any submissions about errors or omissions. Immediately before the conclusion of her summing up, senior counsel then appearing for the applicant complained that her Honour's treatment of the applicant's defence case was inadequate. He said that it was a strong plank of his case that MM's version of events given to Constable Passlow raised 12 issues which would cause the jury to have doubts. He said he had raised a number of matters which were inherently improbable, which had not been dealt with. He submitted that the retraction statement to Detective Kelly, Exhibit 4, was in fact the truth. He said that although her Honour had addressed the similarities between the complainants' evidence, her Honour had said nothing about the dissimilarities. He said that her Honour had not dealt sufficiently with the matters of improbability asserted in relation to his address to the jury, or the differences in relation to the COPS report to Detective Hind-Spiteri. He concluded, respectfully, that her Honour's summing up had not been a balanced one. 

82Save in one respect, this complaint was repeated as proposed Ground 4. 

83Much of the complaint made at trial, and reiterated in this Court, is without factual foundation. For example, her Honour dealt expressly with Exhibit 4 as follows, as the very first example of the inconsistencies between the various accounts given by the complainants. Her Honour said:

""Let me give you an example of that. You will recall that Exhibit 4 is the statement by [MM] in October 2007 to Detective Matthew Kelly in effect saying that she was a willing participant in the sexual acts with the accused [AP]. Obviously that is inconsistent with the evidence that she gave here that at no time did she consent to the acts of sexual intercourse with [AP] and I will be coming to that later."" 

84Her Honour then summarised the Crown argument (that Exhibit 4 was to be assessed in light of the fact that MM's marriage was over and she was pregnant and could be discounted in light of her evidence at trial), and the defence case, namely that Exhibit 4 was clear evidence that the acts of intercourse were consensual. Her Honour then said:

""So that is an example of an issue that you have to decide. Do you accept [MM's] explanation for that statement that she made at the time, or does that statement cause you to doubt her reliability in the account that she has given you here in the witness box?""

85Her Honour reminded the jury that the applicant had called evidence to establish he was a person of good character, with no prior criminal convictions, and her Honour gave the usual direction (about which no complaint is made). Her Honour then summarised his case: 

""Very briefly, I will just remind you of his evidence to this extent, members of the jury, and I will say this, and here I am expressing an opinion, despite the length of time these trials have taken, the issues are really, you might think, quite simple. [The applicant] denied in the witness box that he had ever had sexual intercourse with either of the complainants in the way that they allege, in other words, there was a total denial that he had ever had sexual intercourse with either of the complainants; and in respect of [MM] his sworn evidence was that he had only ever conducted two prayer sessions. Again you have the evidence of [the applicant] already, and I do not propose to summarise his evidence to any extent."" 

86In relation to the inconsistencies and improbabilities in the complainants evidence, her Honour summarised the applicant's counsel's address as follows:

""Mr Greenhill, in respect of [MP] suggested that she would have gone to the police if she had really been sexually assaulted in the way she suggested. He suggested her behaviour was inconsistent with someone who had been sexually assaulted and he reminded you of the terms of her complaint to her husband after the first prayer session, which again, he suggested was inconsistent, or not the words of someone who had truly been sexually assaulted...

Mr Greenhill suggested [GK's] behaviour was inconsistent with such a complaint in that he did not go to the police that day, indeed he went to church. Mr Greenhill also suggested that the fact that [GK] and his wife did not go to the police when they began receiving the text messages which they told you about and which are recorded 23 March 2008, that you would not accept that that was because they were afraid. Mr Greenhill also reminded you that what MP said to Detective Hind-Spiteri on 2 June was that she was digitally penetrated. There was no mention in that account of oral intercourse; that was the second prayer session. And in respect to the third prayer session she said it was apple juice she drank, and she did not mention that someone different entered the motel room. She also mentioned in that account a different hotel or motel. All matters which Mr Greenhill suggested would make you doubt [MP's] reliability. 

In respect of [MM], Mr Greenhill took you to the differences or inconsistencies between her account and that of [SP] and many of you were making notes at that point, and I'm not going to take you through those. That you would not believe she did not tell anyone out of fear, because she had told [SP] in the early days, on her account, at the beginning after the first two encounters. He suggested [MM's] account about King Rasoul, was simply incredible as was her account that she had to choose between her father and [AP], someone to have sex with, and that this was how she commenced to have sex with [AP]. Mr Greenhill reminded you that when [MM] first spoke to her mother about what had allegedly happened she did not mention his client, only [AP] and you would not accept her explanation for that, he said. He suggested that the reason that there was no mention of his client was that the allegations are false. He, in conclusion, suggested that your verdicts would be not guilty in respect of all counts involving his client. 

87It will therefore be seen that many of the specific matters of which counsel complained at trial, which are reiterated in this application, were addressed, squarely, by the primary judge. Further, as is apparent from her Honour's summing up, her Honour was conscious that there had been four days of addresses by the Crown and counsel for the accused persons. Her Honour was well placed to assess how effectively the particular jury had understood the evidence, and counsel's addresses. The reference to ""many of you were making notes at that point"" reproduced above is an indication of that. 

88Ultimately, her Honour was well placed to say, as she did, that in relation to the applicant, the case was straightforward. The impression obtained from reading the closing addresses of the Crown and the defence is that the jury well understood, in relation to the applicant, the relatively straightforward issues for them to decide. There was no question of consent, in contrast to the Crown case against AP; the essential issue was whether, as the complainants asserted, and as the applicant denied, acts of sexual intercourse had taken place at the various prayer sessions. It is clear beyond argument that the jury understood the submissions made on behalf of the accused persons to detract from the credibility of the complainants. 

89Throughout the summing up the trial judge reiterated the simplicity of the issues. For example her Honour said:

""I remind you as I have already reminded you it is very much disputed by [the applicant] that there were any sexual acts at all and only ever two prayer sessions with [MM]. And of course you are well aware that [AP] accepts the sexual intercourse but disputes that it was ever without the consent of [MM]."" 

90In relation to dissimilarities, her Honour reminded the jury that some of the similarities were disputed on the facts. For example, her Honour said: 

""You would be aware that it is in dispute, [the applicant] told you that [MM] was not naked and there were only ever two prayer sessions in any event and that [MP] requested or decided of her own volition to be naked in the prayer session, so that is an example of a live issue that you have to decide what you accept.""

91The obligation upon a trial judge is to sum up in a way that is fair, balanced and impartial: Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 560-1. It is not the length of time devoted to the Crown case or the defence case which matters; it is the ""fairness, balance and impartiality of the summing up which the appellate court must review and safeguard"": R v Inamata (2003) 137 A Crim R 510 at [29], citing R v Courtney-Smith (1990) 48 A Crim R 49. One aspect of Mr Conditsis' complaint is that ""all but about 7 of the approximately 120 pages of her Honour's summing up, other than brief passing references to the applicant's case, dealt with the Crown case"". But as was noted in R v Meher [2004] NSWCA 355 at [86]: 

""Almost inevitably, the bulk of the evidence is led in the prosecution case, and more often than not more time will need to be spent on it.""

Moreover, often the most effective way of the judge fairly putting the gravamen of the defence case to the jury is in the course of summarising the issues for their determination: AP v R [2013] NSWCCA 189 at [24]. 

92The exception referred to above is a written submission made by Mr Conditsis that the trial judge was unjustifiably harsh towards FP when, during the cross-examination of GK and in the presence of the jury, FP yelled out to him from the dock: 

""What did you do to me all those years, what did you do to me [GK]"". 

In the absence of the jury, her Honour said ""I'm not interested in how distressed she is, she must not yell out across the Court"". 

93Mr Conditsis complains that that incident ""perhaps indicated that the learned trial judge was unimpressed with the cases of each of the accused"". The complaint is baseless, unrelated to any proposed ground of appeal and on the material before this Court, could have had no material bearing on the conduct of the trial. The transcript in context (which was not reproduced in Mr Conditsis' submissions) reveals a rapid intervention by her Honour (""just a moment, this isn't between the two of you""), and an immediate adjournment in measured terms (""Step out of the witness-box for a minute. We will take a short break""). Then, in the absence of the jury, her Honour is recorded as saying: 

""Mr Evans, you might tell your client she must remain silent at all points. I'm not interested in how distressed she is, she must not yell across the Court to a witness in this case at all. I will adjourn for five minutes."" 

94There is nothing in this additional submission, which was not the subject of complaint at the trial. 

95More generally, no appellable error has been disclosed in her Honour's summing up. This proposed ground is without merit, and I would not grant leave to raise it. It follows that, once again, it is not necessary to address the situation that would arise if there were an inconsistency with what had been held by this Court in FP (where one ground of appeal was that the summing up was unbalanced and unfair). 

Ground 3: The trial miscarried due to the learned trial judge wrongly refusing the application by the accused to allow MM to be recalled before the jury to give evidence as to whether she had left four telephone messages for the co-accused, [AP], two of which, inter alia, invited [AP] to participate in a threesome with MM and another female 

96On 22 November 2010, the trial judge refused leave for MM to be recalled. That occurred on Day 40 of the trial, after the close of the Crown case, and while AP was giving evidence. Her Honour stated that she would give reasons at a later time, which she did on 7 December 2010, two days before she summed up to the jury. 

97The ruling followed MM being cross-examined on the voir dire in relation to an audio tape which had been seized pursuant to a warrant from AP and identified in the list of items seized as ""1 x mini cassette tape MC-30 Sanyo"" taken from under AP's bed. AP instructed that all four messages recorded on it were MM. The transcript of those messages (VD 17) was as follows:

""21st April at 9:59am
Hey it's me um just wanted to let you know um it it's possible for you to leave work and knock off earlier and to come and meet me at the hotel that we were at the room is room number 20, 1-2-5, and it'll be me and you and um another girl. So yeah you can bring um today as well that would be great. Um yeah so leave home work work home work early that'd be great. Anyway um I'll...to you later. Okay cheers. Bye.

24pm [sic]
Hey. Hey it's me um just wondering what's taking so long. Um I'm here with another girl and um it's just the two of us and we're going for it with each other and um we just wanted you to hurry up and come and joins us and um yeah. So can you come quick and um be with the both of us. We'll see you soon. Um I think that's it. Yeah, we really want you to come and fuck us both but obviously to fuck me more than her. Anyway I'll see you soon. Bye. 

16th May at 3:36pm
Hi. Hi [AP], it's me, [MM]. Um, listen I need a favour. Can you please give this message to Tony for me? Um I'm about to leave a message can you please get it to him so he can hear it? Um it's obviously very difficult for me to speak to him so can you please pass this on. Here goes.

Hi Tony. It's me, [MM]. Um please I'm calling to ask you for your help. I need your help and I need you to please accept to come and help me to pray on me. I know this is difficult for you and I know that I can be a headache sometimes, asking you all the time to come and pray for me but please I need your help and I need you to accept to do this help for me. I feel much better when you pray on me and you give me advice for my life to be able to help me. Please Tony I need your help please accept to help me and to come and to pray on me. I please I need your help. Um I feel much better when you pray and I really need your help. Please accept this. God bless you. Thank you. Bye bye. 

June at 5.56pm [sic]
Hey it's me um listen I was hoping to come down for a little while and um maybe the two of us can have a bit of fun. Anyway, um yeah...shortly be done here shortly. Bye."" 

98MM testified on the voir dire that the third message was her voice, as, perhaps, was the fourth, but that the first and second were not. 

99Initially counsel for the applicant opposed the application to recall MM. Ultimately, he supported it, but made no separate submissions. Counsel for AP said that if the jury accepted that the first and second messages recorded MM, then that would damage her credibility and support his client's defence that the sexual relationship between MM and AP was consensual. 

100The trial judge noted that MM had been in the witness box for six days, that the tape had been in the possession of AP when it was seized and that the matter was raised in Court for the first time on the thirty-eighth day of the trial, MM having been excused on the nineteenth day. Her Honour then stated: 

""Even putting those matters to one side, in my view the tape, exhibit 14 on the voir dire, has little probative value. Even if it is accepted by the jury that [MM's] voice is on all calls contrary to her sworn evidence, it does no more than establish that there was an invitation to the accused [AP] to join her and another woman at a hotel. 

The date is unspecified, as is the place. [Counsel for AP] said from the bar table that his client had declined the invitation. There is already evidence before the jury of a ""threesome"", when [MM] arranged for Larissa to be present. The jury also has exhibit J from which they could infer that [MM] was a willing participant in the sexual activity with the accused [AP], if they did not accept her evidence as to the circumstances in which those sexual encounters took place. 

Finally, having regard to s. 192 of the Evidence Act, the evidence would necessarily add to the length of the hearing. Whether it would do so unduly is not clear. [Counsel for AP] has engaged an expert in voice identification, although no report was available as at Monday 22 November 2010. The ten week estimate the jury was given at the start of the trial is already likely to be exceeded by at least two weeks. In addition, were [MM] to be recalled and the tape admitted, the Crown has flagged a possible application for a case in reply. 

In my view, as I have already indicated, the evidence is not particularly important in terms of the fact in issue. Having regard to all these matters, the application to have [MM] recalled and for the tape to be tendered is refused."" 

101No appellable error is disclosed by that ruling, for these reasons. First, the trial judge, who had the benefit of seeing MM give evidence in relation to the tape on the voir dire, was well placed to assess the probative value of the evidence, to an extent that warrants considerable deference from an appellate court. 

102Secondly, counsel for AP had told the Court that an expert had been retained to provide evidence on whether the voice recorded was that of MM. He said that ""I was hoping to have an oral opinion this morning, I still do not have one as yet"". At no stage in the trial did counsel advise that an expert opinion had been obtained. Had it been obtained, and if it were favourable to AP, it would have been open to counsel to revisit the question. No evidence was led by the applicant in relation to what had occurred in this respect.

103Thirdly, there is self-evident force in the second paragraph of her Honour's reasons extracted above. The jury had heard from both MM and Larissa about the threesome in which they had participated with AP. The jury also had been shown Exhibit J. Only if the Crown could persuade the jury beyond reasonable doubt that those seemingly consensual encounters were brought about by reason of the compulsion by the applicant and AP could there be a conviction. On any view, even if, contrary to what she had said on the voir dire, MM accepted that the first or second recordings were of her voice, it would make no practical difference to the strength of AP's defence. Once again, there is no merit in the proposed ground of appeal. I would refuse leave in respect of it. 

Late Amendment

104On the morning of the second day of the hearing of the application for leave, the applicant sought leave to include a further proposed ground: 

""There was a miscarriage of justice to the Applicant arising directly from the Prosecution's failure to comply with its duty of disclosure, in not disclosing to the Applicant the existence of the audio tape (VD 14) and the nature of its content before trial or at least prior to the evidence in chief of MM."" 

The application was advanced unsupported by evidence, or the precise submissions sought to be made. The application was opposed by the Crown on the basis that no point had been taken at trial, and that it would be necessary to investigate and perhaps put on evidence as to the course of disclosure during the trial. After hearing from the applicant in reply, the Court indicated that leave would be refused, with reasons to be given later. My reasons for joining in that order are as follows.

105The applicant did not dispute that it was appropriate for the Crown to investigate and quite possibly adduce evidence in order to respond to the new ground. In my view, that was no mere hypothetical speculation. Counsel for AP, who had made the call at the trial for the audio tape, and ran the point at trial, was well placed to make submissions as to whether there had been any breach. Not only was no submission that there was a breach of the prosecution's duty of disclosure made, but he, repeatedly, was neutral in his explanations for the lateness of his application. He said ""it is not squarely at the feet of the accused because there was a call, and both of us it would appear missed it. There was a call made and it hasn't been an issue for the simple reason that the Crown much to her credit has been very co-operative"". There was a statement from the Crown that all audio and all video recordings had been brought in ""and the defence were notified that they were available to be viewed and as I understand it two dates were booked for the viewing of that material and it did not eventuate"". In response, counsel for AP said ""in my submission blame is really neutral in this circumstance"". 

106This is not a case where the facts said to constitute the alleged breach of the prosecution's duty of disclosure were unknown until after the trial. There is no need to speculate what would or would not have been uncovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence; cf Grey v The Queen [2001] HCA 65; 75 ALJR 1708. In Grey, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ observed at [23] that: 

""...there was no reason why the defence in a criminal trial should be obliged to fossick for information ... to which it was entitled."" 

The applicant emphasised the passage, but what amounts to ""fossicking"" - in a large trial, where senior and junior counsel have been briefed - falls to be determined by reference to what appears in the immediately following sentence, where their Honours rejected the proposition that reasonable diligence on the part of that appellant's legal advisors would or might have elicited the information, as was noted by Simpson J in R v Livingstone [2004] NSWCCA 407 at [56].

107This serves to illustrate the factual inquiries required. When was the Crown brief provided to counsel for the applicant? What form was the list of exhibits contained? What level of sharing of information was there between counsel for the applicant and counsel for his co-accused, under whose bed the tape had been found, and in whose presence it had been seized pursuant to warrant? (I interpolate that my reading of the transcript tends to confirm what one would expect, namely, that counsel at the very least shared a common understanding about how they would approach witnesses. In particular, senior counsel for the applicant made it plain that he did not expect to cross-examine MM first, in the event that she was recalled: ""Your Honour, I would anticipate my learned friend would cross-examine first about the tapes seeing he's had it in his possession, his client recorded it"". No evidence from the applicant's former senior counsel was supplied at all, and although an affidavit from his former junior counsel was read, it did not adequately address these questions.)

108It is trite that ""the requirements of r 4 [of the Criminal Appeal Rules] do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside"": R v Germakian [2007] NSWCCA 373; 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]. No evidence was adduced explaining why the ground had not been advanced prior to the hearing of the application. The applicant maintained that the submissions and authorities were those contained in his submissions which had been filed on 31 May 2013; it follows that the proposed further ground should have been notified months before the hearing. 

109Further, it is to be recalled that this is an application for leave to extend, very substantially, the time within which to appeal. It is quite different from an application to add a new ground to an existing appeal as of right.

110In my view, bearing in mind that this is merely an application for leave to appeal from a long and factually intensive trial, which had until the second day of the hearing been prepared on a particular basis, it would have been wrong to grant leave to raise a new issue which raises question of fact, which was not taken at trial, which would necessitate an adjournment, and which does not appear in any event to have significant prospects of success. 

Orders

111For the reasons I have given, none of the proposed grounds of appeal has any substantial prospect of success. That, coupled with the lengthy and largely unexplained delay, causes me to propose that an extension of time to appeal should be refused on all proposed grounds. 

112JOHNSON J: For the reasons expressed by Leeming JA, I agree that an extension of time to appeal against conviction should be refused. 

113RS HULME AJ: I also agree with the orders proposed by Leeming JA and with his Honour's reasons.

1On 9 September 2011 Garling J made orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 restraining the disposal or attempt to dispose of the property identified in that order. 

2The Plaintiff now applies to vary the orders made by the inclusion of a number of other properties contained in the schedule to the earlier order. Those properties are in Western Australia. The need to do so appears in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 December 2013. In short, in order for the present Plaintiff to restrain the disposal of assets in Western Australia, it is necessary for a judgment from this Court to that effect to be registered in Western Australia.

3I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the property identified by Mr Spark in his affidavit, and which forms the subject of the present application, ought also to appear in the schedule so that a restraining order can have effect in Western Australia. 

4For that reason, the order made on 9 September 2011 is varied in terms of the order contained in the Notice of Motion dated 10 December 2013 and filed in Court today.

		05 February 2014",2013-12-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762937,New South Wales Crime Commission v Wenping He [2013] NSWSC 1855,"Judgment

1This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. Section 10A enables an application to be made by a party for a restraining order which remains in force whilst, as here, there is an application pending for an unexplained wealth order under s 28A of the Act.

2The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 6 December 2013. In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the Defendants have engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, being the supply of or being involved in the supply of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs contrary to s 25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. These are serious criminal offences as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Act.

3The grounds on which Mr Spark holds this suspicion are set out in paragraphs 4, 9 and 12 of his affidavit. In short, he has read facts sheets obtained from the New South Wales Police, which he has annexed to his affidavit. Mr Spark enquired of each of the officers who prepared the facts sheets, if they had prepared it, whether the officer believed it was true and if the information was obtained by police as a result of investigations described in the facts sheets. The officers concerned confirmed the matters asked of them.

4Section 10A(5) requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 

5I have read the material in the facts sheets regarding each of the Defendants. The matters in those facts sheets, if true, are sufficient to show that the Defendants have been involved in the offences alleged. The matters plainly afford reasonable grounds for the suspicions deposed to by Mr Spark. 

6Having regard to the source of information Mr Spark had and the terms of the emails with the officers who prepared the facts sheets, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for him to form his suspicion on the assumption that the contents of the facts sheets were true.

7I am further satisfied as s 10A(3) requires from the material annexed to Mr Spark's affidavits that the Defendants are domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the restraining orders are sought are situated in New South Wales. 

8Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the Defendants before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred, I do not consider that the Defendants should be given notice of this application before an order is made. I have regard to Mr Spark's long experience in this area that justifies his opinion in relation to the ability to dispose of assets quickly. 

9The Defendants have the ability to make application under s 10C once being apprised of the orders.

10In those circumstances I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 7, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of the draft order provided to me. I grant the leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 8 and 11 of that order.

2762942,New South Wales Crime Commission v Thi Bich Tram Nguyen [2013] NSWSC 1913,"Judgment

1This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990.  Section 10A enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst, as here, there is an application pending for an explained wealth order under s 28A of the Act.  
2The application is made in respect of the Defendant who is the sister of the person said to have committed particular offences which amount to serious crime related activity.  
3The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 12 December 2013.  In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that Van Tan Nguyen has engaged in a serious crime related activity, or serious crime related activities, being the offences of supplying a prohibited drug, knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, both contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, and the supply of a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A of that Act.  Those offences are all serious criminal offences as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Act.  
4The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in paragraph 5 of his affidavit.  In particular Mr Spark received a facts sheet from the investigating officer.  Mr Spark ascertained from that officer that the officer had prepared the facts sheet, that he believed it to be true and correct, and that it had been prepared on the basis of investigation carried out into the activities of Van Tan Nguyen.  
5I have read all of the material contained in the facts sheet, and also the additional material that is exhibited to Mr Spark's affidavit.  I am satisfied that the suspicion that Mr Spark has is one that is held by him on reasonable grounds.  Section 10A(5) of the Act requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion.  
6I am further satisfied that s 10A(3) requires from that material that the Defendant is domiciled in New South Wales, and that the relevant property is also situated in New South Wales.  
7Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit.  In the light of Mr Spark's evidence of the speed and manner in which property can be disposed of, I do not consider the Defendant should be given notice of the application before the order is made.  The Defendant has available rights under s10C of the Act to seek a review of the ex parte order made.  
8Accordingly I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3, 5, 7 and 8 of the draft order, and I grant leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 4 and 6.

		18 December 2013",2013-12-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762950,R v Sio [2013] NSWSC 1872,"Judgment

Introduction

1Daniel Sio was arraigned on an indictment charging him with the murder of Brian Gaudry and armed robbery with wounding at Clyde on 31 October 2012. He pleaded not guilty to both charges. On 23 September 2013 the jury returned a verdict acquitting him of murder and convicting him of armed robbery with wounding.

2Mr Gaudry died as a result of a stab wound inflicted by Mr Filihia, a co-offender. Mr Filihia pleaded guilty to murder and armed robbery. The principal issue in Mr Sio's trial was whether he was party to a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Filihia to commit armed robbery of a brothel in Clyde. The verdict of guilty on the second count indicates that the jury was satisfied that he was. The jury's ""not guilty"" verdict in respect of the murder count was a merciful one and can be seen to equate with the jury's innate sense of fairness and justice: Phillips v The Queen [2006] HCA 4; 225 CLR 303. 

3It follows that Mr Sio is not to be sentenced on the basis that he was responsible for the death of Mr Gaudry.

4The factual basis of his sentence derives from the evidence at the trial and on the sentence hearing. It is slightly different from the facts on the basis of which Mr Filhia was sentenced, since these derived largely from a statement of agreed facts. 

5I have had regard to the principles of parity when sentencing Mr Sio and Mr Filihia, paying due regard to the fact that Mr Filihia is to be sentenced for murder and armed robbery with wounding but Mr Sio is to be sentenced only for armed robbery with wounding.

Evidence

6At the sentence hearing, the Crown tendered Mr Sio's criminal antecedents, which were minor and of no relevance, and his custodial history. The Crown also tendered the autopsy report, a photograph of the knife and its sheath, the transcript of Mr Filihia's record of interview and his statement of 25 October 2012. The Crown also tendered plans of the brothel premises and CCTV footage, which were in evidence at the trial.

7Mr Sio gave evidence at the sentence hearing. Mr Watson, who appeared on his behalf, tendered a report of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 27 November 2013. It will be apparent from my findings of fact that I do not accept Mr Sio's evidence as to the circumstances of the offence and his involvement except where corroborated or against interest. 

Facts

8Mr Sio was familiar with the brothel where Mr Gaudry was killed. A friend of Mr Sio's, Ramon, asked him to look after his girlfriend, Rebecca Gaudiosi, while Ramon was in gaol. Mr Sio often drove Ms Gaudiosi to work at the brothel. Sometimes he went inside and carried her bags to the room where she worked. He came to know the members of staff, including Mr Gaudry, as well as the general layout of the brothel, and its entrance and exit. 

9Mr Sio would also visit Ms Gaudiosi at her flat in Alexandria. They would sometimes smoke methamphetamine, commonly known as ice, together. Mr Sio helped her to recover money from various debtors. He asked her if she would help him to do a robbery at the brothel. Although she declined to take part, she disclosed details about the layout of the premises, the operating hours and when the business was likely to be quiet. She told him that the receptionist generally had about $2,000 in cash on his person and that Mr Gaudry kept the money in a pencil case in his back pocket. 

10Ms Gaudiosi wrote to Ramon every day on A4 paper. She had a considerable number of pads which she kept on a box on her desk in the living room of her flat. One evening, Mr Sio used one of her writing pads to draw a plan of the brothel. He drew a rough plan on a page on which she had already written a ""to do"" list. He added a further item: ""keep tabs on money that Brian's holding"". The reference to ""Brian"" is a reference to Mr Gaudry. On another page in the same pad, Mr Sio drew a detailed plan of the layout of the brothel at Clyde. He left the pad at Ms Gaudiosi's apartment. 

11About five months after the robbery Ms Gaudiosi discovered the pages when she took the pad out of her bag at work to write a letter to Ramon. She provided the pad to police. The only fingerprints on the page that contained the detailed plan were Mr Sio's. His fingerprints were also detected on the page that contained the list and the rough plan.

12Mr Sio knew Sarah Coffison and would often drive her to and from work at sex shops in Liverpool and Beverly Hills. They smoked ice together. They both knew Mr Filihia, who also regularly used ice. 

13Ms Coffison lived in Jannali. Her temporary lodger, Robert O'Hare, owned a sharp-edged hunting knife which he described as a ""Crocodile Dundee"" knife. Some time before the robbery, Mr O'Hare became increasingly concerned about the people who came to the house to smoke ice with Ms Coffison. He put his bowie knife on top of the television unit in the lounge room so that it would be within reach if he needed to defend himself. Shortly before the robbery Mr O'Hare noticed that the knife was missing. When he raised its absence with Ms Coffison, she gave an unsatisfactory answer. Mr O'Hare's knife was the weapon with which Mr Filihia killed Mr Gaudry.

14In early October 2012 Mr O'Hare overheard Mr Sio and Ms Coffison talk about robbing a brothel. 

15On Tuesday 23 October 2012, the day before the robbery, Ms Coffison came across Mr Filihia near Hurstville railway station. He asked her to pass on to Mr Sio that he was looking for him and was now living at the Carss Park Motel. 

16In the meantime, relations between Ms Coffison and Mr O'Hare, which were already strained, deteriorated further. He was distressed because one of his former partners, who was the mother of his child, had died the previous day. He planned to attend her funeral in Coffs Harbour. Although he asked Ms Coffison to ""go easy"" on him, she played rap music loudly, which made it difficult for him to sleep, since he used the couch in the main living area as his bed. 

17When Mr Sio collected Ms Coffison from work on Tuesday night at about 10pm she was reluctant to return home to Jannali because of the tensions with Mr O'Hare. Instead, they went to the beach at Ramsgate and smoked ice. 

18In the early hours of Wednesday morning Mr Sio and Ms Coffison drove to Carss Park Motel where Mr Filihia was waiting for them. Within a couple of minutes Mr Filihia and his partner got into the car and began smoking ice with Mr Sio and Ms Coffison.

19At some point, Mr Filihia's girlfriend left the car and went back inside the motel. Mr Sio told Mr Filihia that he owed money to the finance company for the red Commodore and revealed his plan to rob a brothel at Clyde that morning. When Mr Sio mentioned he was going to collect someone from Cronulla to do the job, Mr Filihia volunteered to do it himself. Mr Filihia needed cash too, in part to pay for the ice, but also because he did not like his family not having their own house and being obliged to stay at the Carss Park Motel. 

20At some point between Carss Park and Clyde, Mr Sio stopped the car and asked Ms Coffison and Mr Filihia to get out and wait for him. He returned to collect them about five minutes later. When the two were back in the car, Mr Sio handed some items to Mr Filihia, who was in the back seat, including clothing for him to wear over his own clothes when committing the robbery. Mr Filihia continued to smoke ice on the way to Clyde.

21The evidence does not establish whether it was Mr Sio or Ms Coffison who took Mr O'Hare's knife from Ms Coffison's house. However, I am satisfied that at some stage, either at Carss Park, or on the way to Clyde, or on arrival at the brothel, Mr Sio gave Mr Filihia the knife so that he could use it, if need be, to rob the brothel.

22When they reached George Street, Clyde at about 5am Mr Sio reversed into a factory driveway some distance from the brothel, stopped the car and turned the engine off. He got out of the car to explain to Mr Filihia, who was affected by ice, the general layout and to point out the location of the entrance and exit. Mr Sio got back into his car and Mr Filihia approached the entrance to the brothel, the bowie knife concealed under this clothes.

23Mr Filihia pushed the buzzer. Mr Gaudry allowed him to enter. There were discussions between them and also between Mr Filihia and a sex worker, after which Mr Gaudry motioned to him along the hallway in the direction of the sex worker. At this point, Mr Filihia withdrew a knife with his right hand from the inside of his hooded jumper and pointed it towards Mr Gaudry who reached out with his left hand several times to ward off the offender. Mr Filihia pulled the hood of his jumper over his head and walked towards Mr Gaudry. They moved into the office area off the hallway.

24Mr Filihia pushed the deceased backwards with his left arm against his face. The deceased grabbed Mr Filihia's left sleeve with his right arm. The deceased stepped back and fell to the ground. Mr Filihia then struck the deceased on the head with the butt of the knife. The deceased managed to stand up and tried to defend himself by pushing and grabbing onto his assailant's clothing. The struggle continued until Mr Filihia stabbed Mr Gaudry in the left side of the chest.

25Mr Gaudry tried to follow Mr Filihia to the exit but collapsed on the way. When Mr Filihia turned and saw Mr Gaudry lying on the floor, he ran back to get the pencil case which he ripped from Mr Gaudry's back pocket. 

26Mr Filihia ran out of the brothel and straight past Mr Sio's car. Mr Sio started the car and caught up with him. Once Mr Filihia was inside the car, Mr Sio accelerated sharply away from the scene. Mr Sio took the pencil case from Mr Filihia. Mr Filihia did not tell Mr Sio or Ms Coffison what had happened because he was so shocked. On the way back to Carss Park Motel they stopped at a park where Mr Filihia disposed of the clothes he had worn over his own clothes for the robbery.

27Mr Filihia was apprehended on Wednesday evening at Hurstville Police Station when he reported for bail for an unrelated offence. He made substantial admissions in a recorded interview. He was arrested and charged.

28On Wednesday evening Mr Sio collected Ms Coffison from work and drove to Rockdale where he parked the red Commodore a couple of streets away from his cousin's place. They removed items from the car, including the knife with which Mr Gaudry had been killed. Mr Sio's cousin then drove them in another vehicle to Ms Coffison's place in Jannali. Either Ms Coffison or Mr Sio brought the knife inside.

29The following day, Thursday 25 October 2012, Mr Sio telephoned Esanda, to try to make an arrangement to repay the arrears on his red Commodore.

30On Friday 26 October 2012, when the police interviewed Mr Sio he told them that he had taken Mr Filihia to the brothel so that he could have sex. He maintained this lie throughout the trial, in that, although he did not give evidence at the trial, his defence was conducted on that basis.

Factors relevant to sentence

31I turn to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). In dealing with the offence I take into account the purposes of sentencing that are set out in s 3A which include punishment, specific and general deterrence, protection of the community, rehabilitation of the offender and a recognition of the harm done to the victim and to the community. 

Maximum penalty, standard non-parole periods and guideline judgments

32The maximum penalty for armed robbery with wounding is 25 years: s 98 of the Crimes Act. A Standard Non-Parole Period (SNPP) of 7 years is prescribed. These are relevant considerations to sentencing: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27].

33The offender relied on the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 (Henry) as indicating an appropriate range for the sentence to be imposed. 

34Henry dealt with armed robbery (s 97) rather than the more serious offence of armed robbery with wounding (s 98). The maximum penalty for armed robbery is 20 years: s 97 of the Crimes Act. Furthermore, subsequent to Henry, the SNPP of 7 years was prescribed for an offence under s 98. There is no SNPP for an offence under s 97. These two matters reduce the relevance of Henry to sentencing for offences against s 98, and in particular those that were committed after the introduction of the SNPP. 

35In Henry at [162] Spigelman CJ identified the following seven features commonly occurring in cases of armed robbery and considered that sentences for offences of that character should generally fall between four and five years for the full term: 
(a)Young offender with no or little criminal history;
(b)Weapon such as a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;
(c)Limited degree of planning;
(d)Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;
(e)Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;
(f)Small amount taken;
(g)Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.

36In the present case, (a) is present since Mr Sio is young and has no relevant criminal history, as is (b) since a large knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury was used. As to (e), I accept that Mr Gaudry was in a vulnerable position, being in commercial premises in an industrial area in the early hours of the morning. There was, for the reasons given in more detail below, a relatively substantial degree of planning on Mr Sio's part. The actual violence was considerable. The amount taken has not been established. Notwithstanding the strength of the Crown case, there was no plea of guilty, although Mr Sio told Dr Nielssen, when he saw him on 26 November 2013, that he would have pleaded guilty to armed robbery if the Crown had dropped the murder count.

37I do not consider that a sentence in the range laid down in Henry would adequately reflect Mr Sio's criminality as established by the jury's verdict and the facts I have set out above. 

Objective seriousness of the offence

38Although Mr Gaudry in fact died as a result of the armed robbery with wounding, Mr Sio is not, for reasons already given, criminally responsible for his death. Accordingly I may not take into account the actual consequences of the armed robbery in determining Mr Sio's sentence: The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383.

39Although Mr Filihia bears sole responsibility for the killing, it was Mr Sio who masterminded the armed robbery. He conceived and planned it for a period of weeks, if not longer. He investigated the layout of the brothel both through personal inspection and questioning Ms Gaudiosi. He ascertained from her the likely proceeds if the robbery were successful. He, either personally or with Ms Coffison's help, procured the weapon for Mr Filihia to use in the armed robbery, at least to threaten the victim. The acts performed by Mr Sio of supplying ice to Mr Filihia, driving his red Commodore for significant distances through the southern and western suburbs of Sydney, instructing Mr Filihia how to rob the brothel, positioning his vehicle some distance from the brothel and driving away from the scene at speed, when taken together, showed considerable planning, deliberation and, in some respects, foresight. 

40Although Mr Sio was smoking ice that morning I do not accept that it affected his capacity to devise and execute his plan to any material degree. 

41While I accept that Mr Sio did not intend the armed robbery to result in any injury, much less death, and may well have instructed Mr Filihia not to hurt Mr Gaudry, I am satisfied that Mr Sio contemplated, when he provided the knife to Mr Filihia, that it would be used in the armed robbery. 

42As sentencing judge I must assess the moral culpability of the offender, which is a separate matter from the objective seriousness of the offence: McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29] per McCallum J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing. This requires a consideration not only of the facts relating to the commission of the offence, but also those that shed light on why it was committed. Mr Sio's motive was financial. This is an aggravating factor. He urgently needed cash to prevent his car from being repossessed. Even if part of his motivation was to obtain money for ice for his own use this explains, but in no way mitigates, his conduct. 

43Mr Sio's involvement in the offence of armed robbery was objectively very serious. Mr Sio recruited Mr Filihia to carry out the armed robbery in order to solve his own immediate financial problems. He was prepared to sacrifice Mr Filihia, whom he knew would be filmed on the CCTV cameras within and surrounding the brothel, to his own ends. That he did not enter the brothel himself was a reflection of his capacity to have Mr Filihia bear the substantial risk of the enterprise, including the risk of detection. Mr Sio's criminality was high. I find the objective seriousness of the offence to be above the mid-range for offences under s 98.

Subjective circumstances

44Mr Sio was born on 18 July 1991. At the time of the robbery he was 21 years old. He is now 22. He has a partner, Georgina, who is 21, and a son Cortez, who is 4 and a half months old. Georgina visits him twice a week in gaol. Mr Sio has not seen his natural father since he left New Zealand at the age of 7. Otherwise he has a supportive extended family.

45Mr Sio started taking drugs at a young age to deal with being bullied at school. When his grandmother became unwell in early 2012 he started smoking ice. He was using marijuana and ice at the time of the robbery. He lost touch with his family because of his drug-taking. While he was taking drugs he rarely saw Georgina although he did see her sometimes. Cortez was conceived at around the time of this offence. During this period he rarely attended St Luke's Catholic Church at Revesby, although he had been a regular member of the congregation in the past.

46In his report dated 21 November 2013 Dr Nielssen opined, on the basis of Mr Sio's use of marijuana and methamphetamine, that he had substance abuse disorder but that it was in remission. Dr Nielssen assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as good because of his family support and an absence of anti-social conduct in his adolescence. In evidence at the sentence hearing Mr Sio expressed an intention to undertake drug rehabilitation courses, as well as any suitable vocational courses that are available to him in custody.

Other matters relevant to sentencing 

47Mr Sio is entitled to have the time spent in custody taken into account in the sentence. He was arrested on 26 October 2012 and granted bail on 27 March 2013. He was remanded in custody following conviction on 23 September 2013 and has remained in custody since. I propose to backdate the sentence to start on 24 April 2013 to take account of the time spent in custody.

48That the armed robbery was, as far as Mr Sio was concerned, part of a planned activity is an aggravating factor. That the offender has no material record of previous convictions is a mitigating factor.

49Mr Sio has some prospects of rehabilitation in that he is young and has a supportive, loving partner and extended family. I am not, however, satisfied that his prospects of rehabilitation are good given his immaturity and failure to accept responsibility for his involvement in the armed robbery in the evidence to which I will refer below. Much will depend on the extent to which he can overcome his tendency to resort to drug-taking at times of anxiety or stress.

50I do not accept Mr Sio's expressions of remorse as genuine. I am not satisfied that he accepts responsibility for his actions. He sought, in my view, to minimise the extent of his responsibility for the armed robbery and to blame others, including Ms Coffison, Mr Filihia and Ms Gaudiosi. For example he said that it was Ms Gaudiosi's idea that he rob the brothel. He gave evidence that he had merely been present when the topic of a robbery came up between Ms Coffison and Mr Filihia. He said in evidence at the sentence hearing:
""Mr Filihia wanted to purchase some more ice but had no money and wanted to do a robbery to get some money to get some more. At the time it was very early in the morning. There wasn't anywhere he could go close by to rob a place, and me and Sarah Coffison had been at the brothel before so she could sell ice and she knew it was opened . . .""

51He sought to confine his role to that of a driver. He maintained that he first became aware of the existence of the knife when Mr Filihia came out of the brothel and that he did not know where it came from. He denied that he drew the plans of the brothel. In cross-examination he said that he had seen Ms Gaudiosi draw them but then contradicted himself by denying that he had ever seen them before the trial.

52It was only in response to his counsel's leading questions that he admitted that he was under financial pressure at the time of the robbery. Nonetheless he insisted that it was not a ""big factor"".

53One of the few truthful pieces of evidence he gave at the sentence hearing was that he lied when he told the police that he took Mr Filihia to the brothel so that he could have sex. 

54Mr Watson submitted that I should take into account the formal admissions that Mr Sio made which were, in substance, that Mr Filihia had killed Mr Gaudry in the course of the armed robbery. He submitted that these admissions shortened the trial. Although these admissions were useful in establishing such matters formally, their substance was evident from the CCTV footage that was tendered in the Crown case. I do not consider the formal admissions to have had any substantial effect on the length of the trial or the evidence required to be adduced by the Crown. Accordingly I do not propose to reduce the sentence on that ground.

Special circumstances

55Mr Watson submitted that I should make a finding of special circumstances on the grounds of Mr Sio's youth and that it is his first time in custody. 

56I am not persuaded that there are special circumstances in the instant case. Nor am I persuaded that if I had found special circumstances there would be any proper basis to disturb the ratio. The non-parole period needs to be of sufficient length having regard to the factors referred to above, of which the most significant are the objective seriousness of the offence and the need to protect the public.

2762954,R v Tuki (No. 4) [2013] NSWSC 1864,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1JOHNSON J: The Offender, Ray Tuki, appears for sentence with respect to a number of serious offences.

2On 4 October 2013, the Offender was arraigned upon an indictment containing eight counts. The Offender pleaded guilty to four counts on the indictment, and it was agreed that a fifth count be dealt with on a Form 1. The Crown accepted these pleas, and the Form 1 agreement, in full discharge of the indictment. 

3The Offender pleaded guilty to the following offences:

(a)Count 1 - between 1 June 2010 and 4 July 2010 at Villawood and other Sydney suburbs, he did participate in a criminal group, knowing that it was a criminal group and knowing his participation in that group contributed to the occurrence of criminal activity (an offence under s.93T(1) Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment);

(b)Count 5 - on 2 July 2010 at Chester Hill, knowing that MA, Thomas Byquar, Tomasi Natuba, Mahdi Mir and others on 1 July 2010 at Lurnea in the State of New South Wales committed a robbery of Tracey Burgess whilst armed with an offensive weapon and at the time caused grievous bodily harm upon Kesley Burgess, he afterwards did assist MA, Thomas Byquar, Tomasi Natuba, Mahdi Mir and others (an offence under s.349(2) Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment);

(c)Count 7 - on 4 July 2010 at Miller, while in company of Mohammad Jawad Karimi and other persons, he possessed an offensive weapon, namely a shortened .22 calibre long rifle, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely intentionally cause grievous bodily harm to an unknown person (an offence under s.33B(2) Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment);

(d)Count 8 - on 4 July 2010 at Miller, he did possess a prohibited firearm, namely a shortened .22 calibre long rifle without being authorised to do so by a licence or permit (an offence under s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 with a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of three years).

4In passing sentence on Count 5, the Offender has asked the Court to take into account on a Form 1, a further offence under s.349(2) Crimes Act 1900 in the following terms - On 2 July 2010 at Chester Hill, knowing that MA, Thomas Byquar, Tomasi Natuba, Mahdi Mir and others on 1 July 2010 at Warwick Farm committed a robbery of Maxine Rogers whilst armed with an offensive weapon, he afterwards did receive, harbour, maintain and assist MA, Thomas Byquar, Tomasi Natuba, Mahdi Mir and others. 

5If prosecuted separately, the Form 1 offence would be punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.

6A sentencing hearing proceeded before me on 22 November 2013, with the Offender then remanded for sentence today. 

History of Proceedings Against Offender

7It is appropriate to refer to the history of proceedings against the Offender. This is relevant to a number of issues, including the discount to be afforded to him for his pleas of guilty. 

8In circumstances to be described shortly, the Offender was arrested on 4 July 2010. He was charged with a number of serious offences. 

9At the time of the commission of the present offences, the Offender was on bail for other matters which, in due course, came before the Parramatta District Court. An issue as to fitness to be tried was raised concerning the Offender with respect to the District Court matters. On 21 November 2011, he was found unfit to be tried upon those matters and his case was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal""). On 14 March 2012, the Tribunal determined that the Offender remained unfit for trial upon the District Court matters and that it was unlikely that he would become fit within the next 12 months. In due course, a special hearing was listed in the District Court for 4 March 2013. 

10On 18 June 2012, the Offender was committed for trial on the Supreme Court matters. He appeared in the Arraignments List on 3 August 2012, but was not arraigned, as a question as to his fitness to be tried had arisen. 

11On 23 November 2012, a fitness hearing proceeded before me, at which I found that the Offender was not fit to be tried on the Supreme Court matters: R v Tuki [2012] NSWSC 1436.

12As a result of my finding, the Offender was referred to the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. 

13On 28 February 2013, the Tribunal determined that the Offender had become fit to be tried for both the District Court and the Supreme Court matters. The District Court special hearing did not proceed on 4 March 2013, with the matters being adjourned until April 2013 for that Court to undertake a further fitness hearing. 

14On 15 March 2013, I conducted a further fitness hearing, after which the Offender was found fit to be tried for the Supreme Court matters: R v Tuki (No. 3) [2013] NSWSC 203. At that time, it was not possible to join the Offender to the trial of other persons (John Khoury, Mohammad Jawad Karimi and Mahdi Mir) which commenced before a jury on 18 March 2013. 

15The Offender's matters were placed in the Arraignments List for 5 April 2013 and were thereafter adjourned, by consent, until following negotiations between the legal representatives for the Crown and the Offender, pleas of guilty were entered in the manner in which I have described on 4 October 2013, with those pleas being accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment.

16Counsel for the Offender submitted that he should receive a 25% discount on sentence for his pleas of guilty, in circumstances where, for a very large part of the period since he was arrested and charged, the Offender has been unfit to be tried. It was submitted that the Court should approach the Offender's pleas as being entered at the earliest possible opportunity. 

17The Crown accepted that the Offender's legal representatives were not in a position to obtain instructions from him in relation to a plea until it was determined that he was fit to be tried. It was noted, as well, that Count 1 had not been an original charge, but had been included as a result of an ex officio direction after the Offender had been found fit to be tried in the Supreme Court. The Crown submitted that it was open to the Court to extend a 25% discount to the Offender in these circumstances. 

18It is the case that the Offender had been found unfit to be tried with respect to the District Court matters on 21 November 2011. It seems clear that he would not be fit to be tried (or to enter a plea) upon the Supreme Court matters for the same reason. This state of affairs continued and existed at the time of his committal for trial on 18 June 2012. He did not become fit to be tried (or to enter a plea) until 15 March 2013. It was only after that finding had been made that his legal representatives were in a position to take instructions from him for the purpose of advising him as to a plea. He was not arraigned in the Supreme Court until 4 October 2013, at which time the pleas described earlier were entered. 

19In these unusual circumstances, I am prepared to allow the Offender the benefit of a discount of 25% for his pleas of guilty: R v Zeilaa [2009] NSWSC 532 at [17]-[19]; Hawkins v R [2011] NSWCCA 153 at [22]-[26].


Other Persons Sentenced Arising Out of Related Criminal Activity

20A number of persons have been sentenced for a range of offences in this Court and the District Court, with those offences being related, in one way or another, to those for which the Offender is to be sentenced. It is not necessary to recite in detail those persons and their offences and sentences in these remarks on sentence. A list of the persons, and decisions of Courts which have passed sentence upon each of them, is contained in my sentencing decision of 29 November 2013 - R v Karimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No. 11) [2013] NSWSC 1761 at [11]-[13] (and in earlier sentencing decisions referred to in that judgment). 

21The offences for which the Offender is to be sentenced are different, in a number of significant respects, from those for which other persons have been sentenced. 

Findings of Fact

22A lengthy Agreed Statement of Facts was placed before the Court for the purpose of sentencing the Offender. It is not necessary to set out in these remarks the very considerable detail contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts. It will suffice to refer to an overview of the facts, followed by an assessment of the role of this Offender in the crimes for which he is to be sentenced.

23It will be observed that Count 1 picks up the participation by the Offender in a criminal group in a period between 1 June 2010 and 4 July 2010. During this period, the specific offences contained in Counts 5, 7 and 8 and in the Form 1 offence were committed.




Participation in a Criminal Group in June 2010

24In June 2010, the Offender (then aged 20 years) was living with his partner, Kayla Rosso, in a bed-sitter unit at Villawood. Living in the adjoining bed-sitter unit were John Khoury (""Khoury"") (29 years old) and his partner, Aimee Walsh (""Walsh"") (18 years old).

25In a period encompassing at least 1 June 2010 to 4 July 2010, Khoury was the head of a criminal group involved in the supply of ice, methylamphetamine and cannabis. The group was known as the United Brotherhood and the Offender was a member of the group. Khoury was looking to expand the drug business of the criminal group by putting out of business other drug suppliers in the area of south-western Sydney. The plan was to conduct armed home invasions of persons believed to be drug dealers, with the intention of terrorising the occupants of houses and taking drugs and money. To achieve this aim, Khoury looked to recruit more persons to the group.

26In June 2010, the Offender was assisting Khoury and a co-offender, Mohammad Jawad Karimi (""Karimi"") (22 years old), with respect to drug supply. In that context, they met Anaterea Tamapua (""Tamapua"") (20 years old), a criminal with whom Khoury determined to form an alliance.

27Over a period of days, the criminal group met at Khoury's Villawood address, known as ""the Compound"". Plans were made to carry out home invasions. For this purpose, Tamapua arranged for a number of young men, who had worked with him in other criminal enterprises, to become involved.

28On 29 June 2010, a meeting took place at the Compound and a plan was hatched for an armed robbery to be carried out on the premises of an uncle of an ex-girlfriend of Khoury. The plan was to rob a number of firearms lawfully retained at premises in Lakemba, including a .357 Desert Eagle semi-automatic handgun which Khoury had a particular desire to obtain. There was also a plan to carry out a home invasion at premises at Ashcroft which were believed to be occupied by a drug dealer. 

29On 29 June 2010, a number of young men set off to carry out the home invasion of the Lakemba premises to obtain the firearms. They were armed with a shortened .22 calibre long rifle. 

30Before the group of home invaders left the Compound, the Offender took his partner, Kayla Rosso, to the Liverpool Hospital Casualty section for attention.

31The group of invaders were unsuccessful in their attempt to carry out a robbery of the Lakemba premises to obtain firearms. They returned to the Compound, where Khoury was told what had happened. Thereafter, it was decided that the group would carry out the home invasion of the Ashcroft premises. 

32The group of home invaders set off in a vehicle for this purpose, with one of them armed on this occasion with a machete, and another with the shortened .22 calibre long rifle. 

33The group carried out a home invasion of the Ashcroft premises occupied by James Stiff and his family. As the home invaders burst into the premises, one of them struck James Stiff to the left arm with the machete causing a deep cut down to the bone. Demands were made for property. After a no-doubt terrifying process of threats and the use of force, the group left the Ashcroft premises with a plastic container in which there was a small quantity of cannabis. A laptop computer was also stolen from the premises. 

34Immediately after the home invaders departed, Kearin Stiff, the son of James Stiff, took his father to Liverpool Hospital for emergency treatment. James Stiff's left arm was bleeding heavily and was wrapped in a shirt. 

35Coincidentally, the Offender, who was still at Liverpool Hospital with his partner, observed the badly injured James Stiff and his son enter the Emergency Department. The Offender immediately connected this event with the home invasion which he understood was to be carried out that night. Over a period of time, the Offender made telephone contact with Khoury to report to him what was happening at the hospital with respect to the victim of the home invasion.

Events on 1-2 July 2010 - Count 5 and the Form 1 Offence

36On the afternoon and evening of 1 July 2010, a number of members of the criminal group assembled at Chester Hill. At that time, Khoury was taking over shop premises at 182 Waldron Road, Chester Hill, to operate as a type of variety store.

37Tamapua, Thomas Byquar (""Byquar"") (18 years old) and others arrived at Chester Hill by train in the early evening. They walked to Khoury's shop where they met Khoury, Karimi, Walsh and the Offender. Also present was Mahdi Mir (""Mir"") (20 years old), the cousin of Karimi, and Eliza Brown (18 years old), a friend of Mir. Tamapua introduced Byquar to Khoury. Khoury asked Byquar if any more boys could be recruited as there was going to be ""a test tonight"". Byquar sent a text message to his cousin, Tomasi Natuba (""Natuba"") (19 years old), asking if he wanted to be recruited to ""United"". Natuba agreed and he set off for Chester Hill.

38In the meantime, a group of people including Tamapua, Byquar, Karimi, Mir and Eliza Brown went to the nearby Chester Hill hotel to await the arrival of Natuba. Whilst at the hotel, others arrived there, including the Offender. 

39Discussions took place between the Offender and Tamapua to arrange transport for the upcoming criminal activities. 

40Soon after 9.45 pm on 1 July 2010, the members of the group left the Chester Hill Hotel and walked to Khoury's shop. Discussions took place there in the presence of the Offender. Those discussions included the introduction of Natuba to Khoury, the selection of two home invasions to be carried out that night - the ""Beanie Boy"" job at Warwick Farm and the ""Jacob job"" at Lurnea. The persons to carry out these two home invasions were selected following discussions between Khoury, Karimi and Tamapua, with MA (17 years old), Byquar, Natuba and Mir being selected. Khoury had a number of boxes of Elephant brand meat cleavers in the shop. Khoury obtained four of these heavy meat cleavers which were given to the four men who were to carry out the home invasions that night, together with gloves. 

41Byquar, Natuba, Mir and MA travelled in a Tarago Van, together with Tamapua and Karimi, with the vehicle driven by David Ramos (""Ramos"") (18 years old). The Offender, together with Khoury, Walsh and other persons, remained at Khoury's shop.

42At about 10.45 pm, Byquar, Natuba, MA and Mir entered premises on the Hume Highway, Warwick Farm, each armed with a meat cleaver and each wearing gloves. It was believed (wrongly) that these were the premises of ""Beanie Boy"", a person known to Tamapua. In fact, the premises were occupied by Maxine Rogers (41 years old) and her two daughters (aged nine and 10).

43The four home invaders entered the premises demanding drugs and money. An unsuccessful search was made of the premises for drugs and money, and the invaders stole the mobile phone of Maxine Rogers and a laptop computer which they found in the premises. It was assistance provided by the Offender to these home invaders in the early hours of 2 July 2010, which gave rise to the offence contained on the Form 1. 

44The group in the Tarago Van then set off to carry out the ""Jacob job"" at Lurnea. Karimi guided the others to his cousin's premises at Granville, so as to obtain precise directions to the Lurnea premises. Karimi and Tamapua entered a white car driven by an associate of Karimi and the two vehicles travelled together to the Burgess premises in Clingan Avenue, Lurnea.

45Karimi pointed out the house which was associated with Jacob Burgess. The same four home invaders (Byquar, Natuba, MA and Mir) got out of the Tarago Van, with each being armed with a meat cleaver. The four men went to the front of the Burgess house. At that time, the occupants of the house were Tracey Burgess (47 years old), her son, Kesley Burgess (25 years old), his girlfriend, Kristal McLachlan (24 years old), and a family friend, Gary Venus (56 years old). Jacob Burgess was not in the house at that time.

46The invaders knocked on the door and Gary Venus opened it. At that point, the four men burst into the premises, pushing Gary Venus to the floor. Tracey Burgess came out of her bedroom and saw the armed men in the house. Natuba ran after Tracey Burgess down a corridor leading to the bedrooms. Natuba demanded to know the location of drugs and cash. Natuba grabbed Tracey Burgess by her nightie and pushed her whilst demanding money. He threatened to kill her whilst swinging his meat cleaver towards her, with the tip of the blade glancing the palm of her left hand before impacting heavily on the laundry door. 

47Kesley Burgess opened his bedroom door and saw Natuba attacking his mother. Kesley Burgess armed himself with a sword that was located in the house and told Kristal McLachlan to stay in the room. Kesley Burgess also pushed his mother into the bedroom with Kristal McLachlan. 

48Kesley Burgess lunged at Natuba, wounding him in the shoulder. A ""000"" call was made by Kristal McLachlan when one of the invaders demanded that she cease. 

49After Kesley Burgess had struck and wounded Natuba, the home invaders turned on Kesley Burgess striking him with their meat cleavers. Natuba himself, in a state of rage, turned over a coffee table and struck Kesley Burgess with a meat cleaver.

50Kesley Burgess had suffered a series of very severe wounds to various parts of his body. The characteristics of his wounds indicated that they had been inflicted by sharp-edged instruments in a chopping or slashing motion.

51Tracey Burgess witnessed the attack upon her son. She went into the kitchen a grabbed a tin in the shape of a Jim Beam racing car containing some cannabis, and threw the tin at one of the invaders. Before leaving, the invaders stole Tracey Burgess' handbag and beach bag which were located in the premises.

52Emergency assistance was summonsed to the house. Efforts were made to treat Kesley Burgess who was transported to Liverpool Hospital. He passed away at 9.15 pm on 2 July 2010. 

53The invaders fled the Burgess house and returned to the two vehicles parked nearby. The group returned to Khoury's shop at Chester Hill, arriving soon after midnight. Khoury, the Offender and others were waiting in the shop when the occupants of the two vehicles returned. There was discussion about what had happened during the offences. Mir stated that he had chopped Kesley Burgess with a meat cleaver. Byquar also detailed to the group what he had done, including a swing at the victim which missed, hitting Byquar's own toe. 

54There was discussion concerning what was to be done about Natuba's injury. The Offender assisted Natuba by attending to his injury and bandaging it with some clothing.

55Three bloodstained meat cleavers had been placed on a towel in the back of Khoury's shop. The Offender was standing at a sink, and he commenced to wash blood off the meat cleavers which had been used in the attack upon Kesley Burgess. 

56Natuba was conveyed to Bankstown Hospital by two members of the group. A false story had been devised to explain how Natuba had come to be injured and, initially, he gave this false account to hospital staff and police who later attended the hospital. After some hours, Natuba told the truth to police about what had happened that night, and thereafter he assisted the police with their investigation. During 2 July 2010, police obtained warrants for telephone intercepts with respect to the telephones of a number of persons, including Tamapua. 

57The actions taken by the Offender in the early hours of 2 July 2010 at Khoury's shop constituted the offences contained in Count 5 and the Form 1 offence. 

Events on 3-4 July 2010 - Counts 7 and 8

58On the morning of 3 July 2010, major media outlets were reporting that Kesley Burgess had died. During the afternoon of 3 July 2010, a meeting took place in Khoury's unit at Villawood, attended by (amongst others) Khoury, Tamapua and Karimi, at which Byquar introduced John Unasa (""Unasa"") (19 years old) to the group. Discussion took place in which Unasa was recruited to the group for the purpose of carrying out home invasions. 

59At about 6.00 pm, Byquar and Unasa left the Compound. At about 7.25 pm, surveillance operatives observed Khoury, Tamapua, the Offender and others at the Compound. The group discussed the death of Kesley Burgess.

60On the evening of 3 July 2010, Unasa and Byquar attended the Michael Wenden Aquatic Centre at Miller, where a Polynesian night was to take place to raise funds. About 350-400 people of Polynesian descent, including families with children, attended the event where food and alcohol were being consumed. Security guards were in place to provide security.

61Later that evening, Unasa, Byquar and a couple of other males became involved in a confrontation with a male who was allegedly part of a gang called the ""Miller Boys"". One of the security guards saw a group of males (including Unasa) having an argument with another group of males, who were urging Unasa's group to come up the road to fight them. A bottle was thrown at Unasa's group, leading to the security guard urging the young men to calm down as they were present at a charity event. Security guards arranged for Unasa and his group to be taken inside to avoid a further confrontation. The security guards called police and, when the police arrived, the other group were seen to disperse and leave the area.

62As Unasa was being told to go inside by security guards, he told Byquar to ""ring the boys and get them to come down"". Byquar then used his mobile phone to call other members of the United Brotherhood to help them. A series of telephone calls then ensued, with many of the calls being intercepted by police. 

63A number of the telephone calls are reproduced in the Agreed Statement of Facts. Between 11.28 pm on 3 July 2010 and about 1.00 am on 4 July 2010, calls were made revealing a highly agitated Byquar calling for reinforcements to attend Miller with guns, knives and ""choppers"". At various times, Byquar said (to Karimi), ""There's going to be a killing spree"", ""We will stab these cunts bro"", ""We're gonna kill them tonight"", with variations on these themes being repeated. 

64At one point, at 11.55 pm, the Offender spoke to Tamapua and there was discussion that Unasa was in trouble at Miller. The Offender said, ""I'm heading back to the compound to get something and then will head to get you straight away ... My Mrs is driving"". 

65At 11.59 pm, the Offender spoke to an unknown male, and the two men discussed Byquar's problem and the call for help which had been made. The Offender said, ""I'm going to pick him up in five seconds, I'm just gonna go home and grab the little friend, I'm gonna go home and grab the little friend and then bang I'm there"".

66The content of this call clearly relates to the Offender obtaining arms for the purpose of attending Miller, with others, to assist Byquar in the planned violent confrontation which had been discussed.

67Other calls took place indicating the movement of persons to Khoury's unit at Villawood to obtain weapons, and then to Tamapua's home at Claymore with a group of four men then heading to Miller. 

68The journey was made in a white Ford Laser owned by the Offender's partner, Kayla Rosso. She drove the Offender and Richard Vergara (19 years old) (""Vergara"") to Tamapua's premises at Claymore. She remained at those premises with Tamapua's partner. The Offender then drove the white Ford Laser in which Vergara, Tamapua and Karimi travelled. 

69Telephone contact was maintained during the journey with discussions occurring with Byquar and Khoury, amongst others. 

70At about 1.15 am, police intercepted the white Ford Laser near Maxwells Avenue, Miller. Understandably, given the discussions overheard by way of telephone intercepts, police were concerned as to what would happen should the vehicle (and its occupants) link up with Byquar at Miller. 

71Police located a pocket knife in the Offender's front right pocket. A sheath containing a machete (which had been used in the home invasion at Ashcroft in which James Stiff was injured) was located in the rear of the vehicle. A bag containing the shortened .22 calibre long rifle (also used in the offences committed on 29 June 2010) was located in the rear of the vehicle. The firearm was in working order and was loaded with one round of ammunition in the breach. A knife was located in the boot of the vehicle.

72In due course, Khoury's DNA was located on the trigger area of the firearm. A partial DNA profile of James Stiff was obtained from the machete.

73Khoury and Byquar spoke by telephone after 1.20 am concerning the whereabouts of the reinforcements travelling in the Ford Laser. Unbeknown to Khoury and Byquar, police had intercepted the vehicle and arrested its occupants. 

74Following his arrest, the Offender participated in an electronically recorded interview with police in which he denied (falsely) knowledge of the purpose of the journey to Miller, although admitting that he had been driving the vehicle owned by his partner.

75Following their arrest, the Offender, Karimi, Vergara, Tamapua and Byquar (who had himself been arrested at 1.30 am), were taken to Liverpool Police Station. Listening devices (obtained lawfully under warrant) were located in the cells of the police station, and conversations were recorded between these men on 4 and 5 July 2010.

76By way of example, the Offender is recorded talking to Byquar and Karimi and saying, with respect to Natuba, ""Brother, he fuckin leaked, brother he knows he told everyone who the little brother is, who the sister is, who the uncle is, the big brother the big brother everything bro"". 

77A little later, the Offender says ""Straight out bro this cunt's dogging us I'll tell you now"". Soon after, the Offender said, ""Who gave up the shop? ... Because they asked me and Ricky [Vergara] about it today"".

78In further discussion with Karimi, the Offender said, ""Did you know brother's house was being watched? ... Brother's house was being watched, the compound"". 

79Karimi asked what happened to ""brother"", with the Offender replying, ""He's on the run lad ... My Mrs went back there when we got done and that brother left straight away"".

80In later conversation after Tamapua had been placed in the cells, the Offender said, ""Masi [Natuba] gave up the older brothers too"".

81The recorded conversations demonstrate clearly the knowledge which the Offender had of the criminal group and its structure and activities, together with his support for the group.

Evidence from Khoury's Shop

82At 11.04 am on 4 July 2010, an SMS message was intercepted between associates of the involved parties which read, ""Guess what bishop [Khoury] and amy [Walsh] packed up and chucked a runner"". 

83On 4 July 2010, police executed a crime scene warrant at Khoury's shop, with forensic examination of the premises continuing over a three-day period. The examination found several sources of human blood and extensive evidence of blood cleanup. Subsequent analysis identified the blood as being that of Natuba and Byquar.

84The Jim Beam tin taken from the Burgess house was found inside Khoury's shop, with blood smears on it. Fingerprints belonging to Karimi, Khoury and Walsh were detected on the tin, as well as the DNA and fingerprints of Kesley Burgess.

85Fingerprints belonging to Khoury, the Offender, Vergara, Karimi, Walsh and MA were found at different areas within Khoury's shop.

86Police also located numerous Elephant brand meat cleavers in the shop.

87After the arrest of co-offenders on 4 July 2010, Khoury and Walsh moved out of the Compound and lived with Khoury's parents for a short time. It also appeared that they vacated Khoury's shop.

88In the early hours of 29 September 2010, police arrested Khoury and Walsh at premises in Lancaster Street, Ingleburn. A search warrant was executed on the premises and located there was a bag containing three Elephant brand meat cleavers wrapped in a towel. 

89Forensic analysis of the meat cleavers revealed the Offender's fingerprint on the blade of one of the meat cleavers, the Offender's DNA on the handle of one of the weapons and blood of Kesley Burgess on the blade of one of the meat cleavers.

Conduct of the Offender Relied Upon With Respect to the Offences For Which Sentence is to be Passed

90The preceding narrative refers to a range of events and activities involving the Offender in a period between 1 June 2010 and 4 July 2010. 

91The Agreed Statement of Facts draws together a number of matters to shed light upon the particular offences for which the Offender is to be sentenced. It is useful to refer to these matters to encapsulate the criminality involved on the part of the Offender with respect to Counts 1, 5, 7 and 8, and the Form 1 offence to be taken into account on sentence for Count 5.



Count 1 - Participation in a Criminal Group

92For the purpose of this offence, reliance is placed by the Crown on acts of participation of the Offender in the criminal group known as United Brotherhood, other than the acts founding specific offences for which the Offender is to be sentenced.

93These acts include:

(a)participation in the drug business of the group - the Offender occupied a position in the group as Khoury's ""left hand man"" (with Karimi being the ""right hand man"") - the Offender would assist in the collection of drug supply money for Khoury and assisted in the standing over of a drug dealer (Kevin), who had been slow in paying;

(b)the Offender's role in contacting Tamapua and taking him to the Compound to meet Khoury, and his attesting that Tamapua (whom he knew) was trustworthy to join the group and participate in their criminal activities;

(c)telephone calls made by the Offender on 29 June 2010 to Tamapua, Vergara and MA, leading to the criminal group meeting at the Compound to discuss and plan jobs, and the Offender's presence in the early evening at the Compound where planning for the Lakemba job (to obtain firearms) was discussed, before the Offender took his partner to Liverpool Hospital;

(d)the presence of the Offender at Khoury's shop at Chester Hill with members of the criminal group, during an altercation on 30 June 2010, and his actions to support members in a confrontation that day;

(e)the Offender's call to Khoury from Liverpool Hospital on 29 June 2010, informing him of the arrival of the injured James Stiff, and later calls keeping Khoury informed as to what was happening at the hospital;

(f)the Offender's acts on 1 July 2010 prior to a decision being made as to the two jobs to be carried out that night - this included directing Tamapua and those with him to attend the shop at Chester Hill, the Offender's presence when discussions took place about recruiting other persons, and later on entering the Chester Hill Hotel and telling Tamapua to get a car, which resulted in contact being made with Ramos to attend in the Tarago Van;

(g)the Offender's presence at the Compound on 3 July 2010, with other members, when discussions took place about the death of Kesley Burgess and the introduction of Unasa as a new recruit, together with discussions of further jobs.

Form 1 Offence - Accessory After the Fact to the Armed Robbery of Maxine Rogers 

Count 5 - Accessory After the Fact to the Armed Robbery of Tracey Burgess at a Time When Grievous Bodily Harm was Inflicted on Kesley Burgess

94The acts of the Offender relied upon with respect to these offences are as follows:

(a)the Offender attended to the injury of Natuba;

(b)the Offender cleaned three of the meat cleavers, being the weapons used in both robberies;

(c)the Offender assisted the cleaning up of Khoury's shop;

(d)the Offender was present and offered support when the stolen property from both robberies was examined and divided up;

(e)the Offender took part in calls to those who took Natuba to Bankstown Hospital, so that members of the group were kept up to date as to what was happening.

95The Offender had full knowledge, from admissions made in his presence by Natuba and Byquar, as to who was responsible for the offences and he was party to efforts to ensure that offenders left the shop to avoid detection. 

96This assistance was provided at a time prior to the death of Kesley Burgess and, accordingly, it occurred at a time when the Offender was aware that Kesley Burgess had suffered grievous bodily harm.

Count 7 - Possession of an Offensive Weapon, Whilst in Company, to Cause Grievous Bodily Harm with Intent to do Grievous Bodily Harm

Count 8 - Possession of a Prohibited Firearm

97Telephone intercepts and other evidence established that, on 3 and 4 July 2010:

(a)the Offender was aware that Byquar had requested weapons to be brought to Miller, for the purpose of inflicting grievous bodily harm on a person or persons;

(b)the Offender was aware that the request was a result of some conflict involving Unasa, a potential new recruit to the United Brotherhood;

(c)the Offender agreed to pick up Karimi, and a firearm and another weapon, from Khoury's premises at the Compound;

(d)the Offender, together with Vergara, picked up Karimi, the weapons and then Tamapua to take them to Miller;

(e)the Offender knew that the three persons he was driving to Miller, in the Ford Laser, were going to engage in a confrontation to assist Byquar and Unasa in inflicting grievous bodily harm to a person or persons;

(f)the Offender was aware that the firearm was located in the vehicle;

(g)the Offender was not authorised to possess such a firearm.

Victim Impact Statement

98Tracey Burgess made a written victim impact statement which was tendered on sentence. Her statement is relevant to sentence with respect to Count 5.

99In earlier remarks on sentence with respect to other offenders, I have referred to the impact upon Tracey Burgess of the criminal events of 1 July 2010: R v Karimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No. 11) at [219]-[231].

100In the context of the sentencing of the present Offender, I take into account that Tracey Burgess was a direct victim of the armed robbery offence, in relation to which the Offender was an accessory after the fact in Count 5. The events of that night, including the armed robbery of Tracey Burgess, have had a devastating effect upon her. 

101In addition to the victim impact statement, a report dated 19 September 2012 of Dr Sidney Lo stated that, as a result of the events of 1 July 2010, Tracey Burgess experiences a high degree of stress, which has had a detrimental effect upon her physical health in a number of ways.

102I have taken into account on sentence for Count 5 the effects of the armed robbery offence upon Tracey Burgess. 

Subjective Circumstances of the Offender

103The Offender was born in February 1990 and was 20 years old at the time of the offences. He is now 23 years old. 

104The Offender has a criminal history. In June 2006, he was placed on a good behaviour bond in the Children's Court for common assault. In January 2007, he was placed on a further good behaviour bond in the Children's Court for possession of an unregistered firearm. In June 2009, he appeared before the Liverpool Local Court, with respect to charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and contravene a domestic apprehended violence order, and was sentenced by way of a 12-month good behaviour bond, subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and to obey all reasonable directions of that Service, including accepting the guidance of a psychiatrist or psychologist. 

105It will be observed that the 12-month good behaviour bond granted on 25 June 2009 remained current for part of the period encompassed by Count 1.

106In addition, the Offender was on conditional bail at the time of the commission of all offences for which he is to be sentenced. This bail related to the matters in relation to which issues arose concerning his fitness to be tried in the District Court in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Those matters are listed for trial in the District Court in March 2014. They involve allegations of serious domestic violence against his then partner.

107No oral evidence was given at the sentencing hearing. Counsel for the Offender tendered a report dated 13 November 2013 of Dr Adam Martin, forensic psychiatrist. In addition, the determination dated 28 February 2013 of the Tribunal was also tendered in the defence case. Finally, a letter from the Offender's mother was tendered on sentence. 

108The documentary evidence reveals that the Offender was born in New Zealand, the middle of five children and moved to Australia with his family when he was 12 years old. He is of Maori heritage.

109The Offender was raised in a stable home, with his father being a hard-working man engaged as a truck driver and his mother always working, currently as a cleaner.

110The statement of the Offender's mother, and the psychiatric material in evidence, indicates that the Offender was sexually abused by a family friend at about the age of 14 years, with that person subsequently being charged and imprisoned. Thereafter, the Offender demonstrated behavioural and other problems, including excessive consumption of alcohol. 

111The Offender had been in a relationship in 2009 of which there was a young child. He and his partner separated, and events occurred in December 2009 involving that partner, giving rise to the pending charges in the District Court. 

112The Offender has a history of admissions to psychiatric units at Liverpool and Campbelltown Hospitals, having first being admitted at the age of 18 years when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

113Dr Martin examined the Offender and has prepared a number of reports since July 2011 concerning fitness issues. Dr Martin's report of 13 November 2013 confirms his earlier diagnosis of schizophrenia. 

114Dr Martin last assessed the Offender in September 2013, when he was continuing to experience psychotic symptoms and was being prescribed antipsychotic medication. Dr Martin noted that, prior to the Offender entering custody in July 2010, there was clinical documentation describing his reports of psychotic experiences similar to what was described in assessments conducted by treating psychiatrists in prison. There are documented episodes of highly disturbed behaviour in the community, including deliberate self-harm, suicide attempts and impulsive acts.

115Dr Martin is of the opinion that the Offender's mental illness, whilst not directly related to the offending in a causative way, would more likely than not have had a significant detrimental impact on his judgment or ability to make sensible decisions, and impaired his capacity to consider adverse consequences of his actions. Dr Martin considered the Offender to be a person who has a tendency to poor planning, with poor planning and poor scope for coping abilities, as a direct result of his mental illness.

116Dr Martin stated that, whilst in custody, the Offender will need to see Justice Health mental health clinicians, as he has done up to this time. In addition, Dr Martin observed, with respect to the Offender's future conditional liberty, that there is a higher risk of ""patchy medication compliance"" and subsequent worsening of his mental state, so that ongoing treatment and support from mental health clinicians will potentially ameliorate some of the risk of criminal recidivism. In addition, Dr Martin considered that the Offender will require intensive social support in the community when released.

117The Offender's mother has visited him regularly since he has been in custody, and has observed a very noticeable improvement since he was transferred to Parklea Correctional Centre. 

118It seems clear that there will be a family support network available to the Offender when the time comes for his release.
 
Sentences Imposed Upon Related Offenders

119In sentencing the present Offender, I will have regard to the principles of parity and proportionality of sentence, to the extent that they are applicable. However, considerable caution must be exercised in considering these factors in this case. 

120Firstly, no other offender has been sentenced for the offence contained in Count 1.

121Secondly, with respect to Count 5, only two other offenders, Walsh and Vergara, were sentenced in the District Court for offences of accessory after the fact for criminal offences committed in the Burgess house. Other offenders were sentenced for the murder of Kesley Burgess and the armed robbery of Tracey Burgess. 

122I accept the Crown submission that the sentences imposed in the District Court upon Walsh and Vergara are of little assistance in sentencing the present Offender on Count 5. Quite apart from the different roles of Walsh and Vergara to that of the Offender, both Walsh and Vergara had no prior convictions. In addition, Vergara's offence of accessory after the fact carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.

123Thirdly, with respect to Counts 7 and 8, there are also significant points of distinction between the Offender and others sentenced for offences arising out of this conduct. Tamapua's offence under s.33B(2) Crimes Act 1900 (the comparative charge to the Offender's Count 7) involved an intention to commit affray, a clearly lesser offence than the Offender's intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Vergara's offence was in the same terms as the Offender's Count 7. However, that sentence formed one of a number of sentences, with totality serving to explain a low sentence for Vergara on Count 7, in circumstances where his major sentence related to the machete attack upon James Stiff. Further, Vergara had no prior criminal history. Not only did the Offender have a prior criminal history, but his offences were committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty. I accept the Crown submission that Vergara's sentence is of little assistance in sentencing the present Offender.

124With respect to Count 8, Walsh, Vergara and Tamapua were each sentenced for this offence, as were Khoury and Karimi. The sentences imposed upon Vergara, Tamapua, Khoury and Karimi are of relevance to the sentencing or the present Offender. That said, the sentences imposed upon Tamapua, Khoury and Karimi were influenced significantly by the consideration of totality, as indeed was the sentence imposed upon Vergara. Further, Tamapua received a 50% discount for his pleas of guilty and assistance, and Vergara received a 25% discount for his pleas of guilty.

125A number of the limitations referred to in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at 589 [203] have direct application in these circumstances. The differences which I have recited point to a number of significant practical difficulties in comparing sentences previously imposed, with those to be passed on the Offender: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 473-474 [30].

126With these very significant qualifications, I have nevertheless kept in mind issues of parity and proportionality of sentence for the purpose of sentencing the present Offender.

The Offender's Mental Condition

127I have set out earlier Dr Martin's opinion concerning the Offender's mental condition at various times, as well as material drawn from the February 2013 Determination of the Tribunal. 

128It is clear that the Offender had been diagnosed with schizophrenia prior to the commission of the present offences. Sentencing orders made by Courts in 2009 took into account these factors. The 2009 offences involved incidents of domestic violence. 

129When interviewed by police following his arrest on 4 July 2010, the Offender indicated that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was on medication. 

130It is the case that the Offender, in the five-week period encompassed by the charges for which he is to be sentenced, had been an active member of a criminal group engaged in very serious crime. He played a significant role in that criminal group as a senior assistant to Khoury. His criminal activity was multifaceted. Clearly, the Offender was motivated by financial gain.

131In addition to the conduct giving rise to Count 1, the Offender committed specific offences as contained in Counts 5, 7 and 8, and the Form 1 offence to be taken into account on sentence for Count 5. These offences involved the Offender, whilst fully aware that serious crimes had been committed, continuing his active involvement in crime.

132The events giving rise to Counts 7 and 8 involve his willing participation in a type of call to arms, on behalf of the criminal group, to assist Byquar at Miller, with the Offender himself driving the vehicle containing his three associates from Claymore to Miller. 

133Although the Offender suffered from a diagnosed mental illness at that time, he was able to function in the various ways giving rise to the crimes for which he is to be sentenced. Dr Martin does not suggest, for understandable reasons, that there was a causal link between the Offender's mental condition and his offences. The impact of the mental condition is said to have borne upon his ability to make sensible decisions, with an impaired capacity to consider adverse consequences.

134Counsel for the Offender made submissions by reference to the well-known principles in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]-[178]. I will, in turn, refer to each of these aspects. 

135Although the Offender's mental condition impacted to some extent upon his ability to make sensible decisions at the time of the offences, I do not consider that this warrants any significant reduction in the assessment of the Offender's moral culpability for the offences. The offences involved a course of conduct over a period of time, and not an offence or offences committed in unexpected circumstances where a type of flawed judgment may have greater operation. 

136In reality, the Offender was part of an organised crime group for a period of five weeks, with his involvement ceasing only because he was arrested by police, when almost at the point where a very violent crime would take place with him as an active and intentional participant. 

137Counsel for the Offender submitted that the Offender's mental condition is such that he is in an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. I take into account the Offender's mental condition in assessing the role of general deterrence on sentence in his case. However, he was a senior participant in an organised crime group over a period of time. His moral culpability is very significant. There is an important role for general deterrence to play in a case such as this, even allowing for some modification because of the Offender's mental condition. The role of general deterrence in warning others of the consequences of involvement in gang crime remains significant in this case.

138It was submitted for the Offender that his mental condition was such that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily on him because of his mental condition. The evidence reveals that the Offender is receiving what appears to be effective treatment whilst he is in custody, at least in his present location. His mother has expressed a favourable view concerning his current state. I am not satisfied, on the evidence, that imprisonment under the sentences which I will impose will render his custodial experiences more onerous than for other persons. 

139I am satisfied that specific deterrence remains an important consideration in sentencing the Offender, notwithstanding his mental condition. The present offences were committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty, and involved a very significant escalation in the form of criminality in which he was engaged. As I have already noted, the present offences were committed over a period of weeks, and involved the Offender's preparedness to be a senior figure in organised criminal activity.

140Finally, the Offender's mental condition does raise for consideration the countervailing factor of risk of reoffending and future dangerousness. I have already noted Dr Martin's concern with respect to recidivism, and the need for a structured program in the Offender's case. If the Offender complies strictly with his medication regime and other controls which would be put in place in the community, then the risk of recidivism will be reduced. 

141However, the Offender was subject to conditional liberty, including the requirement to comply with psychiatric treatment, at the time when he committed the present offences. Those controls did not succeed in placing a brake upon the Offender, with his criminal conduct escalating in the offences for which he is to be sentenced.

142A guarded approach is required on the question of assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and the risk of reoffending.
 
Accumulation and Concurrency of Sentences

143Counsel for the Offender submitted that the sentences for Counts 7 and 8 should be served concurrently, since the criminality of Count 7 exceeds that of Count 8 and the elements of Count 8 are almost wholly to be found within Count 7. 

144The Crown agreed with the submission that it was open to the Court to impose concurrent sentences for Counts 7 and 8.

145I am satisfied that I should adopt this course on sentence for those counts.

146It was conceded for the Offender that partial accumulation was required as between Counts 1, 5 and 7. The Crown submitted that at least partial accumulation as between those counts was appropriate.

147I will take this course in sentencing for these offences.

Determining the Appropriate Sentences

148I have referred to a range of objective and subjective factors to be considered on sentence. It is necessary now to undertake the process of instinctive synthesis for the purpose of passing sentence. In doing so, I will refer to some further principles which apply to the crimes for which the Offender is to be sentenced.

149I am satisfied that each of these offences was of substantial objective gravity. 

150The moral culpability of the Offender with respect to Count 1 is high. He was a senior member of the criminal group, which was active for a number of weeks with the aim of financial profit from the sale of drugs and the use of force to bring about that result. His involvement only ceased with his arrest on 4 July 2010.

151Within the graded hierarchy of offences in s.93T Crimes Act 1900, the Offender has pleaded guilty to, and is to be sentenced for, the basic offence under s.93T(1) involving participation. However, he was a persistent participant who maintained his involvement with the criminal group after 2 July 2010, despite his actual knowledge of the violence perpetrated upon victims in home invasions. The offences now contained in s.93T were introduced in recognition of the fact that crimes committed by gangs, whether they be crimes of violence, armed robberies or drug supply offences, are ""a far greater threat to the safety and wellbeing of the community than most crimes committed by individuals acting alone"" (Second Reading Speech, Crimes Legislation Amendment (Gangs) Bill 2006, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 30 August 2006). The circumstances of this case represent a vivid example of the mischief which s.93T was intended to address.

152In passing sentence, I have kept in mind the need not to double count conduct in assessing an appropriate sentence for the general offence contained in Count 1, and the specific offences contained in Counts 5, 7 and 8, and the Form 1 offence to be taken into account on sentence on Count 5.

153In relation to Count 5, I am satisfied that there is a high degree of criminality involved in this offence. The Courts have recognised a wide variation in moral culpability of persons charged as an accessory after the fact to serious crimes: R v Farroukh (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 29 March 1996, unreported). An important aspect of being an accessory after the fact to any offence is that the offender stands between criminals and the law: R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944 at [40]. In R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104, Buddin J said at [16]:

""Clearly the community has an interest in ensuring that offenders who have committed serious crimes be brought to account. Accordingly, endeavours made by those who seek to assist such offenders from avoiding detection must be strongly resisted and visited with appropriate penalties. In those circumstances, the nature of the assistance which is provided, the extent to which it assists the principal offender in avoiding detection and the reasons why the assistance was extended, are all factors which are relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion.""

154In this case, I am satisfied that the Offender was personally involved in the criminal enterprise giving rise to the grave offences committed in the Burgess household, but his involvement fell short of participation as a principal. By the time the offence contained in Count 5 was committed, the Offender was aware of what had happened to James Stiff two days earlier. Of course, the acts constituting the offence in Count 5 involved the Offender being aware that another violent attack had been perpetrated upon a victim (Kesley Burgess) leading to very serious injuries being inflicted by the home invaders. The criminal conduct of the Offender constituting Count 5 did not come about suddenly and unexpectedly, as is sometimes the case with offences of being an accessory after the fact to a crime. The assistance provided by the Offender to the principal offenders was significant. It was not inevitable that they would be detected. But for Natuba determining to abandon his false account and assist police, it is possible that the principal offenders may not have been brought to justice.

155It is necessary to take into account, as well, the circumstances of the Form 1 offence which should operate to increase sentence on Count 5. The Offender was aware that there had been a separate home invasion on the night of 1 July 2010, fortunately not involving any physical injury to Maxine Rogers or her children, but involving the armed robbery of property.

156Counts 7 and 8 involved the Offender continuing to commit crimes with other members of the criminal group. This happened despite the fact that he was aware of the terrible injuries inflicted upon James Stiff and, by 3 July 2010, of the fact that Kesley Burgess had died as a result of the injuries sustained in the home invasion on 1 July 2010. 

157Despite this, the Offender assisted in the formation of an armed group of men whom he himself conveyed by vehicle to the intended meeting point with Byquar at Miller, with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, only to be intercepted by police. Counts 7 and 8 are very serious examples of crimes of this type. 

158In approaching sentence on Count 8, I have regard to the standard non-parole period of three years, in accordance with the amendments recently made to ss.54A and 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

159The Offender was subject to conditional liberty when all offences were committed. He has a criminal history which operates to deprive him of leniency to which he may otherwise have been entitled.

160I take into account the Offender's subjective circumstances, including his mental condition and his life experiences, which appear to have contributed to his mental difficulties.

161The Offender's prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded for reasons explained earlier in these remarks.

162A 25% discount will be applied for the Offender's pleas of guilty. 

163Having taken into account all objective and subjective factors and the purposes of sentencing stated in s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, including the need for general deterrence and specific deterrence, the sentences to be passed for each offence (before application of the 25% discount for pleas of guilty, which will involve some rounding) would be as follows:

(a)Count 1 - imprisonment for four years;

(b)Count 5 (taking into account the Form 1 offence) - imprisonment for 10 years;

(c)Count 7 - imprisonment for 10 years;

(d)Count 8 - imprisonment for six years.

164A finding of special circumstances will be made by reason of accumulation of sentences and the need for an appropriate period of parole supervision. In calculating sentences and the level of accumulation, I have had regard to factors including the Offender's youth, the fact that it is his first time in prison and his mental condition. It is not appropriate to have regard to these factors again, double counting them in the Offender's favour, as part of a finding of special circumstances. 

165The effective non-parole period must be sufficiently long to allow for an appropriate period of conditional liberty, having regard to the matters raised by Dr Martin and the Offender's background and need for supervision in the community.

166I have regard to the question of totality in determining the total effective non-parole period and head sentence. The aggregation of all sentences for the Offender is to constitute a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved: R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 164 [15]. The effective non-parole period represents the minimum period which the Offender should serve in custody for all his crimes, having regard to all the purposes of sentencing. The effective balance of term to be set will provide sufficient opportunity for conditional liberty to assist the Offender's return to the community upon release.

167Ray Tuki, will you please stand. 

168For the offence contained in Count 1, participation in a criminal group, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on 4 July 2010 and expiring on 3 October 2012, with a balance of term of nine months commencing on 4 October 2012 and expiring on 3 July 2013.

169For Count 5, the offence of accessory after the fact to the armed robbery of Tracey Burgess and at the time causing grievous bodily harm to Kesley Burgess, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years commencing on 4 July 2012 and expiring on 3 July 2017, with a balance of term of two years and six months commencing on 4 July 2017 and expiring on 3 January 2020.

170For Count 7, the offence of whilst in company, possessing an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely intentionally causing grievous bodily harm, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 4 July 2014 and expiring on 3 July 2018, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 4 July 2018 and expiring on 3 July 2021. 

171For Count 8, the offence of possession of a prohibited firearm, I sentence you to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years commencing on 4 July 2014 and expiring on 3 July 2017, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 4 July 2017 and expiring on 3 July 2018.

172You will not be eligible for release to parole until 3 July 2018.

173The total effective sentence is one comprising a non-parole period of eight years with a balance of term of three years.

174Before concluding these sentencing proceedings, I would like to make some further comments. The present Offender is the ninth and final person to be sentenced in this Court for offences arising from the activities of this criminal group in June and July 2010. Four other persons have been sentenced in the District Court for related offences, with two persons yet to be sentenced in the District Court for offences relating to the Miller incident on 4 July 2010. 

175At the conclusion of the trial of Khoury, Karimi and Mir in June 2010, I made some comments concerning the thorough and effective police investigation in this matter. It seems clear, that the use of telephone intercepts at an early stage allowed the police to intercept the vehicle heading to Miller on 4 July 2010, so as to avoid what would have otherwise been a serious violent confrontation. This action served to protect members of the community. A thorough and painstaking investigation by police led to a very substantial body of evidence called at the trial of Khoury, Karimi and Mir. The police are to be commended for the thoroughness of their investigation in this matter. 

176I note the presence of Tracey Burgess in Court, and take this final opportunity to express the condolences of the Court and the community for the great loss and suffering which she has experienced as a result of the terrible events of July 2010.

		13 December 2013",2013-12-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2762958,R v Stenberg [2013] NSWSC 1858,"Judgment
1Jonathon Stenberg today stands for sentence for the murder of Edward James Kelly, (born James Harold Engelsman and known as Ned Kelly), on 17 or 18 June 2012 at Broadwater in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales.   After a police investigation he was arrested in the Northern Territory on 1 July 2012 and later pleaded guilty on arraignment in this Court, on 6 September 2013.
This Court's task
2I will begin by explaining how the sentence imposed on the offender has been arrived at, by reference to what legislation enacted by the Parliament and binding case law requires in a sentencing exercise such as this.  
3The sentence which is imposed on the offender must reflect the gravity of his offence, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354).  It must be determined in light of the maximum penalty imposed for the crime in question.  In the case of the offence of murder, under s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 that penalty is life imprisonment. 
4Also to be considered is that s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed on an offender, only if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme, that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence.  
5The maximum sentence of life imprisonment is thus reserved for extreme offences of murder.  This was explained in R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448, where it was said at [60]:
""Because the life sentence provided by s.61 of that Act does not contemplate any prospect of relief in the future, no matter how distant, it should be reserved for crimes of the utmost heinousness: Chung [1999] NSWCCA 330, Ibbs v. R. (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-2, Twala NSWCCA 4/11/94, Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 553 at pars.344-4, Harris at 423.""

6It is a matter for the Crown to establish that an offence falls within s 61(1).  In this case while the Crown submitted that a significant sentence was called for, it did not seek the imposition of life imprisonment on this offender.  
7By s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment for an offence of murder falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence.  A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison, before being eligible to be released on parole for the balance of the sentence imposed for the offence.  
8Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are amongst the factors which must take into account on sentencing, as discussed by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 and now provided in s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
9In arriving at a sentence the Court must also bear in mind the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Those purposes are: 
""(a)  to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, (b)  to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, (c)  to protect the community from the offender, (d)  to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, (e)  to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, (f)  to denounce the conduct of the offender, (g)  to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 

10Under s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a plea of guilty must be taken into account in determining sentence.  Under s 21A of that Act the Court is also required to give consideration to identified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence.  Consideration must also be given to questions of general and specific deterrence.  
11The sentence imposed must finally ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]). 
12On sentencing regard must also be paid to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed on an offender must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period imposed, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances which warrant a departure from that ratio.  
13If there is to be any such adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve for the offence he has committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628).
The Evidence 
14In this case the parties agreed on the facts by way of a document entitled 'Crown Facts', which was added to by agreement at the hearing.  The Crown also tendered various photographs, the offender's limited criminal history, as well as an autopsy report and a report of Professor David M Greenberg, a forensic psychiatrist, who examined the offender on 13 May 2013 and 1 June 2013.
15The offender did not give evidence.  He tendered a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, also a forensic psychiatrist, who first examined him on 20 July 2012, about a month after the offence and again on 22 January 2013.  It was the common view of Professor Greenberg and Dr Nielssen that the offender suffers from a mental condition, but they were not entirely agreed as to what it was, or what its impact was.
The parties' cases
16By his plea the offender accepted that he is guilty of Mr Kelly's murder.
17The Crown's case was that this was a very serious example of the offence of murder, falling above the mid-range of seriousness of such offences.  It submitted that the offence was unusual and brutal, being premeditated, the offender having taken a loaded gun to Mr Kelly's home at night, shooting Mr Kelly in the head, intending to kill him.  The offender later decapitated Mr Kelly and attempted to set alight his home, in an effort to destroy evidence and then disposed of Mr Kelly's head, which has never been found.  These acts were submitted to be significant aggravating factors necessary to be reflected in the sentence imposed.
18The Crown also submitted that the offender's use of alcohol prior to the murder did not mitigate the seriousness of his offence, particularly given that he clearly retained the ability not only to set about destroying evidence, but also the clarity of thought to open a birdcage and release a bird, so that it would not be burnt.
19The Crown relied on Professor Greenberg's opinion that the offender had a history of depression and anxiety and that at the time of his offence that he was under personal stress in relation to his finances and lack of employment, and was suffering from depression and anxiety.  Those conditions were submitted to have been neither severe nor debilitating and thus while relevant as mitigating matters on sentencing, could not be given much weight in the sentencing exercise.  This was in dispute.
20The offender accepted that his offence was objectively serious, submitting that it was not necessary to determine where in the range it fell, but accepting that it fell slightly above the mid-range of seriousness.  Contrary to the Crown's submission, he argued that it would be accepted that his mental condition had contributed to his offence to a material degree, making it inappropriate for considerations of general or specific deterrence to feature in the sentence imposed upon him.  He also submitted that various other mitigating matters would be taken into account, some of which were in dispute, particularly in relation to the questions of planning and premeditation.
21The offender relied on the opinions which both psychiatrists reached as to  his mental state, but his case also rested on conclusions which Dr Nielssen had reached.  The Crown's case was that the views which Professor Greenberg had formed of the offender and the conclusions he had reached, would be preferred.  Neither psychiatrist was called for cross-examination.
22Given the issues lying between the parties, in this case it is necessary to have regard to what the law provides in relation to the onus of proof and the standard of proof which fall on the respective parties in a sentencing exercise such as this.  In GAS v R; SJK v R [2004] HCA 22; (2004) 217 CLR 198 at [30], five members of the High Court said of fact finding following a plea of guilty: 
""In the case of a plea of guilty, any facts beyond what is necessarily involved as an element of the offence must be proved by evidence, or admitted formally (as in an agreed statement of facts), or informally (as occurred in the present case by a statement of facts from the bar table which was not contradicted). There may be significant limitations as to a judge's capacity to find potentially relevant facts in a given case."" 

23In The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 the majority judges explained (at [24]) as to onus that:
""References to onus of proof in the context of sentencing would mislead if they were understood as suggesting that some general issue is joined between prosecution and offender in sentencing proceedings; there is no such joinder of issue. Nonetheless, it may be accepted that if the prosecution seeks to have the sentencing judge take a matter into account in passing sentence it will be for the prosecution to bring that matter to the attention of the judge and, if necessary, call evidence about it. Similarly, it will be for the offender who seeks to bring a matter to the attention of the judge to do so and, again, if necessary, call evidence about it. (We say 'if necessary' because the calling of evidence would be required only if the asserted fact was controverted or if the judge was not prepared to act on the assertion.).""

24The majority said as to standard of proof at [27]:
 ""... we would adopt what was said by the majority in R v Storey ([1998] 1 VR 359 at 369 per Winneke P, Brooking and Hayne JJA and Southwell AJA) - that a sentencing judge 
'may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities.' 

25The rules of evidence do not ordinarily apply at a sentencing hearing (see s 4 of the Evidence Act 1995), but nevertheless, the weight of the evidence which the parties lead must be critically assessed. 
26Hearsay evidence of statements made by offenders to doctors, psychologists or psychiatrists in reports are admissible on sentencing, but very considerable caution has to be exercised in relying on such statements, if they concern matters in dispute, when the offender does not give evidence and thus cannot be cross-examined on those statements (see for example R v Harrison [2001] NSWCCA 79 at [32]; (2001) 121 A Crim R 380; R v Hooper [2004] NSWCCA 10 at [49]; Munro v R [2006] NSWCCA 350 at [17] - [19]; Woodgate v R (2009) 195 A Crim R 219 at [19]; Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 at [18].) 
27If such material is sought to be relied on to minimise the objective seriousness of a crime otherwise apparent on the evidence, particular caution must be exercised.  In R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369, Smart AJ observed at [59] that ""In many cases only very limited weight can be given to such statements"".  Spigelman CJ agreed, observing at [79]:
""I agree with the observations of Smart AJ as to the limited weight that ought to be given to self-serving, untested statements made to experts which are tendered in sentencing hearings.""

28The issues lying between the parties must be resolved in the light of these binding authorities.
The nature and seriousness of this offence
29There was no significant issue between the parties as to the objective seriousness of this offence.  It is plainly a very serious example of murder, involving as it did the execution of a victim, late at night in his own home, by a single gunshot to the head and the subsequent decapitation and attempted destruction of evidence, including the body, by burning.  
30The absence of any defensive wounds and what was found on autopsy is, however, consistent with a quicker, rather than a painfully lingering death.  That, no doubt, explains why it was that the Crown submitted that this was not a case warranting a sentence of life imprisonment, which the Parliament has reserved for the very worst of offences of murder.  On the evidence, I am satisfied that this submission must be accepted.
31The agreed facts reveal that the offender and Mr Kelly had owned adjoining properties since 2008 and that there had been a history of conflict between them.  In September 2009 the offender was charged with assaulting Mr Kelly, both he and Mr Kelly alleging that the other had assaulted him.  The charge was withdrawn in October 2009 in the Ballina Local Court.
32At about 10.30am on Sunday, 17 June 2012 the offender was cutting down a tree on his property with a chainsaw, with the help of another neighbour, Gregory Ellis.  A heated argument broke out near the fence between the properties between the offender and Mr Kelly, during which Mr Ellis heard the offender say to Mr Kelly words to the effect 'I am going to fuck you up your arsehole'.
33Mr Kelly eventually returned to his home and the offender and Mr Ellis later consumed about five or six beers together.  The offender was worked up about Mr Kelly.  Mr Ellis asked the offender 'What was all that about', to which the offender replied 'He's been a fuck wit, telling me that I can't cut down a tree on my own property'.  He also told Mr Ellis that he was going to kill Mr Kelly and then went to his shed and returned with a silver coloured pistol and a magazine, which he showed Mr Ellis.  
34When the offender formed the intention to kill Mr Kelly was in issue between the parties.  The Crown relies on this evidence to submit that it was at this time that the intention which the offender later acted on was formed.  On the offender's case he formed an intention to kill Mr Kelly only just before he shot him later that night.
35Mr Ellis left the property at about 3pm. At about 4pm the offender went to the Broadwater Hotel where he began drinking.  He also bought a carton of beer.  He there spoke to William Degotardi, who he told, amongst other things, that he used to be in the military.  The offender went to his car and returned with a silver handgun and a magazine.  He then told Mr Degotardi that he was with the Australian Federal Police, that he was looking for Ned Kelly, who was involved in growing marijuana and paedophilia at Evans Head.  Mr Degotardi told the offender that he knew Mr Kelly and thought that he had made a mistake.  The offender warned Mr Degotardi to stay away.  Mr Degotardi left the hotel a short while later, but reported his concerns to friends over following days.
36It was submitted for the offender that what he told Mr Degotardi was somewhat bizarre.  On Professor Greenberg's report, however, the offender is no stranger to telling such untruths.  He had served in the military for only two years, but in the past had told others, treating doctors, for example, that  he had served for up to six years, including overseas; that he had been shot at; and that he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder, even though he had never been diagnosed with such an illness.  To Professor Greenberg he denied having symptoms of such a disorder.  
37The offender told Professor Greenberg that he told such untruths because he was ""sick"" and ""hasn't been well for a long time"".  He then claimed to be having an anxiety attack, saying that his life was ""in a mess"".  This evidence underscores the caution with which the various accounts which the offender has given must be approached.  
38There is no issue that the offender shot Mr Kelly during the night of 17 to 18 June.  The agreed facts give no account of what he then did.  
39At about 3am on 18 June the offender's wife was woken by the offender at their home at Greenslopes in Queensland.  She asked him why he was home so late.  He told her that 'I got pissed off and shot our neighbour'.  She asked 'Who?', he replied 'Ned'. She told him not to tell her any more as he was scaring her.  He told her that he needed to go away and get some money from the bank.  He then went to sleep and she went to work at 4.30am.  On her return home that afternoon she found a note indicating that the offender had gone away.  Later he contacted her with a new mobile number.  He told her not to tell anyone about anything.
40That day the offender withdrew $10,000 cash from his bank account and made plans to flee Queensland.  He returned to his property at Broadwater with a friend, in order to collect some belongings.  He later left a pistol at her premises at Tingalpa in Queensland, where he replaced the number plates of his vehicle.  He then travelled to the Northern Territory.
41On the afternoon of 21 June at about 4.30pm Mr Kelly's body was found at his home by a friend, who had not seen him since 17 June and had become worried as to his whereabouts.  He forced entry through the back door and found Mr Kelly, lying on his back on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood.  On police examination it was discovered that Mr Kelly had been decapitated and that an Akubra hat had been positioned on top of his torso, covering his neck wound.  Two blood stained knives were nearby, one stabbed into the floor in an upright position.  Mr Kelly had no apparent defensive wounds and blood stains indicated that he had been decapitated where he lay.  
42There had also been an unsuccessful attempt made to set fire to the premises.  There was a crude fuse placed on top of the hat.  It was constructed of a lit cigarette and a number of long matches bound together with a copper coil.  There was an amount of ignitable fluid on the floor around Mr Kelly.  The electric stovetop element was on and there were remnants of a burnt glove on the element.  There was also a cigarette lighter on the floor.  There were also a number of shoe impressions located as well as a spent cartridge.  The offender's DNA profile was later matched to the matches and cigarette found at the scene, as well as with samples taken from Mr Kelly's clothing. 
43On 25 June police established that the offender was in the Northern Territory and a police operation began there.  That day, during a police search at the Greenslopes property, a large amount of ammunition and a press for manufacturing ammunition were seized.  A search of the Broadwater property located long matches similar to those used to make the crude fuse in the shed.  Boot impressions similar to those located inside the victim's home were found outside the shed.  A search of the Tingalpa property located the silver pistol 
44That day the offender sent an email to his wife, which said:
""The idiot said he was gonna rape u next time he saw u that just set me off sorry love you so much be strong and tell the coppers nothing as thats the lawers(sic) job not yours.""

45On 1 July 2012 the offender was arrested in a 'hide' located in thick shrub about 50km south of Darwin.  He was then in possession of long arms and a 9mm Glock pistol.  He was then extradited and charged.
46Mr Kelly's head has never been found.  The cause of his death could not be determined on autopsy.  Features then identified indicated that his head had been removed some hours after his death.  There was a smell of accelerant on his body, as well as chemical burns caused by accelerant.  The offender later told Dr Nielssen that he had thrown Mr Kelly's head into a river.
47On 17 April 2013, after examination by Dr Nielssen, the offender offered to enter a plea to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment and agreed to a psychiatric assessment.  Professor Greenberg's report was dated 23 June.  The offender entered a plea to the charge of murder on arraignment in September 2013.
The accounts which the offender later gave
48While the experts agreed that the offender suffered from a depressive illness, they disagreed as to its nature and the degree to which it contributed to his offence.  They both had access to largely the same material and Professor Greenberg also had Dr Nielssen's report. Their opinions also rested on the histories which the offender gave each of them.  A comparison of their reports shows that those histories were inconsistent in a number of relevant respects both from each other and from the later agreed facts.
49Apart from what he told his wife the night that he shot Mr Kelly, on the evidence, the offender has only given a coherent account of what he did to Dr Nielssen, who first examined him in July 2012 and again in January 2013.  He told Dr Nielssen that he was a completely different person since receiving treatment; that he acknowledged that he had caused Mr Kelly's death, for which he said he was remorseful; and that he intended to plead not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. 
50The offender did not appear to have such clarity of thought when later examined by Professor Greenberg, who he told that he did not have a good memory of what had happened and to whom he gave quite a different account of various relevant matters.  Professor Greenberg had real reservations as to the offender's accounts, for good reason, it appears.
51Amongst other things, the offender told Dr Nielssen that he met Mr Kelly after he purchased the property at Broadwater, where he initially lived in a tent, before erecting a shed, where he began to stay more often.  He then began to see Mr Kelly, who jumped over the fence and became a bit of a nuisance, inviting himself over, never bringing a beer and impeding his enjoyment of the place.
52Their conflict in 2009 began when Mr Kelly turned up while he was having a beer with Mr Ellis and became annoyed when he wasn't given another.  Mr Kelly made a provocative reference to homosexuality and put his arm around the offender and said 'don't knock it until you tried it'.  The offender pushed him away and Mr Kelly picked up a stick and swung it at him, leaving him with an abrasion and bruising.  The offender rang the police who later charged him with assault, although the charges were later dropped.  Since then there had been open hostility between he and Mr Kelly.
53He said that on the morning he killed Mr Kelly he had been woken by a bang on the shed, which he assumed was caused by Mr Kelly.  Later, when he was cutting down the tree with Mr Ellis, Mr Kelly popped up out of the blue and told him that he needed council approval and goaded him with abuse, including a remark that he found his wife attractive, which the offender said was 'the last straw'.
54The offender told Dr Nielssen that he later had several beers with Mr Ellis and after Mr Ellis left, he kept drinking, consuming about a carton of beer and between a quarter and half a bottle of rum over a period of several hours.  
55The offender said that he had been in a depressed state of mind for about six years, the major cause of which was the loss of $250,000 on a property development venture.  He and his wife were some $660,000 in debt and were facing bankruptcy.  He was irritable, easily frustrated and depressed before seeking treatment.  He was then being treated with antidepressants and had gone to the shed to get away.  
56The offender also said that about a year before, he had begun experiencing hallucinations of a voice, which he thought was his father's.  It got bad that night and got him into a pretty worked up state, which he described as like being in a movie, like watching himself.  
57He said that he heard a voice say 'go and sort him out'.  He had never been to Mr Kelly's home before, but went to his kitchen door, where Mr Kelly 'popped up with a knife' and then he shot him.  They had no conversation.  He had not wanted to shoot Mr Kelly, but had his finger on the trigger and shot him once in the head.  The voice said 'take it off' and he used a knife to cut off his head, he said 'don't ask me why'.  
58He got rid of the head in the river.  When asked why he had not got rid of the body as well, the offender said that:""I put a hat over the wound ... I just felt appalled at what I did ... I couldn't make much sense of it ...I have great remorse and regret for Ned even though we didn't get on ... I was on automatic ... I felt I couldn't stop myself even if I wanted to.""  

59When asked about his memory of the events he said:
""I was balancing different emotions...freedom and the reality would hit in succession.""

60A number of things need to be observed about this account.  The first, that it does not accord with what the autopsy report established, namely, that Mr Kelly's head was decapitated hours after he was shot.  The second, that it does not accord with aspects of the agreed facts, particularly as to the other calculated steps which the offender took in an attempt to conceal his crime.  Thirdly, that it does not accord with what the offender told his wife not long afterwards, namely, that he had killed Mr Kelly because he was 'pissed off' with him.  Fourthly, it does not accord in relevant respects with what he later told Professor Greenberg.  
61Dr Nielssen's report as to the offender's mental state was:
""At the initial interview Mr Stenberg presented as a short strongly built man who had an anxious manner and appeared quite depressed. He was suspicious and early in the interview asked to examine some proof of identity. He appeared quite distractedand had difficulty completing sentences and retrieving information in a way that appeared to be due to the disorganisation of thinking associated with mental illness. He described typical symptoms of schizophrenia and the persecutory belief that he had been in danger prior to his arrest in response to those symptoms.
...
Mr Stenberg's mental state had improved by the time of the recent interview. He did not appear as anxious and depressed. He was polite and addressed me as ""sir"", in a way that perhaps reflected his background in the Army. His speech was normal in form. He reported experiencing hallucinations of voices in the past, but recognised them to be hallucinations and said that they had resolved with treatment. No delusional beliefs were elicited. He was correctly oriented, was able to provide a detailed history and his intelligence was estimated to be about average from his vocabulary, literacy and occupational and educational attainment.""

62Dr Nielssen concluded amongst other things:
""The diagnosis of probable psychotic illness is based on Mr Stenberg's account of typical symptoms of schizophrenia-like psychosis and aspects of his presentation during the initial interview, when he seemed quite suspicious and to have disorganised thinking in a way that was consistent with active mental illness.
...
Based on the history from Mr Stenberg, and the information from the various medical records, his illness is probably a form of psychotic depression, as he reported hallucinations of voices that he recognised to be hallucinations, which appeared to be associated with the experience of depressed mood and werereported to be worse when he was in a distressed state. Mr Stenberg did not report holding any delusional belief regarding Mr Kelly, for example, that Mr Kelly posed an immediate threat to him, or any delusional belief regarding the source of hallucinated voices. He reported being intoxicated with a large quantity of alcohol consumed on the day of the offence, and that his behaviour was influenced by hallucinations of voices he experienced around the time of the offence, which may leave open a defence of mental illness to the charge of murder.""

63Dr Nielssen's opinion was that the offender had a probable psychotic illness, which was in remission and that he suffered from a depressive illness, alcohol abuse disorder and a possible underlying learning disorder.
64Professor Greenberg received a somewhat different account from the offender.  His opinion was that he was suffering depression; alcohol abuse/dependence; steroid abuse in remission and learning disorder in childhood.  While the offender did not have a mental illness he thought there were possible mitigating matters relevant to sentencing namely that of substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind. 
65The offender had told Professor Greenberg that Mr Kelly had approached when they were cutting down the tree and abused him, telling him he 'should not be cutting down his trees'.  He said 'I got irate with him telling me what to do on my property'.  Mr Kelly had threatened him, by saying 'you'd better not let your wife (come) down on her own.'  Mr Ellis told him that Mr Kelly had assaulted a girl in the past and he then told Mr Ellis that he had a gun.
66The offender said that he was angry and his mental state was not good.  He was verbally aggressive towards Mr Kelly and told him to mind his business.  Mr Kelly abused him and then retreated into his property.  
67As to his alcohol consumption the offender said that he and Mr Ellis then drank eight stubbies and he had also drunk three Vodkas.  He was unhappy and fed up with Mr Kelly, for trying to tell him what to do.  He could not clearly recall going to the pub, but he remembered buying a carton of beer and drank some before he went to sleep.  He then felt life was kicking him around and he felt drained.
68He was woken by a bang on the side of the shed and heard voices outside.  It was dark.  He was sure it was Mr Kelly who had kicked the shed.  He heard a voice say 'What are you going to do about him hitting my property?'  He then got out of bed to chase Mr Kelly.
69He said that he had a pistol on him, because he always slept with a pistol under his pillow.  He had been paranoid for 17 months before the shooting.  He went outside, but claimed he had no recall of going to Mr Kelly's home.  He reported only having  'bits of memory'.  He recalled Mr Kelly being on the ground in his kitchen.  He had never been there before and said that he had no recall of the shooting.  He did recall hearing the discharge of a firearm.  He thought that Mr Kelly was going to get his shotgun.
70The offender recalled no conversation, but remembered feeling 'anger, really angry' about Mr Kelly and other things.  He felt like he was in a movie.  His body was doing 'this stuff' and he was aware of what was going on and what he had done.  He felt shock and sick inside his head, which was pounding.  He went back to his shed and drove to Brisbane.
71The offender could not recall any further information.  When asked why he had decapitated Mr Kelly, he said he was just 'angry upset and confused'.  When asked where he had disposed of the head, he had no recall.  He also had no recall of putting accelerant on Mr Kelly's body, leaving the stove on, or manufacturing the fuse left on the hat.  When asked why he had left the hat on the body, he said 'I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.  I was upset and the medication didn't help at that time'. 
72When further questioned he said he had no recall of what had happened.  When asked why he had shot Mr Kelly he said 'cause I didn't want to get shot by a shotgun.  He was on my property first.  I thought he would shoot me'.  He also said that he was intoxicated and had taken antidepressant medication and one Xanax.  
73The offender said that he told his wife on his return home that he had 'trouble on the block'.  He arranged to go to the Northern Territory next day.  At the time 'he kind of knew what I've done'.  He said he was 'pretty fucked up' and the whole thing 'seems like a blur'.  He claimed that he had not gone to the Northern Territory to flee, but to find work.  He also said that he did not go to the police because it didn't seem like he had done anything wrong and that his mental state was not good.
74There is no explanation for this loss of memory apparent on the evidence, although it must be remembered that Dr Nielssen examined the offender when he was seeking to advance a mental illness defence and Professor Greenberg, when he was wanting to have a plea to manslaughter accepted.
75This first account given to Professor Greenberg does not accord with aspects of the account he had earlier given to Dr Nielssen; nor does it accord with what the offender told his wife when he returned home the night he killed Mr Kelly, it also does not accord with aspects of the later agreed facts; or with some of what he said in his second interview with Professor Greenberg.  
76In his second examination the offender told Professor Greenberg that he felt strange at the time of the offence.  He was drinking beer with his antidepressant medication, but he felt a lot more relaxed and friendly and not in a bad mood.  He became angry and agitated when he argued with Mr Kelly over the tree.  He did not know why Mr Kelly felt he could tell him about his job and that Mr Kelly made no effort to talk to him civilly.  Normally he would get in his truck and drive away but he was bogged down because it had been raining and he did not want to get stuck in the mud.
77The offender told Professor Greenberg that he could not then remember the murder.  He could recall a loud bang on his shed and hearing a single voice outside.  It was all 'bits and pieces'.  He was reluctant to discuss them any further.  He then claimed that he had been hearing voices inside his head telling him he was no good and not to bother or try, continuously since aged 13 years.  He did not, however, recall hearing any voices at the time of the offence.
78When asked about going to the Northern Territory he said he did not believe it had happened and was going there for work.  When asked about changing his number plates, he said he had little breaks of reality and would then drift off again.  He said that he got a new mobile because he needed a new one and his old one did not have good reception outside Brisbane.  
79When asked why he had told his wife not to tell anyone about him, he said he was not sure what was going on and wanted to 'work it out first', before he spoke to anyone.  He was trying to protect his wife.
80The offender did not reply to questions about why he had put a hat on Mr Kelly's torso.  He said he did not know why he had tried to set fire to the property.  He said that he has 'good days and bad days'.  When asked again, he accepted that he had shot Mr Kelly and said:
""I was really angry at the time.  He was coming and abusing me over the fence.  It was the last straw."" 
81When asked about Mr Kelly's threat to rape his wife, he stated that Mr Kelly had told him this over the fence and had abused him; that he 'wouldn't hear half of it' and that he had said 'don't leave your wife on the property without you being there'. 
82Professor Greenberg also reported:
""I asked Mr Stenberg what had happened to the bird in the cage of the home of Mr Kelly and he stated that he had let out the bird.  He stated that he didn't think it was fair that the bird was left in the cage.  Mr Stenberg stated he identified with the animal.  When asked why he had let the bird out the cage he stated that he didn't want the bird to get burnt.  He stated that he didn't want to see anything happen to animals""

83Again, not only did this further account depart from the earlier accounts which the offender had given both Professor Greenberg and Dr Nielssen, it, too, departed from aspects of the later agreed facts.  On this occasion, while the offender claimed to have even less memory of what he had done than before, what he said about the bird showed that he had a memory of trying to set Mr Kelly's home alight, which he was not prepared to discuss.  He was also not prepared to discuss other things which he plainly did remember.
84Professor Greenberg reported as to the offender's mental state:
""Mr Stenberg was difficult to interview. He claimed to have limited recall of the events at the time of the alleged offence or of events following the event. He was a poor historian and had difficulty expressing his feelings. He had a chin beard and was malodorous. He is a man of short stature who is mildly obese.  He had monotone speech. At times during interview when asked directquestions about the alleged offence, he became distressed and claimed that he was anxious and could not answer the question. His affect was restricted and dysphoric. At times his history was disjointed. There was no evidence of and(sic) formal thought disorder. His thought was mildly retarded in flow. There were no true auditory hallucinations or any other hallucinations such as visual, tactile or olfactory amongst others. He reported vague paranoid ideation that people were talking about him or that people did not like him. There were no overt paranoid delusions or delusions of any other nature such as grandiose or referential delusions. He denied any symptoms of disorder of thought control such as thought insertion or thought broadcasting. He tended to havepoor psychological insight into his psychological problems.""

85Professor Greenberg concluded:
""I am of the opinion that Mr Stenberg suffers from depression and anxiety.  I am of the opinion that Mr Stenberg does not suffer from a major psychiatric illness such as a Schizophrenic Disorder or other psychotic disorder. I am of the opinion that his complaints of ""voices"" relate to his depression, anxiety, and feelings of poor self-worth, poor self-esteem and his current perceived bleak circumstances with him being in custody and facing serious criminal charges of murder.""

86In my assessment it cannot be concluded from the evidence on which the offender relies that facts beyond those which have been agreed were established by the inconsistent and untested accounts which he earlier gave to Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg.  
87The offender relied on those accounts to advance various of his submissions.  I am satisfied that these untested, inconsistent accounts are unreliable and do not provide a basis upon which any conclusions favourable to the offender can readily be reached.  
88There is no evidence that Mr Ellis, who was present during the altercation on 17 June between the offender and Mr Kelly, heard Mr Kelly make any threats.   On the agreed facts when Mr Ellis asked the offender what the argument was all about later that day, he made no mention of any threat and when he woke his wife later that night, he reported no threat to her.  He also made no mention of any threat to his wife when he spoke to Dr Nielssen.  The account of a threat of rape which he later gave his wife in an email, was not repeated until Professor Greenberg asked the offender about it.  That such a threat was made has not been established.
89The offender certainly used a knife to decapitate Mr Kelly.  The evidence did not establish who the knives found near the body belonged to.  The only suggestion that they belonged to Mr Kelly came from the offender, who told Dr Nielssen that Mr Kelly came to the door armed with a knife.  He made no mention of this to Professor Greenberg, who he told instead that he feared that Mr Kelly had a shotgun and was going to shoot him.  The absence of any defensive wounds is consistent with Mr Kelly being unarmed when he was shot.  
90It follows that in assessing the nature and seriousness of this offence, these various accounts cannot be accepted as establishing that Mr Kelly threatened the offender's wife, that the offender was in any fear of Mr Kelly, or that Mr Kelly had either a knife or a shotgun when the offender came to the door and shot him in the head.  
91It follows that it must be concluded that this was objectively a very serious example of murder, as the Crown submitted.  
Alcohol use
92As discussed in R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [72] - [74] the concept that an offence was impulsive, unplanned and that an offender's capacity to exercise judgment was impaired by alcohol or other substance abuse is a narrow one.  The evidence does not establish that it was relevant here.
93It was agreed that the offender consumed alcohol on 17 June.  That such intoxication was out of character is not apparent. 
94The accounts which the offender later gave as to his alcohol use was inconsistent.  To Dr Nielssen the offender reported no treatment of any kind for substance abuse and that he was not usually a heavy drinker, but that his intake had increased before the murder because of his depression.  He also said that drinking a carton of beer and some spirits over a period of six hours was atypical.  
95The offender then reported having tried cannabis when younger, but that it made him 'really paranoid ... super hyper vigilant'.  He also reported abuse of anabolic steroids in combination with human growth hormone, but had not used any steroids for about 18 months.  He said that they made him feel confident and strong, not more aggressive or impulsive.  He reported one uncharacteristic episode of road rage, which he thought might have been an uncharacteristic response caused by the psychological effect of steroids.  He said that he had stopped their use because he realised they were bad for his health.
96The offender's report to Professor Greenberg was quite different.  Then he said that he had abused alcohol from age 17 years, to about 18 months previously.  He reported past alcoholic blackouts and morning drinking and use of sedative medication 12 years previously, to assist with alcohol withdrawals.  He claimed to have participated in an eight week drug and alcohol treatment programme while in the army, as well as membership of alcoholics anonymous.  He claimed abstinence for two years, but said that he had resumed his previous levels of alcohol consumption two months prior to the offence
97He also reported smoking cannabis three times a week from age 17, and varying consumption once a week subsequently, LSD use between 18 to 20, as well as periodic amphetamine use at age 20, the last reported use being in 2000.
98He also reported an interest in weightlifting and steroid and testosterone treatment.  In his initial interview he claimed that he had injectable testosterone treatment the week before the offence, but in the second interview claimed that he had ceased such treatment two years previously.
99That the offender was much affected by the alcohol he had consumed is not established by this evidence.
100To the contrary, on the evidence he was so unaffected that he was able to go in the dark to Mr Kelly's home, where he had never been before and to execute him with a single shot to the head.  He was then able to decapitate him cleanly; to take steps to set his home alight with a home made fuse; to free a bird so that it would not be burnt; to dispose of Mr Kelly's head and to drive back to his home in Queensland, where he reported to his wife that he had shot Mr Kelly because he was pissed off with him, as he plainly was. 
101In the result the offender's alcohol consumption can provide neither any explanation for, or mitigation of, this offence.
Aggravating factors
102The various aggravating factors specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which it was agreed by the parties were relevant to this sentencing exercise are:
""(c)   the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon,
(eb)   the offence was committed in the home of the victim""

103As the parties accepted, however, there must be no double counting of these factors, which have to be taken into account in reaching a conclusion as to the objective seriousness of this offence.  
104The offender also accepted that his offence was aggravated by the removal of Mr Kelly's head and the attempt to set fire to Mr Kelly's home.  In Richardson v R [2013] NSWCCA 218 it was explained by reference to observations made in R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 314 and Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292 that dismemberment of a victim's body and the disposal of parts of the body, although not ingredients of the crime of murder, are relevant to the overall assessment of its seriousness.  
105In this case the offender's acts in dismembering Mr Kelly's head, the precision with which that was done, as described in the autopsy report, the attempt to set his body and Mr Kelly's home alight, in order to conceal his crime and then callously disposing of his head, plainly sheds considerable light on the seriousness of his offence. 
106These were brutal and unnecessary acts, entirely consistent, not only with the anger the offender has repeatedly said he felt towards Mr Kelly, but with real contempt and hatred.  Those feelings were starkly contrasted by the care he told Professor Greenberg he gave the bird which he released from Mr Kelly's home, in order that it should not be burnt.
107These matters shed considerable light on the seriousness of this awful offence and must be taken into account by way of aggravation.   
The offender's personal circumstances
108Consideration must also be given to the evidence of the offender's personal circumstances.
109The offender told Dr Nielssen that he was the middle of three children.  His parents separated when he was aged 8 years and he then lived with his mother, who remarried, but her new partner was very detached and did not get involved with him.  His father had been physically abusive to his mother.  He also remarried and had two more children.
110The offender left school without matriculating.  He had been bullied at school, where his literacy was good, but his memory poor.  He had no criminal record, but had been involved in violence associated with driving when he was young, as well as when he worked as a security guard.    
111He had served in the army and had worked in the construction industry, including as a project supervisor.  He had a certificate 4 in risk management and in occupational, health and safety, as well as diplomas in sports science and building and construction.  He was a registered builder in Queensland.  He had also worked in the security industry, including 4 weeks in Iraq on a security contract.
112The offender said he had then started an earth moving business and later a wholesale nursery with his wife, which he had sold in order to invest with his brother-in-law in an 87 acre property in order to develop a resort.  The plan failed and the purchaser could not raise finance because of the global financial crisis and the deposit was taken up with holding and interest fees.  He found himself working a 12 hour day to keep his share of the property.
113He said that he had bought the Broadwater property on the assumption that he could finance building a house there, with what the sale of his share of the resort would raise.  He had been married for 12 years, but had no children.  His wife left him after his arrest and they were now bankrupt.  He did not have many friends, played no sport, but was interested in weight lifting. 
114The offender reported  a similar background to Professor Greenberg, but then claimed that he had had more than 100 different jobs during adulthood.  He had worked as a carpenter and builder after completing a 4 year apprenticeship.  He had worked in concreting, home renovations and as a labourer.  He claimed his longest job had lasted for 12 months.  The nursery business had lasted two years, while he managed two other businesses, which proved to be too much.  He had also worked as a personal trainer for a year.  He also reported serving in the military for two years and being discharged for alcohol abuse.  He claimed to have worked in Iraq and elsewhere overseas for a security contractor where he had come under fire.  
115He said that prior to the offence he was trying to keep his financial head above water.  Ten years previously he had an investment property from which he was counting on making a sizeable profit.  That project collapsed during the GFC, when he lost about $250,000.  He had bought the Broadwater property beforehand, as well as another investment property.
Mitigating factors
116The offender submitted that the mitigating matters specified in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevant to take into account on sentencing were his plea and s 21A(3):""(b)   the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity(e)   the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions(f)  the offender was a person of good character(g)   the offender is unlikely to re-offend(h)  The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise(i)   the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:(i)   the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and(ii)   the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)""

Record, character, re-offending and rehabilitation - s 21A(e),(f), (g) and (h)
117There was no issue as to the offender's lack of prior record, that he was a person of prior good character and that he is unlikely to re-offend.  
118The offender is presently aged 47 years and will be in his 60's when first eligible for release on parole.  He has no relevant criminal record, having only committed one driving offence some years ago. The Crown also accepted on the evidence that he had good prospects for rehabilitation. 
119These are all mitigating factors which I have taken into account in this sentencing exercise.
Planning - s 21A(3)(b)
120I am satisfied, however, that the offender's submission that this was not a planned killing must be rejected.  
121The offender's concession that his offence was not spontaneous does not, it must be accepted, establish that it was planned.  Such a finding must rest on the evidence.   
122The relevant evidence is that the first time that the offender spoke of killing Mr Kelly, after their confrontation over the tree, was while he was with Mr Ellis, at a time when on his own repeated accounts, he was extremely angry with Mr Kelly.  While it must certainly be accepted that in some circumstances such a statement may not reveal intent, in this case the offender not only made that threat, he then went and got both a pistol and ammunition, which he showed Mr Ellis.  
123Consistent with the formation of an intention to kill Mr Kelly, the offender took a pistol with him, when he later went to the hotel.  There he told Mr Degotardi untrue things about himself and Mr Kelly.  That behaviour was consistent with other untrue claims which the offender has made about himself in the past, which are dealt with in the psychiatrists' reports, as I have explained, but what those facts reveal is the continuing state of his feelings towards Mr Kelly on 17 June 2012.
124As he later told Professor Greenberg, that day he was very angry with Mr Kelly.  He considered that what had happened earlier that day to be 'the last straw'.  He did not act immediately on these feelings but plainly planned what he later did.  
125Later that night he went in the dark to Mr Kelly's home, where he had never been before, not only armed with a loaded pistol, but on his own account to Dr Nielssen, with his finger on the trigger when he knocked on the door, shooting Mr Kelly without any prior warning when the door was opened.  That is entirely consistent with that shooting being the result of planning.  
126That the evidence does not establish whether the offender loaded the firearm before he left his own home, or only when he reached Mr Kelly's home, as was submitted for the offender to be relevant, in the circumstances does not establish absence of planning.  When he knocked on the door the offender was not only armed with that loaded gun, he had his finger on the trigger, ready to shoot.  He killed Mr Kelly with a single shot to the head, without saying anything and before Mr Kelly had a chance to take any defensive steps.  These were not spontaneous acts.  They were planned.
127Even if it could be accepted that Mr Kelly came to the door armed with a knife or that he had a shot gun, as the offender variously claimed, which I am satisfied it cannot, the evidence established that the offender went to Mr Kelly's home, plainly prepared to do what he had told Mr Ellis he would do many hours before, namely to kill Mr Kelly.  That is what he did.  On the evidence that was unquestionably the result of what he had planned to do.  As a result of that planning, when Mr Kelly came to the door the offender was able to strike immediately.  He then took steps to cover his crime, by burning Mr Kelly's body after mutilating it, by setting fire to his home.  That, too, is also consistent with prior planning.  
128I am satisfied that this evidence established planning beyond reasonable doubt.  In the result this mitigating factor, that the offence was not planned, was not established.
Remorse 
129It is well settled that a plea of guilty may indicate acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice (see Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; (2002) 209 CLR 339), but that the strength of the Crown case is also relevant to the evaluation of the existence of remorse (see R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225; (2004) 41 MVR 40 at [12]).
130A plea entered in the face of overwhelming evidence of the offence committed, may result in the discount which flows from the utilitarian savings which flow from plea, but without more, will not establish remorse of the kind with which s 21A(3)(i) is concerned.
131As explained in Alvares v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33; (2011) 209 A Crim R 297 at [44] by Buddin J: 
""Remorse in [a sentencing] context means regret for the wrongdoing which the offender's actions have caused because it can be safely assumed that an offender will always regret the fact that he or she has been apprehended. Remorse is but one feature of post-offence conduct upon which an offender may seek to rely as a matter which has the potential to mitigate penalty. The manner in which the issue of remorse is approached is not unique to either the sentencing process or to the courtroom. Indeed, it is a common feature of everyday existence. Ordinary human experience would suggest that it is only natural that a person who has committed some misdeed would wish to make the most favourable impression possible in seeking to make amends for it.""

132In this case the offender gave no evidence.  His submission that there was evidence of remorse rested on the entry of his plea, the remorse which he expressed to Dr Nielssen and the fact that he had not pursued a mental illness defence.
133Given what was revealed by the forensic examination and the autopsy report, it is evident that the Crown case against the offender was a strong one.  That was accepted by entry of the plea, which also accepted that the offender did not have a mental illness defence.  
134It is in that context that the differing accounts which the offender gave beforehand to Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg must be considered.  To Dr Nielssen the offender described the onset of hallucinations of voices and paranoia in his late twenties.  He had experienced periods of depression for which he was treated, but had never received psychological treatment.  He told Dr Nielssen that he had been experiencing hallucinations of a voice for about a year before the offence, which he thought was his dad, which was especially strong on the day of the offence.  The voice then said take it off and he used a knife to cut off his head.  He later overhead voices he took to be coming from the police while in the Northern Territory.  
135The offender gave a somewhat different history to Professor Greenberg.  Then he reported not only past treatment with antidepressant medication, but also treatment by a psychologist.  He then said that he had been hearing voices since age 13, which had been precipated by his parents' divorce.  That voice made him feel paranoid, that he was doing the wrong things and that people were talking about him in a negative fashion.  He initially told Professor Greenberg that he did not know if he was hearing any voices at the time of the offence and then that he might have and finally that he had no recall of then hearing any voices.
136These inconsistent accounts do not establish that the offender in truth had been suffering from hallucinations prior to or at the time of the murder, or that he had a mental illness defence, which he gave up by his plea.  That is rather, consistent with an abandonment of his other untruthful accounts as to other matters in his past about which he gave conflicting accounts.
137That the abandonment of these untruths and the entry of his plea, established the remorse which the offender told Dr Nielssen he had developed since being in custody is hard to credit, particularly given how little he has revealed as to where he disposed of Mr Kelly's head.  If he truly had the feelings of remorse which he then claimed to have developed, it would be expected that since then, he would have given a full account of what he did to dispose of that part of Mr Kelly's mutilated body.   
138In the result, I am not convinced that the evidence establishes that the offender has accepted necessary responsibility for his actions, which resulted in the brutal and unprovoked death of Mr Kelly, or that he has taken the step available to him to make reparation for what he has done.   
139Accordingly, I have not been able to take remorse into account by way of mitigation of this offence.
Mental illness
140The offender had some treatment for depression and anxiety in the past.  It is common ground that the offender has a depressive condition, but its severity and consequences were in dispute.  
141The offender submitted that it would be concluded that the contribution of his mental condition fell somewhere between the opinions reached by the two psychiatrists as to its severity, but that it would be concluded that this illness had contributed to a material degree to his offence, relying on Iskander v R [2103] NSWCCA 235 at [29] and Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290.
142It is settled that a mental illness can have the effect of reducing a person's moral culpability for an offence and that it may also have the result that matters such as general deterrence, retribution and denunciation must be given less weight in the sentencing exercise (see Muldrock v The Queen at [53]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23] and R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR at 354).  
143That is especially so where the evidence shows that the offender's mental condition contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way (see Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177].)  However, a causal relationship between the mental disorder or abnormality and the commission of the offence will not always result in a reduced sentence, because in some cases such an illness can increase the importance of particular deterrence, or of the need to protect the public (see R v Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67 Gleeson CJ said at 71).
144Much depends on the nature of the mental condition.  As was explained in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48, where Hunt CJ at CL (Gleeson CJ and Hidden J agreeing) said at p50 - 51:
""It is an accepted principle of sentencing that general deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others. [Regina v Anderson [1981] VR 155 at 160-161; Regina v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at 86.] In most of the cases in which that principle is applied, the offender has suffered from a significant mental illness or retardation, but such a condition is not a necessary condition for the principle to be applied. [Regina v Anderson (at 160); Regina v Martin John Letteri (CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported) at 12-13.] Considerations of general (or even personal) deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant, and the significance of the offender's mental incapacity is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case. [Regina v Owen Neil Currie (CCA, 25 February 1992, unreported) at 4; Regina v Martin John Letteri (at 13-14).] The reason for the principle is that the interests of society do not require such persons to be punished as severely as persons without that disability because such severity is inappropriate to their circumstances. [Regina v Anderson (at 160-161).] The full understanding of the authority and requirements of the law which is attributed to the ordinary individual of adult intellectual capacities cannot be expected of a person whose intellectual function is insufficient to have that understanding. [Regina v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244 at 254-255.] The means by which the courts give effect to that principle (as an instrument of social administration) is to moderate the consideration of general deterrence to the circumstances of the particular case. [Ibid (at 255).] But, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great. [Regina v Maria Elizabeth Anne Curtis (CCA, 13 November 1987, unreported,) at 3-4. See also Regina v Steven Edward Bus & Anor (CCA, 3 November 1995, unreported) at 6-7; Regina v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68.]"" 

145In this case, notwithstanding what the offender later told Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg and what they concluded as to his depressive condition, the evidence of the steps which the offender took to conceal his offence, later to abscond and what he told his wife to do, are all entirely consistent with him having a full understanding at the time of what he had done to Mr Kelly and what the requirements of the law were.  This murder was the result of the anger which the offender felt towards Mr Kelly, not of his depressive condition.  
146That conclusion is reinforced when consideration is given to the evidence of the limited prior impact of his condition on his everyday life.  Despite his condition, on his various accounts the offender was both high functioning and successful in his life.  He was married and had prospered in his working life.  It was the impact of the global financial crisis which had adversely affected his financial circumstances, not his mental condition, although that loss plainly affected his condition adversely.  Those effects were not, however, of such an extent that he did not have a proper appreciation of what he was doing to Mr Kelly when he shot him, for conduct which he considered to be 'the last straw'.  His subsequent behaviour is also consistent with him then having such an understanding.  
147In the result, while I accept that deterrence, both general and specific, must have a somewhat lesser role to play in the sentence to be imposed upon the offender than would have been the case had he not suffered the condition which the experts diagnosed, I am satisfied that it must still feature to some extent in this sentencing exercise.
Comparable cases
148The offender submitted that on sentencing there was only one other case which would shed light on an appropriate sentence, that being R v Kearnes (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1652.  There the offender was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 22 years, 6 months, in circumstances where the evidence did not establish whether it was the offender or his co-offender who shot their victim from close range with a shotgun, intending to kill him.  The offender never accepted any responsibility for his offence, nor did he express any remorse, by way of plea or otherwise.  
149That offender was diagnosed with a dependence on alcohol, a substance abuse disorder, in regard to amphetamines and prescription medication, and maladaptive personality traits, but was found not to be suffering any psychosis or emotional problems such as depression.   He had a criminal record dating from age 14, of not significant seriousness apart from offences of armed robbery, one including sexual violence.  That offender claimed to have suffered alcoholic blackouts.  The truthfulness of those claims was not accepted.
150Care must always be exercised when use is sought to be made of such comparisons.  I found this decision to be not of much assistance in this sentencing exercise, given the differences between the two offenders and their offences.  Very pertinently, for example, in this case there is no question that it was the offender who shot Mr Kelly.  
151The sentence here imposed must reflect this offender's moral culpability for the very serious offence which he has committed, in the light of the evidence which sheds light on his offending, assessed in the way that I have earlier described.
Discount on sentence for the guilty plea
152It was common ground that it is within my discretion to grant the offender a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, in accordance with the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  
153The purpose of such a utilitarian discount was there explained by the Chief Justice as reflecting the benefits which flow from a guilty plea for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as to witnesses and victims, who, as the result of such a plea, are spared having to give evidence and the personal rumination of traumatic events, which is inevitably involved in that process.  A trial judge must identify these benefits when sentencing, in order to provide an incentive to offenders to enter such a plea, so that such benefits will, in fact, be derived (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [115] to [123]).
154The Crown's position was that the plea had not been entered at the earliest opportunity and so the maximum 25% discount was not available.  The offender submitted that it was, relying on his April 2013 offer to plead guilty to manslaughter.
155The principles which govern the exercise of the discretion are those discussed in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1.  They include at [32] that the discount is to be determined largely by the timing of the entry of the plea, so that the earlier the plea is entered, the greater the discount available (see at 1) and (at 8) that 'the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced'.
156The offender did not enter his plea at the earliest opportunity and so the maximum discount of 25% is not available to him.  An offer to enter a plea to a lesser offence cannot be equated with an offer to enter a plea to the more serious offence to which a plea is in fact later entered.  The offender's plea was entered on arraignment, however, with the result that many of the benefits which the Chief Justice discussed in R v Thomson; R v Houlton have flown, albeit there were still some issues lying between the parties which had to be resolved on sentencing.  
157In the result, I have concluded that the Crown's submission that the offender is not entitled to a discount greater than 18%, to reflect those benefits, must be accepted.
Special circumstances
158In this case neither party submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances which warrant a departure from the ordinary statutory ratio established by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
159I am satisfied that the statutory ratio provides an appropriate period of supervision for this offender, prior to the expiration of his sentence and that his circumstances do not warrant any departure from the statutory ratio.
Victim Impact Statement
160From what I have said about the awful circumstances of Mr Kelly's death, it will be apparent that what is said by the Court in these remarks, can give but very small comfort to his family and friends.
161Four victim impact statements were read at the sentencing hearing by Mr Kelly's sister, Ms Simmons.  Those statements were made by her and Mr Kelly's other two sisters, Ms Davis and Ms Keating, and the fourth by his partner Ms Mikkelsen.
162Every person who heard Ms Simmons read out those statements can only have been moved by the sorrow, grief and anger which were variously expressed in those statements over Mr Kelly's awful death and by the difficult task which Ms Simmons so bravely undertook in reading them out in open Court in front of the offender and strangers present. 
163Mr Kelly's family will understand that I may not take these unsworn, untested victim impact statements into account in sentencing the offender, for reasons which I am sure will have been explained to them, by reference to the decided cases which bind me. 
164It is hoped, however, that they will gain some peace of mind by an understanding of what the evidence has revealed about how Mr Kelly came to be murdered and how our society and its criminal justice system, has dealt with that terrible crime.
165For my own part, I extend to all of Mr Kelly's family and friends, my deepest sympathy for his death, the loss which they have suffered and the very understandable grief and anguish it continues to cause them.
The sentence
166I have considered all of the matters I have mentioned and have concluded that the sentence to be imposed for this offence must commence on 1 July 2012, the date from which the offender has been in continuous custody since his arrest.  
167But for the discount, I would have imposed a sentence of 31 years on this offender.  With the 18% discount, the total term of his imprisonment will be 25 years, 5 months.  The application of the statutory ratio results in a non-parole period of 19 years and a balance of term of 6 years, 4 months.  This means that the earliest date that the offender will be eligible for release is 30 June 2031.  That will depend on him convincing the Parole Authority that he should be then released on parole.  The sentence will expire on 31 October 2037. 
168It is finally also necessary to mention the effect of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, which applies to ""serious violence offences"", which include the offence of murder (see s 5A).  The effect of this Act is that the State can apply to the Supreme Court for an order that the offender continue to receive supervision or remain in detention (see s 5E).  If the Court is then satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that the offender would be a ""high risk offender"", that is an offender who poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision, it may make an order for extended supervision (see s 5F).   An order for continuing detention may be made if the Court is then satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order (see s 5G).   
Orders
169Jonathon Stenberg you are convicted of the murder of Edward James Kelly.
170You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 19 years, commencing on 1 July 2012 and expiring on 30 June 2031.  I set a balance of term of 6 years, 4 months, which is to commence on 1 July 2031 and to expire on 31 October 2037.  The earliest date that you will be eligible for release on parole is 30 June 2031.  Your sentence will expire on 31 October 2037.

2762959,R v Ryan [2013] NSWCCA 316,"Judgment

1THE COURT : On 19 September 2013, the Court made an order allowing the Crown appeal in this matter pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the Act). In addition, the Court vacated the rulings of Quirk DCJ on 13 May 2013 with respect to the admissibility of all recorded conversations between the complainant and the respondent, and determined that those recorded conversations are admissible. These are the reasons for those orders.

2The respondent pleaded not guilty on 6 May 2013 to an indictment containing 17 counts variously charging sexual and physical assaults by the respondent against his adopted daughter. It is not necessary to set out in detail the charges in the indictment. There are four counts of aggravated indecent assault, four counts of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 16 in circumstances of aggravation, three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of common assault, all said to have occurred between 1994 and 2000. There are two alternative counts of aggravated indecent assault.

3Following a voir dire hearing, her Honour made the impugned rulings. The trial has been adjourned to 3 February 2014.

The Crown Case

4What follows is a summary of the case the Crown seeks to prove. The complainant was born on 12 February 1980. In 1993 when she was 12 or 13 years of age her mother met and began a relationship with the respondent. In October 1993 the complainant and her mother moved into the respondent's home.

5The respondent was physically affectionate towards the complainant from the outset. The respondent frequently told her that such physical affection was ordinary behaviour between fathers and daughters. The respondent later began to touch the complainant's breasts and genitalia. He reassured her that this was also normal father-daughter behaviour, although he cautioned her not to tell anyone.

6The various indecent assaults included touching the complainant's breasts and genitalia on the outside of, and inside her clothing. These assaults occurred in the complainant's bed at night or during drives to and from school. The respondent frequently told the complainant that he wanted to be her father and that fathers and daughters behaved in this way. He told her that her mother would be much happier if they had a father/daughter relationship.

7In 1994 the complainant complained about the respondent's behaviour towards her. The Department of Community Services and the police became involved. After a few days, the complainant retracted her allegations, claiming she had made them up. She and her mother continued to live with the respondent.

8Thereafter, the behaviour of the respondent escalated to regular acts of sexual intercourse by penile penetration of the complainant's mouth, vagina and anus. The complainant did not resist these assaults, partly because she believed it was normal and partly because she was in fear of the respondent and his level of control over her.

9The complainant ultimately complained to a school friend that the respondent would touch and lick her breasts, touch her clitoris and have her suck his penis. When the complainant was 15 or 16 years of age the complainant also told her brother that the respondent had been sexually molesting her. At that particular time, the complainant had run away from home and was staying with friends. She returned to the family home shortly thereafter.

10Shortly before the complainant's 18th birthday, the respondent formally adopted the complainant and she changed her surname to Ryan. The relationship between the complainant and the respondent became more physically violent and oppressive.

11In early 2000 the complainant's mother separated from the respondent and moved away. The complainant continued to live with the respondent. Shortly after her mother left the premises, the respondent assaulted the complainant causing injuries that required her hospitalisation. The respondent was charged by police with assault, but the charge was later dismissed when the complainant failed to attend the hearing.

12During the years the complainant lived with the respondent, other persons noticed the unusual nature of the respondent's relationship with her, including the purchase of expensive gifts, such as cars and revealing clothing. The respondent also conducted himself in a sexually provocative way with the complainant, such as arranging for a male stripper to attend her 16th birthday function and organising for the stripper to be paid an additional fee if he had sex with the complainant.

13In late 2000, the complainant's maternal uncle assisted her to leave the respondent's house and she moved to her mother's home. 

14In May 2010 the complainant contacted police and made a statement setting out the sexual and physical assaults upon her from the age of 13 or 14 until the time she left the respondent's home in late 2000. However, charges were not laid at this time.

15In early 2011 the respondent made enquiries of the complainant through a former school friend. The respondent asked the school friend to have the complainant contact him and left his business card with her. The school friend conveyed this request to the complainant. A warrant was obtained authorising the interception of telephone calls between the complainant and the respondent.

16The complainant telephoned the respondent on 30 June, 7 July, 18 July and 19 July 2011. Each of these conversations was lawfully recorded. On 24 July 2011 the complainant met with the respondent in a public park. The conversation was again lawfully recorded via a listening device. The telephone calls and the conversation in the park were the subject of the voir dire proceedings.

The Court's Jurisdiction

17The enlivening of this Court's jurisdiction pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Act arises where the ruling on the admissibility of the evidence either eliminates or substantially weakens the Crown case. The Crown submits that the exclusion of the recorded conversations substantially weakens the Crown case.

18The Crown case falls roughly into six categories :-

(i)Direct evidence from the complainant of the commission of the alleged offences.

(ii)Evidence supporting to some extent peripheral detail relevant to the incidents alleged by the complainant.

(iii)Complaint evidence, admissible pursuant to ss 66 and/or 108 of the Evidence Act 1995.

(iv)Context evidence which establishes the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the respondent.

(v)Tendency evidence.

(vi)Statements in the nature of admissions by the respondent in the excluded recordings of conversations (the pretext conversations).

19The first category consists of a 49 page statement made by the complainant to police in May 2010. The complainant gives details of the several charges in addition to numerous instances of other sexual and physical assaults upon her during the time she lived with the respondent. The Crown proposes to rely upon the generally controlling and oppressive nature of the relationship, as described by the complainant, in order to explain her submission over many years, even after her mother left the family home. 

20As is frequently the case with allegations of sexual assault by a person in loco parentis against a child, as well as allegations of sexual intercourse without consent, the complainant's evidence of the sexual and physical assaults against her is the only direct evidence of the charges on indictment. A direction consistent with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 will no doubt be requested and given, that is, that the jury ought scrutinise the complainant's evidence carefully before acting upon it to convict the respondent. 

21In such cases, where the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the complainant's evidence, and where significant delay occurs between the commission of the offences and complaint (entitling the respondent to a direction concerning the significant forensic disadvantage occasioned by that delay), issues of credibility and reliability obviously loom large. In this trial, there is an additional overlay : the complainant has previously retracted a complaint and in her early adult years the complainant attempted suicide and indulged in drug abuse. These are all fertile areas for an effective and entirely legitimate attack upon the complainant's veracity. However, for the purpose of determining jurisdiction under s 5F(3A), these matters should be put to one side : R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 ; 66 NSWLR 228, at [39] - [40].

22The second category of evidence derives principally from the complainant's mother, a school friend of the complainant and a former girlfriend of the respondent. That evidence generally establishes that the respondent was often alone with the complainant in the house, that he was seen emerging from her bedroom at night, that he bought expensive gifts and hired a male stripper for her 16th birthday. 

23The complaint evidence (category (iii)) comes from two school friends to whom the complainant separately complained at about the time of her 16th birthday. It appears likely that this evidence would be admitted under s 66 of the Evidence Act or under s 108 in response to a suggestion in cross examination that the allegations are fabrications. Failing a restriction as to its use (s 136), the complaint evidence may be available towards proof of some of the charges (s 60). 

24Categories (iv) and (v) overlap to a considerable extent. A number of witnesses are able to give evidence of seeing the respondent treat the complainant in a highly sexualised way. This evidence, the evidence relating to the hire of a male stripper, evidence of physical assaults upon the complainant and evidence relating to the respondent's role in paying for a motel room so that the complainant could have sexual intercourse with her first boyfriend, are pressed as tendency evidence by the Crown. The admissibility of that evidence upon that basis is yet to be determined. However, much, if not all of it may well be available as context evidence, in that it explains a number of features of the complainant's behaviour that might otherwise undermine her credibility. The complainant's retraction of her complaint when she was 14 years of age, her failure to complain thereafter and her decision to remain living with the respondent after her mother had left the relationship, all fall to be evaluated against the background of the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the respondent. 

25It is convenient here to summarise the most salient aspects of the excluded conversations. In so doing, we have omitted numerous references by the complainant to physical assaults and sexual activity between herself and the respondent which the respondent does not deny, although his responses do not amount to clear admissions. 

26The most salient aspects of the telephone conversations include references by the complainant to introducing ""the sexual relationship .. into the house"" and asking the respondent why he introduced ""that sexual part into the father and daughter relationship"" at a time when the complainant was 12 or 13 years of age. The respondent declines to talk about it over the phone on the basis that ""too many people can hear it"". The respondent also acknowledges that he should not have ""belted"" the complainant on a number of occasions. Later references by the complainant to her need to discuss their relationship so that she could ""put it behind her"" and ""move on"", coupled with the respondent's concern that the complainant would record any conversation wherein that relationship was discussed, demonstrate an understanding on the part of the respondent of the subject matter of the conversation and the likely topic of discussion at any future face-to-face meeting. 

27During the conversation in the park, the respondent admits to hitting the complainant, claims that the complainant initiated a sexual relationship between them, maintains that ""a lot of fathers"" have a sexual relationship with their daughters, agrees with the complainant that there was sexual activity between them which he stopped and then resumed on a number of occasions, admits ""introducing"" sex into the father/daughter relationship, admits remorse ""for what [he had] done"" to the complainant and admits that he had enjoyed ""the sex part"" of their relationship.

28The probative effect of the conversations is illustrated by the following two passages:

""Complainant: [W]hy did you introduce the sex part like, why didn't, if I was that type of a person, I was saying it like, at the age of 12 to 13 I said to you, I said, if I came onto you in the wrong sense, why didn't you come up to me knowing too well that it was wrong? Why didn't you come up to me and say look, that's not the right thing, way to go about things? Why did you go ahead and completely act on it? Why did you go ahead and say to me yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine, that's fine, that's what father's and daughters do?

Respondent: Well they do, do, a lot of fathers do. You'd be surprised how many do it but anyway, that doesn't matter. I -


Complainant: Do you think it's wrong for fathers and daughters to have sex?

........

Complaintant: Do you think it's right for fathers and daughters to do that?

Respondent: No, No.

Complainant: Well why did you continue to do it? Why did you continue to let it happen? Why did you continue -

Respondent: Why did you continue to let it happen? Because you kept on agreeing with it."" (emphasis added)

..........

""Complainant: It's not something [ ....] that I want to sit here and talk, and talk about on a Sunday afternoon. O.K. But at the end of the day I've got to take, I've got to take the good with the bad and I've got to actually sit and talk about it for own wellbeing, my own mental health.

Respondent: But [....] you, you make out that everything that done to you is, is, is all the bad things in life, which is bullshit.

Complainant: The sex part of it, yeah, there, it was bad.

Respondent: All right.

Complainant: Are you saying that it was good? Are you saying that you enjoyed it?

Respondent: Yes, I did, but anyway, I'm not saying it was right but I enjoyed it, yes."" (emphasis added)

29The admissions contained within the recorded conversations are to be considered as part of the Crown case for the purposes of the jurisdictional ambit of s 5F(3A). The Court need not distinguish between the strength of the Crown case on individual counts and that it should proceed on the basis that the jury accepts the evidence summarised above, together with the excluded conversations, without attempting to qualify the weight that may be attached to that evidence. 

30Both the content of these admissions and the manner in which they are made are highly probative of the Crown case. The Court listened to the recording of the conversation in the park for the purposes of determining whether the respondent appeared to be experiencing any difficulty hearing or understanding the complainant, as well as for the purpose of assessing the tenor of the conversation. The respondent responds appropriately, without pause, without seeking clarification or repetition from the complainant, and often in a belligerent and assertive voice.

31There is nothing equivocal about many of the respondent's statements in the course of these conversations. When one takes into account the respondent's assertions during his record of interview with police, after the recording is played to him, that he never had sex with the complainant, that she was speaking of having sex with other people whom she brought home on a regular basis, and that she had made the same false allegations against her natural father, the probative value of the recorded conversations is strengthened.

32Taking the Crown case in all six categories at its highest, that is, putting to one side issues of credibility and reliability, it is a cogent one. It is also clear that the exclusion of the recorded conversations renders it a much less cogent Crown case, in that it ultimately stands or falls on the complainant's evidence. We were therefore persuaded that the exclusion of the recorded conversations substantially weakens the prosecution case. Whilst not formally abandoning his written submissions which resisted that conclusion, the respondent's senior counsel only faintly argued the point on the hearing of the appeal. 

The Evidence on the Voir Dire and the Trial Judge's Reasons

33The admission of the pretext conversations was resisted on the basis of ss 90 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. Following the voir dire hearing, the judge excluded the conversations on both bases. The judge's reasons focussed almost exclusively on the conversation in the park, although the telephone conversations that preceded it are integral to an appreciation of the respondent's decision to meet the complainant in person. 

34Several findings of fact by the judge underpinned the exclusion of the evidence. It is important to appreciate those findings of fact and the extent to which, on the Crown submissions, they are not supported by the evidence.

35Thirteen findings of fact were made as follows :-

(1)The respondent had a hearing impairment for many years prior to these events, namely nerve damage to his ear with some hearing loss and tinnitus for which he required a hearing aid. Without the hearing aid, he was troubled by background noise.

(2)The respondent was not wearing his hearing aid on 24 July 2011 during the conversation in the public park.

(3)A few days prior to the conversation in the park, the respondent had a back operation which debilitated him so that he could not drive and could not sit for periods of time.

(4)During the conversation in the park, the respondent was in discomfort and pain, was irritable and aggravated and could not hear properly.

(5)Parts of the recording of the conversation in the park, which was played to the respondent during his record of interview, were not comprehended by the respondent until it was played to him again when he was wearing a hearing aid.

(6)The conversation in the park involved over talking, particularly by the complainant, with a level of frustration being exhibited by the respondent. His answers at various times were incomplete.

(7)The complainant made lengthy assertions and statements. The respondent's responses were not fully articulated.

(8)The respondent was in a vulnerable position, both medically and emotionally.

(9)The complainant put no specific allegations to the respondent other than using terms such as ""what we had"" or ""it"" or ""the sexual thing"".

(10)The respondent was overborne during the conversation in the park.

(11)The complainant used trickery, subterfuge and lies in order to get the respondent to speak to her, thereby compromising his right to silence.

(12)The explanation provided by the officer in charge for not charging the respondent prior to the conversation in the park is questionable.

(13)The complainant was acting as an agent of the State in conducting the pretext conversations.


36Findings, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 derived substantially from the respondent's evidence and that of his step-son.

37The respondent's evidence was that he had suffered a work-related accident in 1970 which resulted in nerve damage to his left ear. He suffered from tinnitus and was under the care of an audiologist, whom he saw in March 2011 and again in 2012. The respondent said that he wore a hearing aid, although he attempted not to wear it on at least one day of the weekend ""to let the ear canal dry"". The respondent said that excessive noise makes him irritable and ringing in the ear makes it very difficult to hear. The respondent said that he did have the hearing aid in place during the record of interview with police, although he did not have the hearing aid in place during the conversation in the park on 24 July 2011. In addition, the respondent had undergone a back operation approximately a fortnight prior to the conversation in the park. He said that he was in pain, and could not sit for long periods of time. The pain and traffic noise made him irritable. 

38The respondent's stepson drove the respondent to the park on the day in question. He agreed that he did not ask the complainant to repeat any particular part of the conversation. However he said that he was ""very aggravated and .. didn't really want to be there, and .. . Didn't want to listen to all the rubbish that she was talking about. So [he] was answering questions to get it over and done with and get away from there."" He claimed that he ""couldn't hear anything correctly, properly"".

39Under cross-examination, the respondent acknowledged that during the police interview he had asked the officer to repeat anything that he did not hear or understand. He also acknowledged that the recording which was played to him during the record of interview was not the first time that he had heard the conversation, given that he had been present when it originally took place. He agreed that he did not tell the police that there were ""lots of little things"" that he had heard for the first time during the record of interview. When asked what it was in the conversation that he heard differently, he replied ""minor words which I can't tell you what they are now.""

40The Crown Prosecutor then took the respondent to specific passages in the conversation and asked the respondent what portion of those passages the respondent did not hear. On each occasion the respondent agreed that he had heard the words but said that he had misunderstood what it was that the complainant was referring to. Ultimately the Crown Prosecutor put to the respondent ""so really what you are saying is you didn't mishear what she said, or not hear it properly, just that you misunderstood what she was meaning by what she was saying?"" To this question the respondent answered ""I guess that's correct.""

41The respondent's step son confirmed the back operation, the fact that the respondent was not wearing his hearing aid on the day in question and that the respondent ""seemed a little bit aggravated and a bit distraught when he got back to the car.""

42Whilst findings 1, 2 and 3 were open to her Honour, they did not, when taken together with all the evidence, support the essence of findings 4 and 5, which was that the respondent could not hear the complainant sufficiently in order to participate meaningfully in the conversation in the park. The respondent's general irritability and agitation arising from the back operation and the tinnitus were advanced by the respondent during the voir dire as an explanation for his generally gruff and aggressive tone of voice. His emotional state, his tinnitus and the extent to which he may have been vulnerable (finding 8) had little or no bearing on his capacity to hear the words spoken by the complainant and to comprehend them in the face of the respondent's own acknowledgement in cross-examination that he heard what the complainant was saying but misconstrued her meaning.

43It was never suggested that the respondent had any difficulty hearing and comprehending the complainant during the telephone calls. That was of some significance because during the first of those phone calls the respondent acknowledged that he had initiated contact with the complainant after 10 years by leaving his business card with a school friend of the complainant's in the expectation that the complainant would call him.

44Findings 6, 7 and 9 rest on the recording itself. Whatever construction may ultimately be placed upon the respondent's answers, when considered in the context of the conversation in its entirety, the judge was obliged to consider the probative value of the evidence at its highest for the purposes of the exercise required by ss 90 and 137. It was never contested that the respondent's statements in the conversation amounted to admissions. 

45In the course of her reasons, her Honour acknowledged as much. Her Honour agreed with the Crown submission that any alternative meaning placed by the respondent upon the conversation is not relevant for the purposes of determining whether any given portion of the conversation is capable of amounting to an admission.

46Findings 10, 11, 12 and 13 constitute the substantive basis upon which the judge excluded the pretext conversations. The height of the submissions by senior counsel for the respondent was two-fold. First, that the respondent was the victim of trickery and subterfuge, that his choice to speak or remain silent had been compromised by the method of investigation adopted by the police, that is, that in effect the complainant had acted as an agent of the State. Second, that the references to the sexual relationship between the complainant and the respondent in the conversation were of such generality and vagueness that they could not be related to any of the 17 counts on the indictment and that accordingly, notwithstanding directions to the contrary, the jury would attribute undue weight to those admissions and be deflected from satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of the ingredients of each particular charge. 

47That her Honour accepted these submissions is evident from the following passage from her Honour's reasons :-

Because of the marked generality and vagueness of the conversations, bearing in mind that the alleged sexual relationship took place over approximately 6 years, for which reason the charges of sexual intercourse against the accused are brought under different sections of the Act, depending on the age of the complainant at the time of the alleged offences, and for the reasons articulated by Mr Bellanto as set out above, I find that the probative value of the evidence sought to be relied upon as admissions is not high and is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice in the way that Mr Bellanto outlined and I exclude the evidence.

The Grounds of Appeal

48The Crown advances three grounds of appeal. The first two are related and may be dealt with together.

(1) The Trial Judge Erred in Finding that the Probative Value of the Evidence of Admissions was Not High.

(2) The Trial Judge Erred in Excluding the Evidence of Admissions Pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.

49Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides that :-

the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.

50It is not necessary to repeat at length the flaws in the judge's assessment of the probative value of the admissions. Once it is accepted that there was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the respondent did not hear and comprehend what was being said by the complainant in the pretext conversations, the admissions provide powerful evidence in support of the Crown case. They contradict the respondent's own denials to police of any sexual relationship with, or physical abuse of, the complainant and they contradict the respondent's assertions that the complainant has fabricated the allegations. The generalised or vague references to ""the sexual relationship"" do not detract from that aspect of their probative value. For these reasons ground 1 was upheld.

51To the extent that the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent was identified by the judge, her Honour appeared to simply adopt the submission of senior counsel to the effect that the jury would assign a weight to the admissions that they did not deserve.

52The danger of unfair prejudice of which s 137 speaks is the risk that the jury will ""use the evidence or be affected by it in a way that the law does not permit"": Pfennig v the Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 528 (McHugh J), which may also be expressed as a likelihood that the jury will ""give the evidence more weight than it deserves or ... the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task"" : McHugh J in Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [51].

53Apart from references to senior counsel's global submissions that ""even strong directions"" would not cure the risk of unfair prejudice, her Honour did not address the nature or extent of that risk in the instant case in the light of proper and ameliorative directions from the trial judge. Even where admissions are equivocal or ambiguous, and where a sexual relationship is not in issue, save for the timing of the sexual activity, such pretext conversations have been held admissible, provided the jury are properly directed : see Christian v R [2012] NSWCCA 34. Drawing on that decision, a number of directions are capable of curing relevant prejudice in this case, including :-

76 ... the jury ... should only use this evidence as an admission if they were satisfied that:
(a) in respect of any particular allegation made in the pretext conversation, the [respondent] had by his speech, silence or conduct admitted the truth of the allegation;
(b) to the extent that the Crown was relying on the [respondent's] silence or failure to deny an allegation, the circumstances were such that the [respondent] should have been expected to make a denial so that his reaction in failing to deny the allegation involved an admission of the truth of the allegation;
(c) the [respondent's] response in respect of any particular allegation was not explicable by such possible explanations as a desire to placate the complainant, or frustration, etc; and
......................................................................
77. ..that it would not be open to the jury to use the evidence as an admission of guilt in relation to any particular count on the indictment. 

54This is a relatively straightforward case of admissions to a sexual relationship between a step-father and his daughter. Her Honour ought to have considered such directions, including reminding the jury of their obligation to find each charge proved beyond reasonable doubt. The failure to take this essential step in the weighing exercise mandated by s 137 constitutes an error of law : R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121 at [68] per Basten JA ; at [177] per Simpson J; at [192] per Blanch J.

55For these reasons ground 2 was upheld.

(3) The Trial Judge Erred in Excluding Evidence of Admissions Pursuant to s 90 of the Evidence Act

56Section 90 of the Evidence Act provides :-

In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence. 


57The operation of s 90 has not been doubted since Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46 ; 239 ALR 204. Relevantly for present purposes, Gummow and Hayne JJ explained the role that s 90 plays within the Act as a whole. At [107] ""the central issue"" is identified :-

................ whether the evidence of admissions should not have been admitted because, having regard to the circumstances in which they were made, it would be unfair to the defendant to use the evidence. That question requires consideration of whether there was identified some aspect of the circumstances in which the admissions were made that revealed why the use of the evidence, at the trial of the person who made the admissions, ""would be unfair"". That is, the focus of s 90 falls upon the fairness of using the evidence at trial, not directly upon characterising the circumstances in which the admissions were made, including the means by which the admissions were elicited, as ""fair"" or ""unfair"". 

58What is capable of meeting the description ""unfair"" is incommensurate, depending upon the circumstances of the individual case. Whilst Justices Gummow and Hayne rejected issues of reliability as a relevant consideration for the purposes of s 90 [at 112], the other members of the Court in Em did not go quite so far. 

59It is abundantly clear from the majority in Em that :-
the mere fact that a conversation was being secretly recorded was not sufficient to make it ""unfair"" to the defendant to admit the recording into evidence. Yet decisions to record conversations with a particular accused person secretly are made because no recording would be possible if that accused person knew of the recording. Thus secret recordings often could not be made without some kind of trickery - a positive representation or conduct suggesting, and leading to the false assumption, that there was no recording being made, a deliberate failure to correct that false assumption, or conduct confirming that false assumption.

per Gleeson CJ and Heydon J at [67]

The appellant's argument, shorn of expressions like ""trick"" and ""trickery"", amounted to the propositions that what the police did, by interviewing the appellant as they did, was to be condemned, and that he had been misled into saying something that could be used in evidence against him. Neither of these propositions, whether taken separately or together, established that use at his trial of the evidence of what he said to police would be unfair. 

Per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [116]

60Returning to the trial judge's reasons for the exclusion of the pretext conversations pursuant to s 90, they may be summarised as follows. The judge accepted that the will of the respondent was overborne, that he was denied his right to silence and was effectively entrapped by the complainant ; that there was no dispute that the respondent left his business card with a school friend of the complainant, requesting that the complainant contact him but there was nothing sinister in that respect, insofar as the respondent was the complainant's adoptive father ; that the conversation was in the nature of an interrogation by the complainant ; that the respondent's statements were elicited at the behest of the police through the complainant as an agent of the State and that the conversation would not have taken place in the form or in the manner in which it did but for the intervention of the State or its agent.

61Having found that the respondent's freedom to choose to speak to the police had ""been impugned, with unfairness to the respondent resulting"", her Honour went on to observe :-

Even if it could be considered that there is no unfairness, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable having regard to prevailing community standards, given the lies, subterfuge and trickery engaged in by the complainant at the instigation of the police in order to have the respondent speak to her in the park when she was wearing a listening device.

62Furthermore, the judge was satisfied that the reliability of the alleged admissions was questionable on the basis of the respondent's hearing and physical impairments.

63Taking these considerations in turn, we do not accept that the respondent's participation in the conversation, including his tone of voice and the content of his exchanges with the complainant, support a finding that his will was relevantly overborne. Her Honour erred in finding to the contrary. It is abundantly clear from the recording itself that the respondent is assertive, sometimes aggressive, sometimes critical of the complainant, and at all times insistent on rejecting the complainant's construction of their relationship where it did not coincide with his own.

64We would also reject the contention that the respondent's freedom to choose to speak or remain silent was in some way compromised. The respondent knew that the complainant wished to speak to him about their past sexual relationship. The content of the telephone conversations confirms that the respondent was aware of the potentially incriminating nature of the discussion which the complainant proposed to have with him, otherwise he would not have expressed a fear in relation to the conversation being recorded. Nonetheless, he chose to meet the complainant in the park and he responded freely to her questions.

65We do not regard the characterisation of the conversation as an interrogation by the complainant to accurately reflect its content and tenor. Whilst the trial judge referred at length to the propositions extracted by McColl JA and Latham J in Pavitt v R [2007] NSWCCA 88 at [70], the judge's finding that the complainant acted as an agent of the State is not borne out by the joint judgment. As Basten JA recently observed in XY at [15], the following appears immediately after those propositions are explored :-

71 ....... we would not readily apply the label of state agent to a complainant speaking to a suspect who had not been charged, nor refused to speak to police. Rather we would look at the whole relationship as revealed by the participants' past history and what is revealed by the actual conversation. It may be relevant to consider whether the police scripted the conversation. 72 ......., in our opinion, with respect, it might be thought that conversations in such circumstances were more likely to be reliable as the suspect would have no occasion to boast, seek to big note him or herself and, to the extent the victim put allegations that the suspect had committed a criminal act vis-à-vis him or her, the suspect would more readily reject the proposition if it was false.73 Police could not anticipate that a suspect would readily make admissions to a person asserting he had committed a criminal act against him. As Giles JA said in Em v Regina (at [68]), ""[o]rdinarily persons do not make admissions against interest unless they are true"".

66Here, the respondent had not been charged prior to the conversations. It is irrelevant whether the judge thought that the police decision to await the outcome of the conversations was ""questionable"". There was no suggestion that the police ""scripted"" the conversation. The whole of the relationship between the respondent and the complainant suggested that the respondent was the dominant personality, who was quite capable of making his own decisions, whether in pain or discomfort or not.

67Similarly, the judge's finding with respect to the reliability of the respondent's statements is against the weight of the evidence for the reasons set out at [42] and [43] above.

68Finally, the judge's alternative basis for exclusion on grounds of public policy set out at [60] above, picks up a reference to that consideration in R v Swaffield ; Pavic v The Queen [1998] HCA 1 ; 192 CLR 159 at [91], which was reiterated in Pavitt at [70]. Two factors bear upon the application of that consideration to the construction of s 90. First, the discussion culminating in [91] in Swaffield occurs in the context of the common law discretion to exclude for unfairness, as distinct from the Evidence Act provisions, which did not then apply in Queensland and Victoria : see Swaffield at [92]. Second, it is important to note that the High Court decision in Em post-dated Swaffield and Pavitt. There is nothing in Em which supports the proposition that such considerations of public policy require the exclusion of pretext conversations when there is no relevant unfairness in the use of the evidence at trial. 

69In that regard, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [120] :-

Nor was the discretion to be engaged by asserting that the conduct of the police is worthy of condemnation for more general (if unspecified) reasons. First, it was not suggested that what the police did was unlawful. Indeed, argument proceeded on the footing that the police recorded their conversation with the appellant under warrants issued under the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW) that permitted them to do just that. Secondly, as to the other limb of s 138, concerning improperly obtained evidence, either what the police did was not improper, or if it is asserted that it was (and again it was not demonstrated in argument why that was so) the significance to be attached to the impropriety of the conduct was to be judged according to the balancing exercise that was called for by s 138. It was not a matter that bore upon the exercise of the discretion under s 90. 

70It is for these reasons that ground 3 was upheld.

		28 July 2014",2013-12-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2762960,Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  On 9 August 2010 the appellant was arraigned in the Supreme Court on an indictment that charged one count of murder (Crimes Act 1900, s 18), and three of perjury (Crimes Act, s 327).  A jury was empanelled and a trial commenced.  On 2 December 2010, the trial judge, Whealy J, directed the jury to return verdicts of not guilty on each of the perjury charges, but left, as alternatives, charges of false swearing, a statutory alternative to perjury.
2The jury trial proceeded over four months.  On 13 December 2010 the jury returned unanimous verdicts of guilty on each of the false swearing charges.  Later on the same day, after having been given directions in accordance with s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 (which permits, in specified circumstances, a majority verdict to be returned), the jury found the appellant guilty of the charge of murder.  On 15 April 2011 Whealy J sentenced the appellant.  In respect of the conviction for murder, he imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 18 years, with a non-parole period of 13 years and 5 months, commencing on 13 December 2010.  In respect of two of the false swearing convictions, he imposed fixed term sentences of imprisonment for 9 months, also to commence on 13 December 2010, and therefore wholly subsumed in the sentence for murder.  In respect of the third offence of false swearing, he imposed a fixed term sentence of imprisonment for 12 months, commencing on 13 February 2011, and therefore accumulated by two months, but nevertheless still wholly subsumed within the murder sentence.
3The appellant appeals against her conviction on the murder charge.  She does not appeal against the verdicts in respect of the false swearing charges.  She has not sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  
The Crown case
4The Crown alleged that, on or about 14 September 1996, the appellant murdered her daughter, Tegan Lane, then 2 days old.  The Crown case was entirely circumstantial.  Although s 18 of the Crimes Act specifies that the requisite state of mind to establish murder may be an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference to human life, it was always unequivocally the Crown case that the appellant's intention was to kill Tegan.  Intention to cause grievous bodily harm and reckless indifference to human life can therefore be put to one side.  
5What follows is an outline of the Crown case.  A more detailed account will be given in our consideration of ground 7 of the appeal, in which it is contended that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  In factual terms, the Crown case was largely uncontroversial.  It is the inferences to be drawn from the factual background that are in dispute.  
6The appellant gave birth to Tegan at Auburn Hospital on 12 September 1996.  Because the appellant had no partner, friend or relative present at the hospital, she was referred to a social worker, Ms Alicia Baltra-Vasquez.  To Ms Baltra-Vasquez the appellant gave a comprehensively false account of her circumstances, saying by way of example, that her parents lived in Perth, and that she and her boyfriend had no close friends in Sydney.  In fact, the appellant's parents lived at Fairlight, the appellant had grown up in Sydney, and she had a circle of friends.  On 14 September 1996, between 11am and 12 noon, the appellant discharged herself from the hospital, taking Tegan with her.  At about 3pm she arrived at the home of her parents at Fairlight.  Tegan was not with her.  Her parents did not know of Tegan's birth.  They had not known that the appellant was pregnant.  On arrival at her parents' home, the appellant met her then boyfriend, Duncan Gillies.  Duncan Gillies was also unaware of the appellant's pregnancy, and unaware of the birth of Tegan.  None of the appellant's friends or acquaintances was aware of the pregnancy.  The appellant's mother drove the couple to a wedding at Manly, where they remained until 11.30pm.  Video footage of the wedding was in evidence, although it throws little, if any, light on the issues.  Nobody appears to have noticed anything untoward about the appellant's appearance or behaviour.  Nevertheless, the Crown case was that, in the hours intervening between the appellant discharging herself from the hospital and her arrival at her parents' home, she killed the child, and in some way disposed of her body.  No body has ever been found.  
7Since the evidence indicates that the appellant's pregnancy had been entirely unknown to anybody but herself, and, presumably, her medical practitioner, no questions were raised about Tegan's whereabouts until October 1999, three years later.  The inquiries that were then made arose because, on 31 May of that year, the appellant gave birth to another child, AJ.  Again, neither her parents nor any of her friends were aware that the appellant was pregnant, or that she had given birth.  She immediately (on 1 June) made contact with the Anglicare Adoption Agency, with a view to surrendering AJ for adoption.  She dealt with a social worker called Virginia Fung.  She told Ms Fung that AJ was her first child.  This was not true.  By that time, the appellant had in fact had two children, Tegan and a daughter to whom we will refer as TR, born in March 1995.  As was the case with the 1996 pregnancy that resulted in the birth of Tegan, neither the appellant's parents nor any of her friends were aware of this pregnancy or the birth of TR.  Similarly, in 1999, none of the appellant's family or friends was aware of the pregnancy, or the birth of AJ.  
8The appellant surrendered TR for adoption.  For the purposes of adoption proceedings in the Supreme Court, the appellant swore two affidavits, the first on 3 April 1995, and the second on 28 April of the same year.  In the first of these affidavits, the appellant deposed that she had been living in a de facto relationship with Duncan Gillies, and that TR was a child of that relationship.  She further deposed that Mr Gillies was then working in the United Kingdom, but had plans to return within 14 days.
9In the second affidavit, she maintained that Mr Gillies was the father of TR, but said that she was separated from him, and that he wished to have no further involvement with the child, or to parent her, and he did not wish to sign an adoption consent form.
10It was not in dispute that each of these affidavits contained false statements.  They gave rise to two of the three perjury (later false swearing) charges.
11In addition to the pregnancies that resulted in the births of TR, Tegan and AJ, the appellant has had two other pregnancies, each of which she had terminated.  
12The arrangements for the adoption of AJ did not proceed smoothly because Ms Fung was not able to satisfy herself (on the information provided by the appellant) that the father of AJ consented to the adoption.  The appellant again gave an account of her circumstances that was false in many respects - for example, she said that she had had antenatal care at a hospital in Brisbane, before coming to Sydney, and prior to that, had lived in London with Duncan Gillies.  None of this was true.  She provided Ms Fung with contact details that were false.  By 18 October the appellant was dealing with another social worker, of the Department of Community Services, John Borovnik, at Katoomba.  In the course of his inquiries, Mr Borovnik discovered that, contrary to what she had told Ms Fung, the appellant had given birth to another child, Tegan.  Mr Borovnik contacted the appellant at a private school where she was engaged as a teacher.  In a telephone conversation she denied having had a baby girl on 12 September 1996.  Mr Borovnik reported Tegan as a missing person to Katoomba Police.
13On 13 September 1999, in relation to the proposed adoption of AJ, the appellant again swore an affidavit.  She identified the father of AJ as ""AW"" and deposed that they had both been living in London when they met, and had had a brief sexual relationship, and had never lived together.  She said that she had no contact with him after his discovery that she was pregnant, and said that she had no means of contacting him.  Again, it was not in dispute that this affidavit contained false statements.  It gave rise to the final perjury charge.  It was the Crown's assertion that no such person as ""AW"" existed.
14An adoption order for AJ was made by the Supreme Court on 30 June 2000.
15Initially, a Detective Kehoe was in charge of the investigation into Tegan's disappearance.  He interviewed the appellant on 14 February 2001.  In October 2002 the investigation was transferred to Detective Gaut.  Detective Gaut spoke to the appellant on 16 October 2002, and interviewed her on 9 May 2003.  That interview was electronically recorded.
16A very careful, thorough and detailed police investigation ensued.  The investigation was initially directed to ascertaining whether Tegan was or was not alive.  In the course of the investigations, in which she was interviewed on three occasions, the appellant gave a number of different versions of what had happened to Tegan after she left Auburn Hospital with her on 14 September 1996.  On 25 October 1999 the appellant sent Ms Fung a facsimile in which she asserted that Tegan was living with a family in Perth, with whom she had not had contact for some time.  
17On 14 February 2001 the appellant told Detective Kehoe that she had given Tegan to her biological father, whom she identified as Andrew Morris.  In October 2002, she identified the father as Andrew Norris.
18These various statements concerning the disposal and whereabouts of Tegan were, in the Crown case, categorised as lies evidencing a consciousness of guilt: see Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193; R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157; 221 A Crim R 309.
19A very extensive Australia wide search by police failed to locate any child who could possibly have been Tegan.  A similarly extensive search failed to locate anybody who could have been the Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris of whom the appellant had spoken.
20On this evidence (and a great deal more that will be detailed below), the Crown case was that Tegan was dead, and that her death had been caused by the appellant.  Since no body had ever been found, the Crown was not in a position to propose a cause of death.  Nor did it have any direct evidence of the state of mind of the appellant.  The intention to kill on which the Crown relied had to be proved, if it were to be proved, by inference.  In this respect, the Crown relied on the evidence of the appellant's history of taking steps to ensure that she did not have the responsibility of caring for a child or children - the evidence of two pregnancy terminations, and two children whom she had given up for adoption (one of the latter post-dating the birth of Tegan).  The trial judge permitted this evidence to be relied on by the Crown as tendency evidence pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995.  There is in the appeal no challenge to that determination.  
The trial
21The senior Crown prosecutor opened the case to the jury in considerable detail, over three days.  On the second day, he said:
""We don't know how or where the accused killed Tegan, or how she disposed of the body.  However, the Auburn Hospital was just a couple of kilometres away from the Australian College of Physical Education at what was then the Homebush Olympics site which at that time in 1996 was surrounded by vast swathes of vacant land, a few building sites and deserted roads, particularly at the weekend.  So there was an opportunity nearby for the accused to find somewhere that was entirely private, which would have given her an opportunity to kill Tegan and dispose of the body."" 
22This prompted a complaint by senior counsel for the appellant.  The complaint was that the observations by the Crown prosecutor were not reflected in any evidence or proposed evidence that had been served on the appellant's legal representatives.  After discussion his Honour indicated that the remark ought to be withdrawn, and the transcript records that the Crown prosecutor began proceedings on the third day by saying:
""Yesterday I said to you that we don't know how or where the accused killed Tegan, or how she disposed of the body.  There is no evidence at all as to what happened to Tegan or the accused, for that matter, during those three hours plus between when she left the hospital before midday, to use her own words, and when she arrived at her parents' house at Fairlight at 3pm.
I think it is fair to say, ladies and gentlemen, that it would not be appropriate for you to speculate about what might have happened during that time.  I ought not to have speculated about the Olympic site because there is no evidence of the Olympic site having been searched.  I would like to correct what I said yesterday in that regard."" 
Notwithstanding that withdrawal, the remarks in the Crown opening are the subject of ground 5 of the appeal.
23At the conclusion of the Crown opening, senior counsel for the appellant opened the defence case.  He encapsulated the defence case in the following terms:
""So, members of the jury, the first and perhaps fundamental difference, dispute or difference, between the defence and the prosecution is that our submission to you will be the Crown can't prove her death, the Crown can't prove the manner of her death, the Crown can't prove that any act was done by the accused in relation to Tegan Lane that either was done when she intended to cause Tegan's death or to do her serious bodily harm."" 
The trial then proceeded. 
24On 22 September the trial judge gave leave, pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act, to the Crown to cross-examine a Crown witness, Peter Clark.  He did not give detailed reasons for this decision, but said:
""Well, my view is that it is an appropriate case to allow it.  The section, I think for the reasons I advocated [during argument] is triggered because of what appears to me to be an inconsistency in the statements [of Mr Clark].  It's not necessary for me to determine the other grounds in section 38.  I take the view that there is nothing in section 192 that would preclude me from giving leave because it's a narrow issue.  It's important to both parties and both parties will have the opportunity to cross-examine the witness.  I think it's better to have the Crown's cross-examination out of the way first."" 
This ruling gives rise to ground 6 of the appeal.
25The appellant did not give or call evidence in the trial.  She had at all times in various interviews with police denied that she had killed Tegan, and maintained that she had given the child either to ""the Perth couple"" or Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris.  
26The evidence in the trial concluded on 16 November 2010.  There was then a good deal of discussion between counsel and the trial judge concerning various issues.  The Crown prosecutor commenced his final address on 22 November.  At the conclusion of the address he said:
""I have said to you that I don't know exactly what [defence counsel] is going to say in his address, but what I would ask you to do is to bear in mind certain questions whilst you are listening to [defence counsel's] address and to see what he says about these particular issues which we would submit to you are particularly pertinent issues to the resolution of this case."" 
27He then posed a series of ten questions, in the following terms:
""Firstly, why did the accused give eight different versions of what happened to Tegan?
Secondly, why did the accused add Tegan to her Medicare membership at the Auburn Hospital if she was about to hand over Tegan to anyone else?
Thirdly, why did it take the accused four hours to get home from the Auburn Hospital to Fairlight, either directly or via Venus Street?
Fourthly, why did the accused tell Detective Kehoe and initially Detective Gaut that she would not be able to find Andrew Norris/Morris's unit in Balmain when she so easily found it in May 2003?
Fifthly, why did the accused wait until May 2003 to look for AndrewNorris/Morris's unit in Balmain?
Sixthly, why did Keli Lane lie to Detective Gaut about Lisa Andreatta of Brisbane knowing Andrew Morris and about the Tegan birth?
Seventhly, why did the accused lie to Detective Gaut about looking for Andrew Norris/Morris's mobile phone number of Venus Street?
Eight, why did the accused lie to Detective Gaut that her circle of friends had changed since the time that she had known Andrew Norris/Morris?
Number nine is, is it just a coincidence that there are so many similarities between Andrew Norris/Morris and [AW]?
Finally, tenthly, why would a natural father of a child not lodge the child's birth registration forms?"" 
The form in which the questions were posed gives rise to ground 2 of the appeal.
28Defence counsel summed up his response in the following terms:
""Point number one is that we do not even know that the victim is dead.  Point number two is if she's dead, we don't know how she died.  There's no scientific evidence at all.  There's nothing. Nobody can tell us anything, not one word in this case.
'We don't know' number three is this, members of the jury: I haven't even got to the investigation and the evidence in the case yet directly.  Number three is if she's dead, that is, Tegan Lane, we don't know who caused the death if anyone did because we don't know.  It could have been an accident and people do terrible things to cover things up.
And you will find out, members of the jury, when his Honour gives you directions in relation to this, that these next matters are absolutely as critical as the first point which we suggest is 'we don't know'.  We do not even know that Tegan Lane is dead.
Point number four: If Tegan Lane is dead we don't know that it was the deliberate act of Keli Lane that caused her death.
Number five: We don't know that if Tegan is dead and the ability [sic - ? act] of Keli Lane caused her death, we don't know that it was done with the intention to kill her."" 
29The trial judge then summed up in a manner that has not, except in one respect, attracted criticism.  The exception is set out in ground 1 of the appeal.
30The jury retired to consider its verdicts at 11.10am on 6 December 2010 (a Monday).  Deliberations continued over the whole of that week.  On the following Monday, 13 December, one member of the jury sent a note to the judge advising that the jury had reached unanimous verdicts on some, but not all, counts on the indictment, and that a unanimous verdict was unlikely in relation to one count.  After discussion with counsel, the judge recalled the jury and ultimately was assured by the foreperson that the jury had reached unanimous verdicts in relation to the three counts of false swearing, and that it was unlikely that they would reach a unanimous verdict on the murder count.  The judge then took those verdicts, each of which was guilty.  The trial judge gave a direction in accordance with s 55F of the Jury Act.  Within a very short time the jury returned with a verdict of guilty on the murder charge.  
The appeal
31Initially, eight grounds of appeal were pleaded, in the following terms:
""1.  The Trial Judge erred in failing to leave the alternative count of manslaughter to the jury.
2.  The trial miscarried by reason of the prejudice occasioned by the Crown Prosecutor.  In particular that he reversed the onus of proof in his closing address by positing a series of questions that he stated the defence had to answer.
3.  A separate trial application should have been made by Trial Counsel in respect to the perjury/false swearing charges.
4.  The Trial Judge should have directed the Jury that the charge of Infanticide was an alternative.
5.  The trial miscarried by the failure of the Trial Judge to discharge the Jury after the Crown Prosecutor made prejudicial remarks in his opening address.
6.  The Trial Judge erred in granting an application pursuant to Section 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 made by the Crown Prosecutor to have Mr Peter Jerry Clark cross examined due to him making an allegedly inconsistent statement.
7.  The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
8.  Failure of the Trial Counsel to ask for a direction that The Applicant had suffered prejudice as a result of the delay in prosecution.""
During the course of the hearing of the appeal, ground 4 was abandoned.
Ground 1: should the trial judge have left an alternative count of manslaughter to the jury?
32During the entire course of the trial there was never any suggestion that an alternative verdict of manslaughter ought to have been left to the jury.  Whether an accused person seeks such a direction sometimes hinges upon tactical considerations.  It should not be assumed that it is always to the advantage, or perceived to be to the advantage, of a person accused of murder to have the jury given the option of returning an alternative verdict of guilty of manslaughter.  That may be seen to be offering the jury a middle path between conviction of murder and acquittal.  Such a case was Mraz v The Queen [1955] HCA 59; 93 CLR 493 (see below).  A person accused of murder may perceive an advantage in casting upon the jury the responsibility of determining whether he or she is guilty of murder, or is to be acquitted, with no middle course available.  Although the tactical considerations had added force in the days when the penalty following a conviction for murder was or could be death, the consideration, while diminished somewhat, still remains valid.  In Mraz, in a joint judgment, Williams, Webb and Taylor JJ said:
""As those who are familiar with murder trials well know, if the only alternatives before a jury are acquittal and sentence of death, there is a strong tendency to shrink from pronouncing a verdict which leads to death ... Whilst, perhaps, the like comment may not now be made with quite the same force it is clear that the appellant was entitled to have the issues decided upon the graver charge and, to us, it seems quite wrong to attempt to justify the verdict of manslaughter, returned in the circumstances of this case, by the observation that the jury, upon an issue of manslaughter which they were invited to consider, must have reached conclusions on issues of fact which would have required them, if properly instructed, to have returned a verdict of murder.  It is, of course, quite possible to say that the same conclusions on these issues of fact must have led the jury to find the appellant guilty of murder if they had been properly instructed.  But it would be ignoring the realities of the matter to assume that if they had been required to consider whether they should convict the appellant of murder or acquit him they would have reached the same conclusions."" (italics added) 
33Fullagar J said:
""In many murder trials the question whether the possibility of a verdict of manslaughter should be raised presents a serious problem to counsel for the accused.  Probably in most cases it is regarded as disadvantageous to the accused to suggest the possibility of a verdict of manslaughter.  A jury which would hesitate to convict of murder may be only too glad to take a middle course which is offered to them.  The position is well illustrated by Ross v The King [[1922] HCA 4; 30 CLR 246] ...  In the same case in the High Court Higgins J. said:- 'I thoroughly concur with the view put by the Supreme Court that ""the absence of any express direction as to manslaughter was an omission, as far as it went, entirely in the prisoner's favour"".  As those who are familiar with murder trials well know, if the only alternatives before a jury are acquittal and sentence of death, there is a strong tendency to shrink from pronouncing a verdict which leads to death' ... In the present case the jury may well have hesitated long before convicting the appellant of murder, and it is very far indeed from clear that the misdirection did not operate to his grave disadvantage.  In such circumstances it is impossible to say that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.  These 'too favourable' directions can only too often be veritable gifts from the Greeks.""
Mraz was a rare case in which it was held to have been erroneous to leave to the jury an alternative verdict of manslaughter.  At trial, Mraz was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter.  That verdict was set aside and a verdict of acquittal entered.
34The italicised passage from the joint judgment was quoted by Gleeson CJ and Gummow J in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at [14], with the comment:
""17  When, in Mraz, the majority referred to 'ignoring the realities of the matter', one of the contemporary realities to which they were referring was the death penalty.  That was why, tactically, defence counsel might prefer to conduct a homicide case on a 'murder-or-nothing' basis.  The death penalty has gone, but there are other, perhaps equally influential, realities.  This is an age of concern for the victims of violent crime, and their relatives.  To adapt the words of Fullagar J, a jury may hesitate to acquit, and may be glad to take a middle course which is offered to them.""
35That it may not be to the advantage of an accused person to have an alternative verdict of manslaughter left was also specifically recognised by Kirby J in Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1.  His Honour set out a series of propositions of which the eighth and last was:
""83  Eighthly, great care on the part of a trial judge is needed to ensure that, by posing the possibility of a verdict of manslaughter, the judge does not effectively deprive an accused of a verdict of acquittal ...""
The duty of a trial judge
36The duty of a judge in a jury trial is:
to explain to the jury the relevant law (without excursions into interesting but inapplicable legal principles);
to place that explanation in the context of the facts of the case;
to explain how the law applies to the facts of the particular case;
to give these explanations in the context of the issues in the particular case;
to identify the issues in the case as they have been fought between the parties; and
to direct the jury on what those issues are.
The above propositions are drawn from the decision of the High Court in Alford v Magee [1952] HCA 3; 85 CLR 437 at 466.  They have been adopted on many occasions since, relevantly for present purposes in Stevens v The Queen [2005] HCA 65; 227 CLR 319 by Gleeson CJ and Heydon J.  See also Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 87 ALJR 434 at [31].  In Stevens, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J were in dissent as to the outcome of the case, but the application of Alford v Magee principles is not controversial.  Their Honours went on to say, at [18]:
""A summing-up in a murder trial is not meant to take the form of an essay on the law of homicide, with points given for comprehensiveness.  Juries decide issues of fact, not law.  The task of the trial judge is to formulate for the decision of the jury the issues of fact which they need to resolve in order to return a verdict.  In formulating those issues, the judge may think it appropriate to refer to legal principles by way of explanation, but the task of the jury is to decide facts ...""
37It is clear from the principles stated in Alford v Magee and the passage extracted from Stevens that ""the issues"" are those which emerge from the way the trial has been conducted; that is, definition of the issues depends upon the conduct of the trial by the parties.  That the jury had been adequately directed on the issues in the trial, as so defined, was central to the ultimate outcome in Huynh.  
38As at 1954, that was equally the case with respect to charges of murder.  In Beavan v The Queen [1954] HCA 41; 92 CLR 660, the Court (Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Webb, Fullagher and Taylor JJ) said:
""Upon an indictment for murder where the proofs suffice to justify a verdict of murder, but on no view of the evidence which might reasonably be adopted, would the crime amount to manslaughter and not murder, and counsel for the prisoner has not suggested to the jury the possibility of their returning a verdict of manslaughter, the judge is under no duty to inform the jury that it is within their power to find a verdict of manslaughter, unless the jury ask a question upon the subject. In that case it will usually be incumbent upon the judge to inform them that upon an indictment for murder it is within the province of a jury to find a verdict of manslaughter; but it is proper for him to add an expression of his opinion that in no view of the evidence which the jury might reasonably take are findings of fact open that fall short of murder but amount to manslaughter.""
39Since 1971, with respect to charges of murder, however, there is an important qualification to the Alford v Magee principles.  Notwithstanding Mraz, it is now well established that, where a person is on trial for murder, and where the evidence in the trial is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter, it is the duty of the trial judge to direct the jury of its entitlement to acquit the accused of murder and return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.  That is so even if the accused person does not seek such a direction, and even where the accused person actively opposes the direction.
40That has been the position since the decision of the High Court in Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107.  In that case, Barwick CJ, for example, said, at 117:
""... There is no doubt that the course taken by counsel for the appellant at the trial contributed substantially to the form of the summing up.  If the trial had been of a civil cause, it might properly be said that the trial judge had put to the jury the issues which had arisen between the parties.  But this was not a civil trial ... Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interest of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law.  This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part.
Here, counsel for the defence did not merely not rely on the matters now sought to be raised; he abandoned them and expressly confined the defence to the matters he did raise.  However, in my opinion, this course did not relieve the trial judge of the duty to put to the jury with adequate assistance any matters on which the jury, upon the evidence, could find for the accused ..."" (italics added)
In the same case, Menzies J said:
""An appeal court is not, of course, concerned to investigate the actual basis upon which a jury has returned its verdict, but the events which I have outlined emphasize that the conduct of a case by counsel does not impose any limit upon the course which the jury may take and cannot make superfluous a full and accurate direction covering all that must be proved before a verdict of guilty can be returned ...
... Furthermore it is always in the power of a jury to acquit and that power cannot be denied ... Moreover, counsel for the defence cannot effectively disclaim a defence open to the accused upon the evidence.  The judge must submit that defence to the jury. Even less can counsel concede a matter of law to the disadvantage of the accused.  The law is always for the judge as counsel for the defence rightly told the jury ..."" (italics added)
Windeyer J said:
""... Of course this appeal cannot depend upon the form which advocacy took or upon the issue counsel presented to the jury ...""
Finally, Owen J said:
""... On several occasions during his address to the jury the solicitor appearing for the appellant disclaimed any suggestion that his client should be acquitted of both murder and manslaughter.  He asked the jury to acquit his client on the charge of murder and to return a verdict of guilty on the charge of manslaughter.  The case was thus fought on the basis that the only question was whether the appellant was guilty of murder or not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and it was in this way that the learned trial judge charged the jury ...""
41In that case, the verdict of guilty of murder was set aside and, by majority, a verdict of guilty of manslaughter was substituted.  The Court divided as to the outcome, and as to the reasoning processes.  The commonality is in the passages extracted above - the duty of the trial judge, notwithstanding tactical or other decisions taken by an accused or counsel, to give the jury directions as to verdicts available on the evidence.  It will be noted that, in the passages extracted, and in the foregoing statement at [39], words to the effect of ""on the evidence"" have been italicised.  They are a critical element of the principle. 
42This Court has concisely stated the current position, in four propositions, as follows:
""(1)  Manslaughter cannot be left for the determination of the jury as an alternative verdict in a murder trial unless there is evidence to support such a verdict (or unless the case on manslaughter is 'viable').
(2)  However, if in a murder trial the jury nevertheless returns a verdict of manslaughter where there is no evidence to support it, the judge may request them to reconsider the matter but, if they persist in that verdict, the judge must accept it.
(3)  If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, the judge must leave that issue to the jury - notwithstanding that it has not been raised by any party, and even if a party objects (or all parties object) to the issue being left to the jury.
(4)(a)  If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, and if the judge has not left that issue (for whatever reason), there has been an error of law. 
     (b)  Subject to the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW), r 4 (see [99]-[100]), the appellant is entitled to a new trial unless the Crown establishes that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
     (c)  In determining whether there has been such a substantial miscarriage, it is not permissible to reason that the jury's verdict of guilty of murder at the first trial excludes any consideration of the alternative verdict of manslaughter at the new trial."" (italics added)
R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; 64 NSWLR 527 per Hunt AJA, Buddin and Hoeben JJ.
43The outcome of this ground of appeal hinges on whether there was, in the evidence, material capable of supporting a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.  It does not depend upon whether there was evidence capable of supporting a verdict of guilty of murder.  That question arises in relation to ground 7.  The mere fact that the jury has found all of the elements of murder proved does not, of itself, obviate the need to consider whether manslaughter was a viable alternative.  If it were, and manslaughter was not left, the appeal must be allowed.  Determination of whether there was, on the facts of this case, evidence capable of supporting a verdict of manslaughter, or that a verdict of manslaughter was ""viable"", calls, first, for an examination of the law relating to murder and manslaughter.



Homicide
44It is necessary to understand how murder and manslaughter fit together.  The generic offence is homicide: R v Downs (1985) 3 NSWLR 312 at 327, per Smart J.  Murder and manslaughter are species of the generic offence.  Murder is defined in s 18 of the Crimes Act as follows:
""18  Murder and manslaughter defined(1) (a)  Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.(b)  Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.
(2) (a)  No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.(b)  No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only."" (italics added)
45Section 18(1)(b) makes clear that murder and manslaughter are mutually exclusive.  If a killing is murder it is not manslaughter.  It is murder if it is accompanied by the requisite state of mind.  The same conduct cannot constitute both offences.  That is not to say that the evidence in any given case may not be so interpreted as to give rise to a verdict of either.  But that is because of the inferences to be drawn from the evidence.  If the requisite state of mind for murder is not proved, it is appropriate to consider whether, notwithstanding that murder has not been proved, the evidence may nevertheless establish the lesser offence of manslaughter. 
46It will be seen that while a detailed definition is given in s 18 of the circumstances in which a killing will be categorised as murder, there is no such definition of what constitutes manslaughter.  For that, it is necessary to go to the common law, to which we will shortly come.
47Speaking of the provisions of the Criminal Code of Queensland (""the Queensland Code"") with respect to homicide, in R v Barlow [1997] HCA 19; 188 CLR 1, Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ said:
""The scheme of the Code's provisions relating to culpable homicide is to define unlawful killing, to divide the categories of unlawful killing into murder and manslaughter, to define the offence of murder by reference to the specific intent with which the fatal act must be committed or the fatal omission must be made or by reference to the circumstances which must accompany the commission of that act or the making of that omission, and then to define the offence of manslaughter as consisting of the residual cases of unlawful killing."" (footnotes omitted)
Although the form of the Queensland Code provisions is very different, the substance of that passage applies equally to s 18 of the Crimes Act.
48Section 18 defines the crime of murder by reference to the specific intent with which the act or omission causing death was committed, and by reference to other circumstances that render a killing murder.  (The other circumstances are the commission of a relevant crime.  This gives rise to the offence known as ""constructive murder"" or ""felony murder"".  That has no application to the present case and it can be put to one side.)  The definition of murder derives from the common law, as stated in Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, 1st edition (1877) as follows:
""Art 223: ... Murder is unlawful homicide with malice aforethought.  Malice aforethought means ... (a) An intention to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, any person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not; (b) Knowledge that the act which causes death will probably cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, some person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused ...""
See also The Queen v Crabbe [1985] HCA 22; 156 CLR 464 at 467-468.
49In Crabbe, the High Court adopted a definition of murder as ""unlawful homicide with malice aforethought"", and of ""malice aforethought"" as either an intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm, or knowledge that the act that causes death will probably cause death or grievous bodily harm.  The High Court emphasised that knowledge of death or grievous bodily harm as the probable consequence of the act (or omission) is sufficient to constitute the mental element for murder.  That is because a person who kills while in possession of that knowledge is equally blameworthy as the person who does an act causing death with the express intention of doing so.  The Court noted, but did not adopt (or reject), a view that to do an act that causes death knowing that death or grievous bodily harm is the probable consequence of the act is sufficient to give rise to an inference that the person intended those consequences (at p 469). 
50As mentioned above, there is no statutory definition of the offence of manslaughter.  There are two categories of manslaughter - voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter: see Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313 (at p 333 [49]); R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 at [2].  Voluntary manslaughter is a creature of statute; it is committed where a killing which would otherwise amount to murder is reduced by reason of some circumstance provided by statute - provocation (Crimes Act, s 23), substantial impairment by abnormality of mind (Crimes Act, s 23A) or excessive self defence (Crimes Act, s 421).  For voluntary manslaughter to be proved, it is necessary that the Crown first prove all of the elements of murder; it is then necessary, in the case of s 23A, that the accused prove something additional: that, at the time of the acts or omissions causing death, his or her capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his or her actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind resulting from an underlying condition, and that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.  With respect to s 23, if there is evidence that the act causing death was done or omitted to be done under provocation (as defined) the onus is on the prosecution to prove something additional - that the act was not done under provocation.  Similarly, with respect to s 421, if the defence of self defence is raised, the onus is on the prosecution to prove that the act causing death was not done in self defence.  The essential thing is that, before voluntary manslaughter can even be considered, all of the elements of murder must be proved.
51That is not so in the case of involuntary manslaughter.  Involuntary manslaughter is the product of the common law.  There are two categories so recognised - manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, and manslaughter by criminal negligence.  The same conduct may give rise to liability under either category: Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334 at [6].
52It is involuntary manslaughter that, it is contended on behalf of the appellant, ought to have been left to the jury in this case.  The contention is that both categories of involuntary manslaughter were available and ought to have been left.  It will be necessary to examination that contention in some detail.  
53Before doing so, it is necessary to identify the specific features of each of the two categories of involuntary manslaughter.
Manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act
54In Wilson, Mason CJ, Toohey, Guadron and McHugh JJ described this category of manslaughter as ""an uncertain area of the law, reflecting a divergence between Australian and English authorities as to the degree of danger which must exist"".  Wilson settled the law of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act for Australia.
55An unlawful act is one which is contrary to the criminal law: Wilson, per Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ (at p 335).  A dangerous act is one carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson, per Mason CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ (at p 333), adopting (with one qualification - the deletion of the description ""really"" before ""serious injury"") the test specified in R v Holzer [1968] VR 481.  It is no part of this offence that the accused intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm; if that were the case, the offence would be murder.  It is necessary, however, that the Crown prove that the accused intended to commit the act that caused death.  It is also necessary that the Crown prove that a reasonable person in the position of the accused, performing the act which the accused performed, would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to that appreciable risk.  In that respect, the test of dangerousness is objective.  
56In Lavender at [40], Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said, in a joint judgment:
""40  ... The decision in Wilson v The Queen establishes that this is a form of manslaughter [that is, manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act] which exists because of the importance which the law attaches to human life.  It turns upon an objective test.  The only relevant intent of the accused is an intent to do the act that was unlawful and dangerous and that inadvertently caused death.  A description of an act as dangerous requires consideration of whether a reasonable person would have realised that he or she was exposing another to an appreciable risk of really serious injury ...""
See also Burns at [75].
57In order to sustain a conviction of this category of manslaughter, it is necessary that the Crown prove:
(i)that the act causing death was a breach of the criminal law;
(ii)that the act causing death was one that carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury to another or others;
(iii)that the act causing death was one that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realized carried such a risk; and
(iv)that the accused person intended to commit the act that caused death.
Manslaughter by criminal negligence
58As in the case of the tort of negligence, the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence takes as a starting point the existence of a duty of care owed by the accused to the victim: see The Duty of Care in Gross Negligence Manslaughter, Jonathan Herring and Elaine Palser [2007] Crim Law Rev 24; see Justins v R [2010] NSWCCA 242; 79 NSWLR 544, per Simpson J at [93]. 
59What constitutes manslaughter by criminal negligence was stated by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Nydam v R [1977] VR 430.  The Court said:
""No doubt manslaughter does involve mens rea.  But to use the language of Lord Salmon in Newbury's Case [Director of Public Prosecutions v Newbury [1976] UKHL 3; [1976] 2 WLR 918, at p 923], the necessary intent is no more than an intent to do the acts which constitute the crime.  The problem is to formulate the requirement in terms which will enable the jury to determine whether the case is one of murder by recklessness or manslaughter by criminal negligence.  The requisite mens rea in the latter crime does not involve a consciousness on the part of the accused of the likelihood of his act's causing death or serious bodily harm to the victim or persons placed in similar relationship as the victim was to the accused.  The requisite mens rea is, rather, an intent to do the act which, in fact, caused the death of the victim, but to do that act in circumstances where the doing of it involves a great falling short of the standard of care required of a reasonable man in the circumstances and a high degree of risk or likelihood of the occurrence of death or serious bodily harm if that standard of care was not observed, that is to say, such a falling short and such a risk as to warrant punishment under the criminal law.  This formulation proceeds on the footing that the accused man did not in fact advert (although a reasonable man would have adverted) to the probability that death or grievous bodily harm wound ensue.  It adopts the view of Menzies, J, in Pemble v R, supra, and of Lord Hailsham in Hyam v Director of Public Prosecutions [[1974] UKHL 2; [1975] AC 55, at p 79] that if the accused knows that the act is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, and consciously accepts that risk, it is murder.  The formulation is consistent with the objective test of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act approved by the House of Lords in DPP v Newbury, supra.""
The Full Court concluded:
""In order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence, it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment.""
60The latter formulation has been expressly approved by the High Court: see Lavender at [136]; Wilson at p 333 [49]; Burns at [19], per French CJ.
61As was pointed out in Justins, it is necessary that there be identity of the act or omission constituting the breach of duty of care, and the act or omission causing death; that is, it is essential that the act or omission that amounts to a breach of duty is the act or omission that causes death (Justins, at [97]).
62Accordingly, to sustain a conviction of this category of manslaughter, it is necessary that the Crown prove:
(i)that the accused owed the victim a duty of care;
(ii)that the accused acted or omitted to act in such a way as to constitute a breach of that duty of care;
(iii)that that act or omission caused the death of the deceased; and
(iv)that the breach of duty was of such magnitude that it merited criminal punishment.
63The above discussion, with respect to both categories of involuntary manslaughter, assumes two things - the death of the victim, and that the death was caused by an act (or, in the case of manslaughter by criminal negligence, an omission) of the accused.  In the present case, both of those elements had to be proved, if they were to be proved, by inference.  The verdict of guilty of murder establishes that the jury accepted that both were proved beyond reasonable doubt.
The elements of the offences of murder, manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, and manslaughter by criminal negligence
MurderManslaughter by unlawful and dangerous actManslaughter by criminal negligence1. Death of the victim1. Death of the victim1. Death of the victim2. Death caused by the act or omission of the accused2. Death caused by the act of the accused2. Death caused by the act or omission of the accused3. The accused acted or omitted to act with the relevant state of mind - that is:● intention to kill;● intention to do grievous bodily harm;● reckless indifference to human life3. (i) The act was unlawful (that is, criminal);(ii) The act was dangerous3. (i) The accused owed a duty of care to the victim;(ii) breach of that duty (by act or omission);(iii) identity between the act or omission constituting breach of duty, and act or omission causing death4. The accused intended to do the act that caused death4. The breach of duty was so grave as to merit criminal punishment5. A reasonable person in the position of the accused would have appreciated that the act was one that, in the circumstances, exposed another or others to risk of serious injury
64One feature that distinguishes murder and manslaughter by criminal negligence on the one hand from manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act on the other is that, in the case of former, conviction may result from proof that death was caused either by act or omission; as is apparent from the terminology, manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act may only be established by proof of a specific act.  And the act must be identified with precision.  That is because, for conviction, the act must be shown to have the requisite characteristics - that it is unlawful (that is a breach of the criminal law), and dangerous, in the sense explained above.  If the act causing death is not identified with precision, it is not possible to ascribe to it those characteristics.  
65There is a limit on the extent to which an omission may be relied upon to establish either murder or manslaughter.  In Burns, the plurality said:
""97  Criminal liability does not fasten on the omission to act, save in the case of an omission to do something that a person is under a legal obligation to do.  As a general proposition, the law does not impose an obligation on individuals to rescue or otherwise to act to preserve human life.  Such an obligation may be imposed by statute or contract or because of the relationship between individuals.  The relationships of parent and child, and doctor and patient, are recognised as imposing a duty of this kind ..."" (internal citations omitted)
66The question which arises under this ground of appeal is whether, in the circumstances of this case, either category of manslaughter ought to have been left to the jury.  The answer to that question depends upon whether there was, on the evidence, in either case, a ""viable"" alternative verdict.  Manslaughter ought not to be left if there is no evidence to support such a verdict: Ross v The King [1922] HCA 4; 30 CLR 246; Kanaan at [50].  Indeed to leave an alternative verdict of manslaughter to the jury may be to do a disservice to the person accused, as illustrated by Kirby J in Gillard (at [83]).
67Before turning to that specific question, it is useful to have regard to the practical application of the Pemble principles - the various occasions on which consideration has been given to when an alternative verdict of manslaughter ought to have been, but was not, left to the jury, and the rationale for the decisions.  (We have already adverted to Mraz, where the converse was held - manslaughter was, but ought not to have been, left.)  In every case, the factual basis is far removed from the present case.
Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107
68We start with a reference to Pemble.  Pemble is well known and widely cited for the propositions extracted at some length above.  However, it is useful to examine the facts of that case, and the background to the statement of those propositions.
69Pemble's trial took place in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in 1970.  Pemble was charged with the murder of a woman with whom he had been living in a de facto relationship.  The victim terminated the relationship.  The victim died as a result of the discharge, admittedly by Pemble of a rifle.  After a one day trial in the Supreme Court, the jury convicted of murder.  The High Court, by majority, set aside the conviction of murder, and substituted a verdict of manslaughter.  The factual basis for that determination was drawn from statements made by Pemble to investigating police after the death, and a statement made by him in court.  Those statements were to the following effect.
70After the victim terminated the relationship, her father was, to Pemble, highly critical of her conduct, and could be said to have incited Pemble at least to anger, and violence against her.  Pemble took a rifle to a local hotel, where he unexpectedly encountered the victim.  In statements made to police and in court, he claimed not to have known that the rifle was loaded.  He called to the victim, then stumbled.  The rifle discharged, killing the victim.
71Two important assertions are contained in this outline - that Pemble did not know that the rifle was loaded, and that, when he called the name of the victim, he stumbled.  He said that he had no intention of discharging the rifle.  Implicit in this was an assertion that the discharge of the firearm was accidental.
72From the start of the trial, on his behalf it was accepted that he bore criminal responsibility for the death.  His counsel opened and closed to the jury that the case was one of murder or manslaughter.  He repeatedly invited the jury to reject the count of murder and convict of manslaughter.  Pursuant to an express request by counsel, the trial judge directed the jury (in terms that would not suffice under present requirements and were held by Barwick CJ to have been inadequate) that they could bring in a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.  What was not put, by either counsel or by the trial judge, in express terms, was the defence of accidental death was implicit in Pemble's account of events.  
73Pemble was therefore not a case in which it was said that the alternative verdict of manslaughter ought to have been, but was not, left.  Nevertheless, the judgments bear heavily upon related questions.
74Barwick CJ, McTiernan J and Windeyer J held that it would not have been reasonably open to the jury, on the evidence, to acquit Pemble by reason of accident.  Barwick CJ held, however, that the direction as to manslaughter was inadequate.  There were other defects in the summing up.  Accordingly, his Honour reached the conclusion that the conviction for murder ought to be set aside, and a verdict of guilty of manslaughter substituted.  McTiernan J and Windeyer J essentially agreed.  The Court did not specify which category of involuntary manslaughter ought to have been left.  Given the circumstances outlined above, it is feasible that either manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by criminal negligence, was open.
75Menzies J and Owen J considered that the accounts given by Pemble left open the possibility of accident, and the consequent possibility of acquittal.  They therefore would have set aside the verdict of guilty of murder and ordered a new trial.
Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414
76In Gilbert, the issue arose in an indirect fashion.  Gilbert, his brother and another man were jointly tried in the Supreme Court of Queensland on a charge of murder.  The applicable law was the Queensland Code.  Gilbert's brother was alleged to have been the principal perpetrator of the offence; Gilbert was said to be liable by reason of s 7(c) of the Queensland Code, which provided for accessorial liability.  Gilbert's state of knowledge as to what his brother intended to do to the victim was critical.   If he knew that his brother intended to inflict at least grievous bodily harm on the victim, then, by reason of s 7(c) of the Queensland Code, Gilbert was, as was his brother, guilty of murder.  His case, however, was that all he knew was that his brother intended to assault the victim.  If the jury accepted that as a reasonable possibility, Gilbert was guilty of manslaughter.  (This, presumably, was because he would have been an accessory to an unlawful and dangerous act.)  Acting on the perceived understanding of the Queensland Code at the time, the trial judge did not leave manslaughter to the jury.  The case went to the jury on the basis that he was guilty of murder, or should be acquitted.
77After the Gilbert trial, the High Court delivered judgment in Barlow.  This decision established that, contrary to the previous understanding, an alternative verdict of manslaughter ought to have been left to the jury.  So much was accepted when Gilbert appealed to the Queensland Court of Appeal (R v Gilbert [1998] QCA 13).  The question which then arose was whether, by reason of s 668E(1) of the Queensland Code, the appeal ought nevertheless be dismissed.  Section 668E is the Queensland equivalent of the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, pursuant to which, notwithstanding established error, an appeal might be dismissed if the court considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.  By majority, the Court of Appeal applied the proviso and dismissed Gilbert's appeal. Gilbert appealed by special leave to the High Court, where the same issue was debated.
78The proviso proceeds on the assumption that error has been established.  The question posed by the proviso is whether, notwithstanding the error, the appellate court considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.  In the circumstances of Gilbert, that question was to be answered by reference to another question - whether the jury, properly instructed, would necessarily have returned a verdict of guilty of murder (at [19]-[20]).  It was in the course of the consideration of that question that the members of the High Court made observations relevant to the issue now before this Court.
79Three members of the Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow J and Callinan J) concluded that, on the evidence, a jury properly instructed could have ""failed to reach the state of satisfaction necessary for a conviction of murder"".  They therefore answered in the negative the question whether a verdict of guilty of murder was inevitable.  McHugh J and Hayne J would have dismissed the appeal, McHugh J saying:
""26  Where a trial judge correctly directs the jury as to the essential elements of the crime charged, a verdict of guilty necessarily amounts to a finding of every essential element of the crime, and the verdict cannot be set aside on the ground that the trial judge should have directed the jury that on the evidence they could convict the accused of a lesser offence ...
27  ... in the present case, the jury could not as a matter of law, fact or conscience find the appellant guilty of manslaughter.  The jury's verdict negatives the essential facts that the appellant had to rely on to obtain a verdict of manslaughter ...""
80The basis on which the various members of the Court reached their conclusions is interesting.  The division turns upon the extent to which a jury is taken to apply intellectual rigour in applying itself to its task, and acting on the directions it has been given, and its reasoning process.  For example, McHugh J said:
28  Consequently, the error of the learned trial judge ... had no causal effect on the jury's verdict.  Even if the trial judge had directed the jury that they could find manslaughter, they could not have found him guilty of manslaughter given the findings that are necessarily implicit in their verdict of murder.  The legal error of the learned trial judge, therefore, did not constitute a miscarriage of justice.  The appellant would have been convicted of murder even if the jury had been directed that they could find him guilty of manslaughter and not murder.
29  The argument for the appellant would have it that this is too legalistic a way to look at the case.  If manslaughter had been left as an issue, so the argument runs, the jury might have convicted him of manslaughter notwithstanding that their verdict necessarily shows that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the 'facts' upon which the 'defence' of manslaughter depended were not true.  In my opinion, this argument should be rejected as a matter of legal policy as well as legal principle and established authority.
30  The argument for the appellant is a claim that this Court should proceed on one of two bases, each of which necessarily involves an assumption that, if manslaughter had been left as an issue, the jury might have disregarded their sworn duty to give a verdict in accordance with the evidence.  The first assumption is that, if manslaughter had been left, the jury might have convicted of manslaughter even though they knew, because of the trial judge's directions, that the appellant was guilty of murder.  The second assumption is that the jurors were not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that his brother intended to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm on [the victim], that they knew therefore that he was not guilty of murder, but that they nevertheless convicted him of murder rather than acquit him and see him go free.  In my respectful opinion, as a matter of legal policy, no court of justice can entertain either assumption."" (italics in original)
81Hayne J, who concurred with McHugh J's view that the appeal should be dismissed, expressed similar views.  His Honour said:
""46  The issue that lies behind the question the parties identified is, however, fundamental: whether an appellate court can conclude that there may have been a miscarriage of justice because the jury might have disobeyed the instructions they were given in reaching the verdict they did.  In the language of the cases dealing with the proviso in criminal appeal statutes, can it be said that, because the jury might have disobeyed what the judge told them, the accused lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him?
47  The essence of the appellant's contention in this Court was that the jury should have been told to consider whether the appellant may not have known that his co-accused intended to kill or do grievous bodily harm to the victim (but, mistakenly, thought some lesser assault was intended).  It was suggested that, had the jury been given such a direction, they might have felt able to choose a middle course between convicting the appellant of murder and acquitting him of any responsibility for what was done to the victim ...
48  ... it is of the first importance to understand that, consistent with the trial judge's directions, the jury could not have returned the verdict they did without being satisfied to the requisite standard that 'at some time before arrival at the scene [the appellant] realised that there was an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm, and knowing that that was the intention, adhered to the plan by continuing to drive [his co-accused to their destination] ... so that that intention might be carried out'.  If not satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt, the judge directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty of murder.  By their verdict, then, the jury necessarily rejected the possibility that the appellant held the mistaken belief that underpinned the appellant's argument in this Court.  Had they concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant held that belief, the judge's directions obliged them to acquit the appellant of murder.
49  It follows that the contention that the appellant lost a chance of acquittal of murder that was fairly open to him because the jury were not told that they should consider whether he had some different and less precise knowledge of the intentions of his co-accused must be rejected.  It is a contention that assumes that the jury disregarded the judge's direction that the appellant could be convicted of murder only if the jury were satisfied to the requisite standard that the appellant knew of the murderous intent of one or both of his co-accused."" (internal citations omitted, italics in original)
82Gleeson CJ and Gummow J recounted the arguments put on behalf of Gilbert, and said:
""13  The system of criminal justice, as administered by appellate courts, requires the assumption, that, as a general rule, juries understand, and follow, the directions they are given by trial judges.  It does not involve the assumption that their decision-making is unaffected by matters of possible prejudice.
[Their Honours referred to the reasoning in Mraz that is set out above.]
16  These statements are inconsistent with the notion that an appellate court must assume, on the part of a jury, a mechanistic approach to the task of fact-finding, divorced from a consideration of the consequences.  Indeed, juries are ordinarily asked to return a general verdict.  They make their findings of fact in the context of instructions as to the consequences of such findings, and for the purpose of returning a verdict which expresses those consequences.
17  When, in Mraz, the majority referred to 'ignoring the realities of the matter', one of the contemporary realities to which they were referring was the death penalty.  That was why, tactically, defence counsel might prefer to conduct a homicide case on a 'murder-or-nothing' basis.  The death penalty has gone, but there are other, perhaps equally influential, realities.  This is an age of concern for the victims of violent crime, and their relatives.  To adapt the words of Fullagar J, a jury may hesitate to acquit, and may be glad to take a middle course which is offered to them.""
83Callinan J referred to another decision of the High Court (Gammage v The Queen [1969] HCA 68; 122 CLR 444), in which Barwick CJ said (at p 451):
""... They have no right, in my opinion, to return a verdict of manslaughter where they are satisfied of murder.  But, as I have said, persistence by them in returning another verdict must ultimately result in the acceptance of that verdict.  In that sense, but in no other sense, it is both within their power and, if you will, their privilege to return a wrong verdict.""
Of this, Callinan J said:
""96  This is to recognise the reality that a jury room might not be a place of undeviating intellectual and logical rigour.  It is not to say that a jury should not perform their sworn duty to determine a case before them according to the evidence. 
...""
His Honour went on to say:
""101  The appellant was entitled to a trial at which directions according to law were given.  It is contrary to human experience that in situations in which a choice of decisions may be made, what is chosen will be unaffected by the variety of the choices offered, particularly when, as here, a particular choice was not the only or inevitable choice.
102  I would agree with the statement that was made by Pincus JA in R v Donald [[1997] QCA 454] in these terms:
'Circumstances can well be imagined in which failure to direct the jury of the possibility of a verdict of guilty of a lesser offence than that of which an offender has been convicted may cause injustice.  That will surely be so, in general, if the lesser verdict is open on the evidence and has been raised as a possibility by the defence ...'.""
Thus, three members of the Court allowed for a certain amount of loose thinking in the jury's reasoning process.  Two members of the Court stood firmly on the assumption that juries comply rigorously with directions and steadfastly discharge their duties. 
Stevens v The Queen [2005] HCA 65; 227 CLR 319
84This was another case that concerned the Queensland Code.  The short facts were that the victim was shot in the head.  The only other person present at the time of the shooting was Stevens.  At trial Stevens gave an account of events preceding the shooting.  His account was that he and the victim were business colleagues and friends who had arranged to meet for a discussion of their business arrangements, which were in a state of flux.  When Stevens arrived for the meeting he found the victim holding a rifle that was pointed upwards.  Stevens stepped forward to grab the gun, which discharged, killing the victim.  Stevens was charged with murder.  
85Although asked to do so by counsel who appeared for Stevens at trial, the trial judge refused to leave to the jury the question of accident (for which express provision is made by statute).  Instead, he directed the jury that intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm was an essential element of the offence of murder.  If one or other of those intentions was not proven, the necessary consequence was acquittal.  Manslaughter was not contended for either by the Crown or by the defence.  
86Nor was it argued in the High Court that manslaughter ought to have been left.  The issue was the adequacy of the directions with respect to the nature of the factual issues in dispute.  
87Notwithstanding that, McHugh J considered that manslaughter ought to have been left (at [30]).  At [29] he said:
""A jury is entitled to refuse to accept the cases of the parties and 'work out for themselves a view of the case which did not exactly represent what either party said'.""
88In support of this proposition he referred to Williams v Smith [1960] HCA 22; 103 CLR 539 at 545.  Williams v Smith was a civil case, tried before a jury, involving a claim for damages for personal injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident.  There was conflicting evidence about the circumstances of the accident from the plaintiff and the defendant.  The jury found in favour of the plaintiff motor cycle rider, but the Full Court of the Supreme Court of NSW set aside their verdict, finding that, on the plaintiff's own evidence, contributory negligence was established (in the days when contributory negligence was a complete defence).  The High Court reversed that decision, saying:
""It was indeed a case in which the very divergent views of the parties might be compared by the jury and they might work out for themselves a view of the case which did not exactly represent what either party said.  That is a possibility in such cases as this which every court of appeal must contemplate, and although there is no reason to suppose that is what they did in this case, it should not be excluded from the general view of the court.""
89Of significance, Williams v Smith was a case in which two competing, and divergent, accounts had been given.  It was in that context that the Court said that the jury could, in effect, work out that the truth lay somewhere between the two versions.  Moreover, while the Court accepted that a jury could develop its own hypothesis, there is nothing in the judgment that suggests that a judge should invite the jury to do so.
90Two other members of the Court in Stevens, Kirby J and Callinan J, joined McHugh J in allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, but on the ground that the sought direction concerning accident should have been given.  Kirby J expressly rejected the proposition that manslaughter ought to have been left, saying:
""87  ... To introduce that consideration as a possibility would have involved pure speculation applied to [the evidence of an expert witness].  There was no other evidentiary basis upon which manslaughter arose for judicial directions.
88  ... Although the agreement of the parties cannot control the judicial duty to instruct the jury on applicable principles of law, the trial judge did not err in failing to direct the jury in the present trial on manslaughter.""
Callinan J (at [61]) agreed that the case did not call for a direction on manslaughter.
91Gleeson CJ and Heydon J dissented in the result.  Their joint judgment is important for a passage to which we will return, but which may conveniently be extracted at this point:
""5  Both the prosecution and the defence conducted the trial on the basis that either it was a case of murder or the appellant must be acquitted.  Manslaughter was not left to the jury.  Neither side wanted that, and it has not been argued that manslaughter should have been left.  No doubt it is possible to surmise that something might have occurred between the two men that was different from what the prosecution alleged, and different from what the appellant said.  What that could have been, however, is entirely a matter of speculation.  The jury were not invited, by either counsel, or by the trial judge, to engage in such speculation.  They were instructed that, unless they accepted the prosecution case, as summarised above, they must acquit the appellant."" (italics added)
Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1
92In Gillard, in a trial in the Supreme Court of South Australia, it was the prosecution who sought to have manslaughter left to the jury.  The defence successfully resisted the prosecution's application, and the trial judge declined to leave manslaughter; that ruling was upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court of South Australia: R v Gillard and Preston (No 3) [2000] SASC 454; 78 SASR 279.  In the High Court, the Crown conceded that manslaughter ought to have been left.  The High Court unanimously accepted that that concession was correctly made.  It is apparent from the judgments that the category of manslaughter that the Court had in mind was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act: see [15], [16] (the extract from Markby v The Queen [1978] HCA 29; 140 CLR 108 at 112-113), [18] (the quote from R v Collie [1991] SASC 2996; (1992) 56 SASR 302), [25], [125].  The discussion in that case, however, as in Gilbert, focused on the principles relevant to joint criminal enterprises resulting in death.  It throws little if any light on the issues that arise in the present case.  Although considerable attention was paid to explaining the reasons that the Crown concession was correct, the real issue in the appeal was, again as in Gilbert, whether, notwithstanding the error, the proviso ought to be applied on the basis that conviction of murder was inevitable.  All members of the Court agreed that it ought not, and ordered a new trial. 
93None of the above cases factually bears any resemblance to the present case.  The Court was referred to no case remotely like the present.  For a practical application of the Pemble doctrine, reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223; 217 A Crim R 201.
94Carney and Cambey was a case that may fairly be said to have taken the Pemble/Kanaan principles to their outer limits.  The Crown case was that Carney and Cambey, with two other men (one of whom was tried separately) drove to the home of the victim for the purpose of obtaining cannabis, either on credit or as a result of a threat of violence.  They assaulted the victim by hitting him around the head with a 30 cm metal bar and kicked and stomped on him.  He died of head injuries, the result of a skull fracture.  The evidence showed at least four separate blows to the head with the metal bar.  The case was put to the jury on the basis that Carney and Cambey each inflicted injuries, or, alternatively, aided or abetted others to do so.
95Neither Carney nor Cambey gave evidence in the trial.  The defence made on their behalf was to put the Crown to proof, by suggesting that neither was present in the victim's home when the injuries were inflicted.  A specific concession was made on behalf of Cambey that whoever inflicted the blows intended at least to cause grievous bodily harm.  
96In these circumstances, not surprisingly, the jury were not directed of an alternative verdict of manslaughter; no suggestion was made to the judge that such a direction should be given.
97Notwithstanding that, on appeal, it was contended, and accepted, that such a direction ought to have been given.  The Court noted the test in Pemble and Kanaan - whether a verdict of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act was ""open on the evidence"", or was ""viable"".
98The Court accepted arguments that Carney and/or Cambey may have used the metal bar ""only intending to render the deceased unconscious or otherwise to incapacitate him"", providing the basis for ""a reasonable possibility that there was no intention to cause him really serious harm"".  It was put, and accepted, that there was a reasonable possibility on the medical evidence consistent with Carney and/or Cambey striking the victim once, intending to render him unconsciousness or otherwise to incapacitate him, and then having to strike him again with greater levels of force because the initial blows were ineffective.
99Reliance upon this decision in the present case is misplaced.  Certainly, it is a precedent likely to encourage appeal grounds of the kind now under consideration.  However, there is no new statement of principle in the judgment; the statements of the applicable law are orthodox and uncontroversial.  While some may consider the application of the principles to be surprising, even questionable, the judgment is of no precedent value. 

Application of relevant principles to the present case
100Kanaan Proposition 4(c) is to the effect that it would be wrong for this Court to take the view that, because the jury accepted that the Crown had proved all of the elements necessary to establish murder, an alternative verdict of manslaughter was necessarily excluded.  The basis for this proposition lies in Gilbert and Gillard.
101It is not uncommon in trials of criminal offences for alternatives to be identified in descending order of seriousness.  Once a jury has found one of the alternatives established, it does not proceed further down the list.  Kanaan Proposition 4(c) appears to create an exception to that practice, in the case of murder trials.  As a matter of logic, that can only emerge from reliance on the potential of a jury to take a sympathetic, or merciful - but not intellectually rigorous - view of the evidence.  As a matter of logic, if a jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of murder, there remains no room for a verdict of involuntary manslaughter.  That is in accordance with s 18 of the Crimes Act.  
102Underlying Kanaan Proposition 4(c) is an assumption that, provided with alternatives, the jury may draw inferences, available on the evidence, more favourable to the accused person.  We accept that that is the approach presently mandated.  However, it remains subject to the existence of an evidentiary foundation for the inferences.  
103The key to the determination of this ground of appeal lies in the examination of what must be established in order to prove the appellant guilty of either of the categories of manslaughter.  That examination has to take place in the context of the evidence.  What is somewhat unusual is that, as Tegan's body has not been found, no cause of death can be determined.  Whether the ground succeeds depends upon what inferences were (or would have been) properly available to the jury, on the evidence in the trial.  
104The circumstance that no cause of death can be determined concludes the issue of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.  Guilt of this offence depends upon the absence of intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm.  As we have acknowledged above, the same evidence may be capable to giving rise to inferences that justify, or call for, a finding of murder, or that justify, or call for, a finding of manslaughter.  As pointed out above, for a verdict of guilty of that category of manslaughter, it is necessary that the act causing death be identified with precision, in order that it can properly be characterised as both unlawful (a breach of the criminal law), and dangerous.  What, it may be asked, is the criminal act that caused the death?  How can it be said that it was dangerous in the sense that a reasonable person in the position of the appellant, performing that act, would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an appreciable risk of serious injury?  The evidence was not such as to permit or justify the inferences necessary to found a conviction of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.  It was therefore not an error not to leave that verdict to the jury.  
105The same reasoning applies to manslaughter by criminal negligence.  In order to establish guilt of that category of manslaughter, it is necessary that the Crown prove an act or omission in breach of the appellant's undoubted duty of care to Tegan, the causal connection between that act or omission and the death, and, importantly, that the breach of duty was so grave as to merit criminal punishment.  Guilt of this offence also depends upon the absence of intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm.
106To come to a conclusion that the appellant was guilty of either category of manslaughter, in the absence of evidence as to the nature of the act or omission causing death, would be to engage in pure speculation.  To leave either category of manslaughter to the jury would be to invite the jury to engage in pure speculation.  It will be recalled that, in Stevens, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J (while in dissent in the result) dismissed the possibility of inviting surmise or speculation, as did Kirby J.
107The majority judgments in Gilbert are instructive in that they recognise that juries may not always apply intellectual rigour to the reasoning process.  They do not, however, authorise an approach to jury directions that involves an invitation to speculation or conjecture.  It remains the case that there must be an evidentiary foundation for a finding of guilty of either category of manslaughter.
108This was a case in which the jury had a particularly difficult task.  They were faced with a young woman, of prior good character, accused of murdering her two day old baby.  No body had been found, and therefore no cause of death could be established.  Every element of the offence had to be proved by the Crown by inference.  It may reasonably be asked, and the question has to be confronted, why it is permissible for the jury to draw the inference that, by some means that cannot be specified, the appellant murdered the child, but that it would not have been permissible for the jury to find that she killed the child, but in a manner that amounted to manslaughter rather than murder.
109The answer to that question lies in the distinction, which is a very real one, between inference and speculation.  In Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness; James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262, Spigelman CJ considered this very question.  He acknowledged that it is often difficult to distinguish between permissible inference and conjecture.  Quoting from Jones v Great Western Railway Co (1930) 144 LT 194, his Honour adopted a definition of inference as ""a deduction from the evidence"" which, if reasonable, may have the validity of legal proof.
110He referred also to Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 152, quoting as follows: 
""Inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or speculation.  There can be no inference unless there are objective facts from which to infer the other facts which it is sought to establish.  In some cases the other facts can be inferred with as much practical certainty as if they had been actually observed.  In other cases the inference does not go beyond reasonable probability.  But if there are no positive proved facts from which the inference can be made, the method of inference fails and what is left is mere speculation or conjecture.""
Spigelman CJ stated the test as:
""... whether, on the basis of the primary facts, it is reasonable to draw the inference.""
To similar effect were observations of Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ in Barca v The Queen [1975] HCA 42; 133 CLR 82 at 104-105.
111The critical issue in this case is the inferences available to be drawn concerning the appellant's state of mind.  As we have mentioned, it may be taken that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Tegan was dead, and that her death had been caused by an act or omission of the appellant.  Those conclusions are not in issue for the purpose of this ground.  The circumstance that would distinguish the appellant's guilt of murder from guilt of manslaughter by criminal negligence is her state of mind.  There was before the jury a great deal of evidence that the appellant was determined not to accept responsibility for the care of a child.  True it is, competing arguments could be, and were, advanced in relation to the inferences to be drawn from the manner in which she had (lawfully) previously disposed of children, and the manner in which she subsequently disposed (again lawfully) of another.  The jury were also entitled to take into account evidence of the accounts she gave concerning her disposal of Tegan to, as she asserted, the child's natural father.  The jury were entitled to accept the Crown contention that these were lies evidencing consciousness of guilt.  These alone were sufficient to provide the evidentiary foundation for an inference that, in causing the death of the child, she acted with the intention of killing.  They provide no factual foundation for an inference that the manner in which she killed Tegan was a breach of duty of the requisite gravity.  There was no other evidentiary foundation for such a conclusion.  It was therefore not an error not to leave that possible verdict to the jury.
112Accordingly, we reject this ground of appeal.
Ground 2: alleged miscarriage of justice due to conduct of the Crown by failing to have the jury consider manslaughter as an alternative verdict and due to the content of the Crown's address
113The first aspect of this ground must be dismissed for the same reasons as given with respect to the first ground of appeal since the obligation of the trial judge to leave manslaughter to the jury is greater than the obligation of the prosecutor to address on it in circumstances where the accused does not contend that it is available.
114The second aspect of this ground arises from the Crown's closing address to the jury.  The appellant challenges the following aspects of the address: the expression of personal opinion by the prosecutor; the prosecutor insinuating in his address that the appellant was a person of bad character in that she would mistreat or malign innocent people; and his posing of ten questions in the Crown's closing address, which the appellant contended had the effect of reversing the onus of proof.
115In support of her contention that the prosecutor had impermissibly expressed a personal opinion, the appellant instanced the Crown saying, ""Come on"" when the prosecutor was addressing the significance of the appellant's having filled in a Medicare form that registered Tegan as her child:
""What's the significance of the Medicare membership form?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if the accused was intending to hand over baby Tegan to anyone - Andrew Norris/Morris - anybody at all, why on earth would she fill out a Medicare membership form to place Tegan's membership on her own membership?  The filling out of the Medicare membership form shows that the accused never intended handing Tegan over to anyone.  It's inconsistent with her giving the baby to anybody.  She filled out the form because the hospital were urging her to do so, you might think. 
What does she say in her ERISP interviews about why she filled out the Medicare membership form?  What she said to the police in her first ERISP interview at question 72, you might like to make a note of that so you can read it yourselves, question 72 in the first ERISP interview, she told police that she filled it in in case Tegan was in her care in the future.  Come on."" [Emphasis added]
116As Heydon J said in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at 600, legitimate comments, including disparaging ones, concerning the evidence or lack of it can appropriately be made in final address.  In our view, the duties of a prosecutor are not inconsistent with the use of rhetoric.  In a circumstantial case where the Crown must exclude all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence, a prosecutor may, in the course of final address, be obliged in the course of forceful presentation of the Crown case to disparage versions given by the accused on the grounds that they do not fit with the surrounding facts and circumstances or are, for other reasons, not to be accepted.  Less formal language, including vernacular phrases, may appropriately be used to persuade the jury to exclude those hypotheses consistent with innocence. The responsibilities of the prosecutor do not preclude resort to colourful language as a tool of persuasion.
117We do not consider the prosecutor to have overstepped the bounds of his role when he used the phrase, ""Come on"", to persuade the jury that the appellant's explanation was manifestly implausible.
118The appellant further contended that the prosecutor had insinuated in his address that the appellant was a person of bad character in that she would mistreat or malign innocent people.  She instanced the following two passages in the Crown closing address:
""So, ladies and gentlemen, having lied about Duncan Gillies, having had the lies exposed, having waited 35 days to make up another story, she then tells the most abject lies again to this supportive, gentle, caring adoption worker [Virginia Fung].
...
So here is the accused allowing completely fictitious information about a fictitious person [AJ's birth father and siblings] being provided in a document [prepared by Virginia Fung on the basis of what the appellant told her for eventual access of AJ] that would at some stage potentially be made available to AJ when he reached a suitable age."" 
119The Crown case was that the appellant's conduct followed a pattern of keeping secret her several pregnancies and finding permanent solutions for the children she had borne such that she would not have to care for them for any time after her discharge from hospital following their respective births.  That part of the prosecutor's address that included these passages was directed to highlighting the extent to which the appellant kept the truth of AJ's birth secret.  This was, in turn, relevant to her conduct and motive surrounding Tegan's birth.  The description of Ms Fung as ""gentle"" and ""caring"" advanced the Crown case that the appellant was not to be believed since she fabricated falsehoods even to a person who was not only sympathetic but also, inferentially, non-judgmental.  That the appellant would tell lies which she knew would be likely eventually to be communicated to one of her children, AJ, also supported the Crown case that she was lacking in credit and, most importantly, that her version that she gave Tegan to her natural father could be excluded beyond reasonable doubt.
120In this forensic context, the passages relied upon were neither gratuitous, nor inappropriate.  This may explain why defence counsel at trial did not object to them.
121The appellant separately challenged the final portion of the Crown's address in the following terms:
""I have said to you that I don't know exactly what my friend is going to say in his address, but what I would ask you to do is to bear in mind certain questions whilst you are listening to Mr Chapple's address and to see what he says about these particular issues which we would submit to you are particularly pertinent issues to the resolution of this case.
Firstly, why did the accused give eight different versions of what happened to Tegan?
Secondly, why did the accused add Tegan to her Medicare membership at the Auburn Hospital if she was about to hand over Tegan to anyone else?
Thirdly, why did it take the accused four hours to get home from the Auburn Hospital to Fairlight, either directly or via Venus Street?
Fourthly, why did the accused tell Detective Kehoe and initially Detective Gaut that she would not be able to find Andrew Norris/Morris's unit in Balmain when she so easily found it in May 2003?
Fifthly, why did the accused wait until May 2003 to look for Andrew Norris/Morris's unit in Balmain?
Sixthly, why did Keli Lane lie to Detective Gaut about Lisa Andreatta of Brisbane knowing Andrew Morris and about the Tegan birth?
Seventhly, why did the accused lie to Detective Gaut about looking for Andrew Norris/Morris's mobile phone number of Venus Street?
Eight, why did the accused lie to Detective Gaut that her circle of friends had changed since the time that she had known Andrew Norris/Morris?
Number nine is, is it just a coincidence that there are so many similarities between Andrew Norris/Morris and [AW]?
Finally, tenthly, why would a natural father of a child not lodge the child's birth registration forms?"" 
122The appellant submitted that the effect of the Crown posing questions in such a form was to reverse the onus of proof.  She relied on Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 (Wood) at [604]-[605] per McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Latham and Rothman JJ agreed and also referred to R v Rugari [2001] NSWCCA 64; 122 A Crim R 1 (Rugari) at [57].  She submitted that she had not had a fair trial according to law and that the conviction ought be quashed.
123It is inappropriate and unsatisfactory for a prosecutor to ask questions of a jury in the course of closing address which are designed to undermine or disparage the defence case because of the risk that it will give the jury the impression that the accused, contrary to the fundamental principle that the accused is presumed to be innocent, bears an onus of answering such questions.  In Wood, this Court held that the course taken by the prosecutor had the effect for which the appellant contended in this appeal: it reversed the onus of proof.  This Court said in Wood at [605]:
""Asking questions, even in a rhetorical manner, and inviting the jury when considering its verdict to consider whether the applicant had provided satisfactory answers to the questions was an impermissible course for the prosecutor to follow.""
124It does not, however, follow from the general undesirability of a prosecutor posing questions in that way that in every case where such questions are asked, the verdict must be quashed because of a miscarriage of justice.  The question is whether the departure from the standards expected of a prosecutor has affected the accused's fundamental right to a fair trial. If it has, then this Court must intervene.  If it has not then, while such a departure is always regrettable, a departure that is inconsequential in the context of the whole trial, including the summing up, will not require the conviction to be quashed: see Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 at 663-664 per Deane J.
125In Wood, there were significant extra factors which led to the quashing of the conviction, not the least of which were the content and number of the questions, of which there were fifty, and the conduct of the prosecutor throughout the trial.  In Rugari, it was not merely the asking of questions, but also the belittling of the appellant's counsel's cross-examination of Crown witnesses and a misstatement of the effect of there not being cross-examination on particular matters.
126What consequences flow from questions being asked substantially depends on the content of the questions, whether any objection was made at trial by counsel for the accused and whether the trial judge sought to correct any misapprehension that the posing of questions may have created by directing the jury as to the onus of proof.
127In the instant case, although it was undesirable that the matters put to the jury at the conclusion of final address were put in the form of questions, each concerned an issue which was relevant to the jury's consideration whether the Crown had excluded the hypothesis that the appellant had given Tegan to her natural father, Andrew Norris, at or near Auburn Hospital before she went to Fairlight to meet Duncan Gillies at 3pm and change her clothes for the wedding.  Had these matters been identified as relevant issues rather than questions, no exception could reasonably have been taken to any of them. 
128Four of the questions posed, the first, sixth, seventh and eighth, concerned the appellant's credibility directly which was, itself, a relevant issue which would assist the jury to determine whether the hypothesis consistent with innocence for which the appellant contended had been excluded by the Crown.  The second question was relevant in that it served to highlight a potential inconsistency between the appellant's version and her conduct.  The third question highlighted the period of time which, on the Crown case, gave the appellant the opportunity to kill Tegan.  The fourth question highlighted an inconsistency between the appellant's conduct and what she said, which served not only to undermine her credibility but also to persuade the jury that Andrew Norris was a fictitious person, whose existence was fabricated by the appellant to avoid responsibility for the murder.  The fifth question was also relevant to the Crown case that Andrew Norris/Morris was a fabrication.  The ninth and tenth questions raise further matters on which the Crown relied to persuade the jury that the appellant had made up Andrew Norris/Morris. 
129It can be inferred, in the absence of any suggestion of incompetence, that defence counsel at trial considered that no such direction was required, or that the direction given by the trial judge was ample to counter any prejudice that might flow from the prosecutor's questions in final address. The appellant is, in these circumstances, bound by the conduct of her counsel at trial and there is no basis for this Court's intervention unless we consider there to have been a miscarriage of justice: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 (Birks), at 684-685 per Gleeson CJ, McInerney J agreeing; see also TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [8] per Gleeson CJ (TKWJ), which in this context means that the appellant must show that she lost a real chance of acquittal.
130In his summing up, at [333]-[334] the trial judge gave the following direction:
""The Crown then concluded its submissions by asking you to bear in mind a number of questions when you were considering the defence arguments.  I will not go through them all, but quickly, they were to this effect: Why did the accused give eight versions?  Why add Tegan's name to the Medicare card?  Why take a number of hours to get home?  Why tell Kehoe that she could not locate the unit when later it was found relatively easily?  Why were lies told about Lisa Andreatta, the search for Andrew's mobile, the circle of friends changing.
I will not go through them all but, as I say, in a sense, those questions do touch upon the central issues I have identified for you.  They, of course, are not the central issues, but in turn they may be matters that you are perfectly entitled to consider.  I think you should be careful to remember that they do not impose some type of onus on the defence to answer them all.  The defence does not have an onus of proof.  They are more matters for your consideration in the light of all the evidence.  Of course, as I will point out to you when we come to the defence submissions, a number of them were the subject of answer or response or submission, and it will be a matter for you what you make of them.  The point I am making is that the Crown does not, by asking the question, alter or change the onus of proof which remains always on the Crown."" (italics added)
131We are bound to accept, there being no contrary indication, that the jury applied the directions of the trial judge: Demirok v The Queen [1977] HCA 21; 137 CLR 20 at 22 per Barwick CJ.  We do not consider that, once directed by the trial judge in the terms set out above, there was any reasonable possibility that the jury would have been acting under a misapprehension as to the onus of proof or that it was for the appellant to provide an answer to the questions posed by the prosecutor, even if the posing of such questions had had such an effect in the first place. 
132We consider it to be appropriate to grant leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules because of the importance of the onus of proof and the jeopardy to it that the posing of questions by prosecutors poses.  However, for the reasons given we do not consider that any deleterious effect of the questions was more than transitory.  Accordingly this ground fails.
Ground 3: a separate trial application should have been made by trial counsel in respect of the perjury/false swearing charges
133The appellant submitted that the nature of the perjury charges was highly prejudicial to her at trial and made the Crown case in respect of the murder charge ""immeasurably stronger"".  The appellant also relied on the directed verdicts of acquittal in respect of the perjury charges in support of her contention that a separate trial application ought to have been made.
134No allegation is made that the trial judge failed in any way to direct the jury appropriately as to how it might use evidence in respect of each count or the need to consider each count separately.
135In order to determine this ground it is not necessary for this Court to consider the hypothetical prospects of success of an application for a separate trial, had one been made. The appellant's trial counsel expressly confirmed, at a pre-trial hearing on 6 August 2010, that he was instructed not to make such an application. It can be assumed that those instructions were given on advice. No allegation was made that trial counsel was incompetent. For the same reasons as we have earlier given with respect to the second ground, the appellant is, in these circumstances, bound by the conduct of her counsel at trial: Birks at 684-685 per Gleeson CJ, McInerney J agreeing. No basis for this Court's intervention has been established.
136Accordingly, this ground fails.


Ground 5: the trial miscarried by the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury after the prosecutor made prejudicial remarks in his opening address
137This ground is based on the following passage from the Crown's opening on 10 August 2010, the second day of trial:
""We don't know how or where the accused killed Tegan, or how she disposed of the body.  However, the Auburn Hospital was just a couple of kilometres away from the Australian College of Physical Education at what was then the Homebush Olympics site which at that time in 1996 was surrounded by vast swathes of vacant land, a few building sites and deserted roads, particularly at the weekend.  So there was an opportunity nearby for the accused to find somewhere that was entirely private, which would have given her an opportunity to kill Tegan and dispose of the body."" 
138On the following day, 11 August 2010, defence counsel submitted that, in the absence of any evidence having been served of any search for Tegan's body having been undertaken at the Olympic site, the matter ought not to have been raised in opening.  In the absence of the jury, the prosecutor confirmed that there was no evidence either of the method of killing or the disposal of the body or any search of the Olympic site having been undertaken.  The trial judge invited the Crown to correct his opening, which he did as soon as the jury returned, in the following terms:
""Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to begin by just referring to several of the things that I said yesterday.  The first thing I would like to do is I suppose by way of a type of correction.  Yesterday I said to you that we don't know how or where the accused killed Tegan, or how she disposed of the body.  There is no evidence at all as to what happened to Tegan or the accused, for that matter, during those three hours plus between when she left the hospital before midday, to use your own words, and when she arrived at her parents' house at Fairlight at 3pm.
I think it is fair to say, ladies and gentlemen, that it would not be appropriate for you to speculate about what might have happened during that time.  I ought not to have speculated about the Olympic site because there is no evidence of the Olympic site having been searched.  I would like to correct what I said yesterday in that regard."" 
139Later that day, in the course of opening the case for the defence, trial counsel reminded the jury of the ""error"":
""And she didn't scuttle out of the place.  She didn't dodge out of the fire escape.  These are suggestions made to you, theories, speculation, we would say to you, and you have seen how dangerous speculation is in this case, theorising, not looking at the evidence.  My learned friend made that error yesterday in relation to the Olympic site.  If you've killed a baby, you've got to get rid of the body you might feel.  You can't take it to a wedding.
For some reason it's suggested because there's a big site where the Olympics are going to take place, that in broad daylight somebody would go and do that anyway, you might have thought as you heard that.  But a theory.  No evidence that the police went out there and whatever.  None.  Do not even know which way she went.  I don't know if there's any real evidence of how she went from Auburn to Fairlight to the wedding.  So we urge you, members of the jury, [be] careful [of] speculation."" (italics added)
140The appellant submitted that the passage in the Crown opening was highly prejudicial, speculative and deliberate, that it was not cured by the ""correction"" and that it could only be cured by a discharge of the jury.  She submitted accordingly that defence counsel ought to have applied for the jury to be discharged and that such an application would have been granted because the trial was only in its second day.
141The appellant purported to concede that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.  However, in our view, Rule 4 does not, in terms apply to the present ground since Rule 4 is confined to directions, omissions to direct, or decisions as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the trial judge. 
142The fundamental obstacle that faces the appellant in pressing this ground is that her counsel at trial did not apply for a discharge of the jury: Birks.  Rather, it appears that he made a decision to exploit the Crown's error and use it for his client's forensic advantage to warn the jury against speculation and, at least by implication, against placing too much reliance on what the Crown said, as distinct from the evidence.  It is not for this Court to enquire as to the actual reasons for trial counsel preferring this course to an application for discharge.  In our view, trial counsel's decision is rationally capable of explanation on the basis of a perceived forensic advantage: TKWJ at [27] per Gaudron J.  Accordingly we are entitled to conclude that no unfairness attended the process: Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 162 A Crim R 301 at [9]. 
143This is sufficient to dispose of this ground.  It is rejected.
Ground 6: the trial judge erred in granting the prosecutor's application pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act to have Peter Clark cross-examined due to his making an allegedly inconsistent statement
144This ground must be addressed in the context in which the application for leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act was made.
145The Crown case was that neither Andrew Norris nor Morris existed and that the information provided to police by the appellant as to his identity, his residential address (variously Units 10 or 11, 24 Wisbeach Street, Balmain) and the name of his partner, Mel, was false.
146At the relevant time Unit 10 was occupied by Sean Greaves who did not know anyone by the name of Andrew Norris or Morris and had never used that name himself.  He did not recall receiving mail for such a person.  He denied having a woman called Mel stay in his unit, having anyone mind his unit while he was away or knowing the appellant.  The appellant did not suggest that she knew him.  There was accordingly evidence which, if accepted by the jury, could exclude Unit 10 as a location where Andrew Norris/ Morris lived.
147Peter Clark lived with his brother Steven but with no one else in Unit 11 between December 1995 and December 1996.  Having regard to Tegan's birth date, and the estimates that she was about full-term, she must have been conceived in about December 1995. 
148In his first statement to police dated 3 December 2003 Mr Clark said he knew an Andrew Morris who was of Asian appearance but he had not seen him since 1990 and had not been to their unit.  The appellant said that Tegan's father was not Asian.
149When Mr Clark gave evidence on 23 June 2005 at the inquest into Tegan's death he did not give evidence of seeing any mail addressed to Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris.
150On 13 August 2008 Mr Clark provided the police with a second statement in which he said that some time after his first statement he recalled having seen the name Andrew Morris on an envelope in the letter box for Unit 10 in about 1995 or 1996, which he remembered because he knew a man by the name of Andrew Morris.  He said that he was 90 per cent sure that the letter was typed.  He explained that he had not mentioned it at the inquest because he thought he might have been mistaken once he heard the real estate agent give evidence that there was no one by that name living in the block and that he wished neither to place undue pressure on the Lane family or deceive the coroner.
151On 6 April 2010 Mr Clark provided a third statement to police in which he said he had seen mail addressed to both Andrew Morris and Andrew Norris at different times.
152On the voir dire on 22 September 2010 Mr Clark's evidence was:
""Q. Whereabouts did you see it? A. I believe it to be number 10. 
Q. Do you know who was the occupant of number 10? A. Only by sight. I later found out it was Sean Greaves. 
Q. Whereabouts was the mail when you saw it? A. In number 10. I'm not exactly sure. It could have even been outside the main blocks. As you may understand, often mail is left out. 
Q. Do you recall how often you saw this? A. I saw some mail for Andrew Morris I'd say on more than one occasion. Andrew Norris was just the once. I think for one of those occasions for Andrew Morris, it may even have been in the foyer of the building, but I'd be prepared to say that Andrew Norris once, Andrew Morris more than once."" 
153The Crown sought leave to cross-examine Mr Clark pursuant to s 38(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) on two bases: first, that he was an unfavourable witness; and secondly, that he had made a prior inconsistent statement.
154The appellant's trial counsel objected to the grant of leave on the basis that there was no inconsistency.  The trial judge, who was satisfied that there was an inconsistency, and that s 192 of the Evidence Act did not preclude the grant of leave, permitted the Crown to cross-examine Mr Clark on condition that the cross-examination was confined to the issue of the mail. 
155The appellant submitted, in support of this ground, that the reasons did not disclose a clear inconsistency within the meaning of s 38 of the Evidence Act and, further, that the trial judge ought to have exercised his discretion under s 192 of the Evidence Act to refuse the grant of leave.
156Section 38(1) of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:
""A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: (a)  evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or... (c)  whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.""
157Section 192 of the Evidence Act provides:
""Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms(1)  If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.(2)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: (a)  the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and(b)  the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and(c)  the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and(d)  the nature of the proceeding, and(e)  the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.""
158The reasons for the grant of leave appear sufficiently from the transcript of argument.  First, the trial judge was satisfied Mr Clark had made a prior inconsistent statement.  His Honour put to the appellant's trial counsel in the course of argument that in his first statement Mr Clark was effectively saying:
""'there's only one person I've known and he never lived there' and, by inference, 'I don't know any other Andrew Morris and no other Andrew Morris lived at our block of units'."" 
159His Honour then put to the appellant's trial counsel that this was inconsistent with what the witness said in his later statements: namely that he had seen mail addressed to Andrew Norris/Morris.  We respectfully agree with the conclusion of the trial judge that the condition for the grant of leave under s 38(1)(c) had been fulfilled because Mr Clark had given the following three inconsistent versions:
(1)no mention of mail (first statement: 3 December 2003 and inquest: 23 June 2005);
(2)saw an envelope addressed to Andrew Morris (second statement: 13 August 2008);
(3)saw mail addressed to both Andrew Morris and Andrew Norris at different times (third statement: 6 April 2010); and saw mail addressed to Andrew Morris more than once and to Andrew Norris once (voir dire: 22 September 2010).
160Further, the trial judge accepted that Mr Clark's evidence was unfavourable to the Crown since its case was that the Andrew Morris/Norris described to the police in the interview as living in one of those units was a fictitious person and the delivery of mail to such a person tended to establish the contrary.  Accordingly, there was a separate basis, s 38(1)(a) on which to support a grant of leave.
161The appellant's trial counsel accepted that Mr Clark's evidence was unfavourable.  However, he submitted that the application ought be refused under s 192 of the Evidence Act because to grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Mr Clark would be unfair to the appellant (s 192(2)(b)) in that it would undermine the general principle that the Crown is obliged to call all relevant witnesses in this case unless the prosecutor concludes that the witness is not credible or truthful.
162The trial judge considered that the imposition of conditions on the grant of leave that the cross-examination be limited to the issue of the mail, that it not extend to matters solely relevant to Mr Clark's credibility and that it take place before defence counsel was required to cross-examine Mr Clark would be sufficient to avoid unfairness. 
163The appellant submitted in this Court that the trial judge inappropriately permitted cross-examination that impugned the credibility of Mr Clark and that this course was inconsistent with the Crown's duty of fairness to her.  The appellant appeared also to rely on the argument put by defence counsel at trial that a grant of leave to permit a prosecutor to cross-examine a Crown witness was inconsistent with the requirement of prosecutorial fairness and that the leave ought to have been refused by reason of s 192(2)(b).
164As a matter of general principle it is for the prosecutor alone to decide what witnesses will be called for the prosecution.  However, it is appropriate that the prosecutor exercise that discretion so as to call all relevant witnesses, unless the prosecutor concludes that such witnesses are not credible or truthful, so that the defence counsel has the opportunity to cross-examine them: Richardson v The Queen [1974] HCA 19; 131 CLR 116 at 120-121. 
165In our view, s 38 does not create an inconsistency with the general principle referred to above or in any way interfere with the duties of prosecutors.  It provides a mechanism whereby the party calling a witness is, with leave, permitted to cross-examine its own witness, in circumstances that include where the witness is unfavourable or has made a prior inconsistent statement.  A grant of leave does not remove the right of the other party, in this case the appellant, to cross-examine the witness.
166Section 192 provides added protection to the opposing party in that, by s 192(2), it obliges the trial judge to take certain matters into account in deciding whether leave ought be granted.  Such matters include the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness: s 192(2)(b).
167The effect of the prosecutor's decision to call Mr Clark in the Crown case was to provide an opportunity for the defence to cross-examine him.  Had the discretion been exercised not to call Mr Clark, the appellant would have had no choice but to call Mr Clark if she wished to have the benefit of his evidence.  The prosecutor sought leave under s 38 to cross-examine Mr Clark.  For the reasons given, the conditions for a grant of leave were met in two respects: his evidence was unfavourable and he had made at least one if not two prior inconsistent statements.
168The conditions on the grant of leave confined the Crown's cross-examination to the issue of mail, which was the issue in respect of which Mr Clark's evidence was unfavourable and in respect of which he had made prior inconsistent statements.  It was inevitable that questions concerning his prior inconsistent statements about the mail would be relevant not only to the issue - whether the Andrew Norris/Morris to whom the appellant referred was a real person - but also to his credibility, in the sense of the reliability of his recollection: see Onassis and Calogeropoulos v Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyd's Rep 403 at 431 per Lord Pearce.  We cannot discern any unfairness in the grant of leave having regard to the conditions imposed.  The appellant's concession that leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required amounts to a concession that defence counsel at trial did not object to the conditions of the grant of leave that were proposed by the trial judge. 
169As we are unable to discern any merit in this ground we are not disposed to grant leave.
Ground 8: failure of the trial counsel to ask for a direction that the appellant had suffered prejudice as a result of the delay in prosecution
170The appellant submitted that she had suffered a forensic disadvantage by reason of the passage of time between the commission of the offence and the trial which was exacerbated by what she termed a substandard police investigation.  She contended that a Longman direction was required as to the effect of the delay on her ability to test the Crown case and that the failure of her trial counsel to seek it had caused her prejudice.  The appellant did not identify any particular inquiry said to have been foreclosed to her because of the delay or what the results of any such inquiry could or might have been.
171This ground falls into the same category as several that have already been considered.  The appellant is bound by her counsel's conduct in not seeking a Longman direction as long as no unfairness attended the process.  Where the omission to seek such a direction was an objectively rational, tactical decision, we are entitled to conclude that no unfairness attended the process: Nudd at [9].  Furthermore as Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies, leave is required to argue this ground.
172In Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79 (Longman), a conviction for indecent assault was quashed and a new trial ordered because a warning had not been given to the jury to the effect that it is unsafe to convict an accused on the uncorroborated evidence of the victim after a long delay.  In Longman, the alleged offence had occurred decades before a complaint had been made to police and the resultant trial.  The relevant factor that was held to require a warning in Longman was that the delay in the complaint had the result that the applicant lost the means of testing the complainant's allegations since it was no longer possible for him to explore the alleged circumstances surrounding the alleged offences and adduce evidence that either cast doubt on the complainant's version or supported his denial. 
173A significant distinction between Longman and the instant case is that the appellant at trial used the length of the period between the date of the alleged offence and the trial to assert that the police investigation could not establish that Tegan was dead.  The absence of a Longman direction, and presumably one of the reasons it was not sought by defence trial counsel, meant that the trial judge did not need to canvass the reasons for the delay as his Honour would have been obliged, as a matter of fairness, to do had such a direction been given.  Any examination of the reasons for the delay would have highlighted the Crown case on the issue: that the appellant had given a false exculpatory account which had the result of sending the police on a wild goose chase to find a non-existent man.  It was an objectively reasonable decision for defence counsel not to seek a Longman direction on the basis that it was not in the appellant's forensic interests for the jury to be further reminded of that.
174There being an objective tactical reason for defence trial counsel's not seeking a Longman direction we are entitled to conclude that no unfairness attended the process.  The appellant has not raised any argument in support of this ground that would incline us to give leave under Rule 4.  Leave is refused.
Ground 7: unreasonable verdict 
175For the purposes of considering ground 7 it is necessary to expand substantially upon the relatively brief outline of the Crown case that appears at the commencement of these reasons.  It is convenient to approach this task generally chronologically.  It is emphasised that the following account is drawn from evidence given in the Crown case.  It is not intended to represent any findings of disputed fact.
176The appellant was born in March 1975, in Sydney.  During the 1990s she lived with her parents in Fairlight, a suburb of Sydney near Manly.  She was an enthusiastic and ambitious participant in the sport of water polo.  Her ambitions extended to representing Australia in international competition, including the Olympic Games.
177In 1991, at about the age of 16 or 17, the appellant became romantically and sexually involved with a young man to whom we will refer as AT.  Towards the end of 1992 the appellant became pregnant.  She and AT made a joint decision to have the pregnancy terminated and this was done.  Although the appellant was then living with her parents at Fairlight, they were unaware of the pregnancy, as were her friends.  
178In November 1993, while the relationship with AT was continuing, the appellant again became pregnant.  On this occasion, she did not inform AT of her pregnancy, and, again, did not inform her parents or friends.  In March 1994 the pregnancy was terminated.  Sometime in early 1994 the relationship with AT came to an end.
179In about May 1994 the appellant began a relationship with another man to whom we will refer as PR.  The relationship was short lived, about six to eight weeks, but during that time the appellant again became pregnant.  In late April 1994 the appellant began a relationship with Duncan Gillies.  At that time Mr Gillies lived at Harbord or Freshwater.  The appellant did not disclose her pregnancy to Mr Gillies, nor, again, to her parents or friends.  Throughout this pregnancy the appellant maintained her usual and normal social and sporting activities.  At about 10pm on 18 March 1995, after playing a competitive game of water polo, followed by socialising at a Balmain hotel, the appellant travelled alone to Balmain hospital.  She was in labour.  She told staff at Balmain Hospital that she was from Perth, where she had been planning to have the baby, and that she had been in Sydney for three weeks.  She gave the name of a doctor who she said was a Perth obstetrician who had been caring for her.  None of this was true.  
180The appellant was transferred to King George V Hospital where, early the next morning, she gave birth to the daughter, to whom we have referred as TR.  She told staff that she had had antenatal care in Perth, that her parents were in Perth, and that she had no social support in Sydney.  None of this true.  She gave an address at Harbord where she said she had been living.  This was not true: she was living with her parents at Fairlight.
181While an inpatient at King George V Hospital the appellant made inquiries about surrendering TR for adoption.  She was referred to the Centacare Adoption Agency where she saw a social worker, Ms Sheila Townsend.  The appellant again gave a deal of false information, some of it replicating that which she had earlier given to King George V Hospital.  She said that she had moved to Perth at the age of 13; she gave a Perth address at which she said her parents lived, and the names of a school and a university which she said she had attended; she repeated the (false) address at which she said she was living in Sydney, and gave a (false) contact telephone number; she said her parents were aware of her pregnancy and, although disappointed, were supportive of adoption.  She said that the father of the child was Duncan Gillies, who she said was a footballer, and that he had indicated a willingness to sign adoption papers, but that he was currently working in the United Kingdom with plans to return in two weeks.  She gave a (false) address at which she said Duncan Gillies lived, and said that she and he had moved to Sydney from Perth three weeks prior to the birth of the baby, and that Duncan Gillies had visited in hospital, and kissed and hugged the baby.  Except that Duncan Gillies was a footballer, none of this was true.  
182Duncan Gillies was, in fact, not the father of the baby.  He knew nothing of the pregnancy, and had not visited the appellant in hospital and, of course, the couple had not recently moved to Sydney from Perth.
183The appellant was discharged on 23 March.  TR was left in the care of the hospital.  Over the ensuing days, the appellant had regular contact with Ms Townsend, who advised her of the need for Mr Gillies to be involved in the adoption decision.  The appellant resisted this.  She told Ms Townsend that she was under a lot of pressure from Mr Gillies because she had promised not to involve him.  However, she also said that Mr Gillies had agreed to visit the adoption agency.  When she next attended, however, she was alone, and said that Mr Gillies had been sent to Scotland to play rugby.  She signed a general consent for adoption.  On 3 April 1995 she swore an affidavit that again contained a number of false statements: she gave the same (false) address as she had previously given, she said that she had been living in a domestic relationship with Mr Gillies since November 1993, and that TR was a child of that relationship, and that Duncan Gillies had indicated his willingness to sign a consent for adoption, but was out of the country working in the United Kingdom.  The false statements in the affidavit were the foundation for the first charge of perjury on the indictment.
184Ms Townsend attempted to contact the appellant and Mr Gillies by telephone at the number the appellant had given, and by writing to the address she had given.  The appellant informed Ms Townsend that she and Mr Gillies had temporarily separated.  She then attended Centacare, and told Ms Townsend that Mr Gillies was claiming that she had tricked him by telling him that he did not need to be involved.  She said that she was staying with Mr Gillies' mother at an address she gave.  On 29 April she swore a second affidavit giving a different (false) address, stating that she had separated from Mr Gillies who she again identified as the ""birth father"", and said that Mr Gillies had informed her that he did not wish to have any involvement with the child, or in the adoption.  The false statements in this affidavit were the foundation for the second charge of perjury on the indictment.
185In April 1995 the appellant was one of 13 selected to compete in international water polo championships.
186Ms Townsend continued her efforts to locate and speak to Mr Gillies.  She telephoned the number given to her by the appellant, and was told that Mr Gillies did not live at that address, and that the telephone number was not associated with the address that the appellant had given.  The appellant attempted to explain this to Ms Townsend by saying that Mr Gillies was avoiding contact, and having his flatmate lie for him.
187In December 1995, while still in the relationship with Mr Gillies, the appellant again became pregnant.  This was the pregnancy that resulted in the birth of Tegan.  Once again, the appellant did not disclose the pregnancy to Mr Gillies, her parents, or her friends.  
188In December 1995 Mr Gillies purchased a house at 10 Venus Street, Gladesville.  The appellant continued to live with her parents at Fairlight, but spent several nights each week with Mr Gillies at the Venus Street house.  They had regular sexual relations and they continued to socialise together.  The appellant continued to play water polo at an elite level.  
189Four times in September 1996 the appellant attended the Ryde Hospital in relation to the pregnancy.  She told staff at that hospital that she had made arrangements for a home birth with a private midwife, that she lived in Perth and was ""in transit"", that her partner was in the United Kingdom, and she gave 70 Venus Avenue, Gladesville as her temporary address in Sydney.  On the third visit she gave the name of her home birth midwife as Julie Melville for whom she nominated an incorrect contact telephone number.  The appellant named ""Kati Holt"" as a contact person, again giving an incorrect telephone number.
190Julie Melville was Duncan Gillies' mother.  She was a registered nurse.  She was in fact a midwife, although not registered as such.  She was not involved in the appellant's care and did not know that the appellant was pregnant.  She did not know that the appellant had given birth.  
191At about 4pm on 11 September 1996 the appellant attended Auburn Hospital where she gave similar information to that she had given to the Ryde Hospital.  She gave the name of Duncan Gillies as a contact person.  She said that she had been referred by her ""home birth midwife"", who she again named as Julie Melville.  
192The appellant was admitted to the Auburn Hospital the following day, 12 September, and gave birth to Tegan on that day.  On the following day, 13 September, nursing staff referred the appellant to a trainee social worker, Alicia Baltra-Vasquez.  Ms Baltra-Vasquez took detailed notes of her consultations with the appellant.  The appellant was referred to Ms Baltra-Vasquez because she was unaccompanied at the hospital, and had no apparent support.  The appellant told her that she had planned to have the baby at home with the help of an independent midwife.  She again said that she had been born in Perth, where her parents still lived.  She said that the pregnancy was planned, and that she and her boyfriend had moved to Sydney a few months previously and had no family or close friends in this city.  She said that it was intended that the boyfriend would be present at the birth, which was due on 30 August, but that, as the baby was late, her boyfriend was overseas playing football and was not able to be present.  She told Ms Baltra-Vasquez that she planned to be discharged the following day, 14 September, and that ""a lady"" would stay with her until her parents arrived from Perth the following Tuesday, and that her boyfriend would arrive home from overseas on the Wednesday.  Their plans were then to leave Sydney to live in London (where the boyfriend had rugby league commitments) ""for a couple of years"".
193Ms Baltra-Vasquez observed the appellant with Tegan present.  She thought that ""it looked like the normal mother and things"", and made a note that the appellant:
""... is happy with her baby girl, breastfeeding her."" 
194It was not suggested that Ms Baltra-Vasquez's evidence was in any way inaccurate.  The information provided to her by the appellant was, in many respects, untrue.  The appellant had not been born in Perth.  Her parents did not live in Perth but did, in fact, live in Fairlight in Sydney.  Her boyfriend, Duncan Gillies, had had no part in the planning of the pregnancy and was unaware of it.  He was also unaware of the birth of Tegan.  He was not overseas playing rugby league at the time of the birth: two days later, on 14 September, he accompanied the appellant to a wedding in Manly.
195On 14 September 1996, at some time between 11am and 12 noon the appellant discharged herself from the hospital, taking Tegan with her.  She did not submit Tegan for identification checks, as she had been requested to do.  An Auburn Hospital nurse arranged for the appellant to be followed up by the Ryde Domiciliary Midwife Program.  
196The appellant arrived at her parents' home at about 3pm on 14 September.  She did not have Tegan with her.  Mr Gillies arrived shortly after, and the appellant's mother drove the couple to a wedding at Manly.  Mr Gillies noticed nothing untoward about the appellant's behaviour.
197On 16 September the appellant telephoned the Ryde Domiciliary Midwife Program to inform them that she would not be needing their services.  She said that her ""home birth midwife"" would take over her care.  No midwife made contact with Auburn Hospital, as would have been expected.
198On 19 September Tegan was enrolled on the appellant's Medicare card.  No claim for medical or pharmaceutical expenses for her has ever been made.  
199The appellant and Duncan Gillies continued in their relationship until about March 1998, when they separated.  In the second half of 1998, the appellant began a relationship with another man, to whom we will refer as AH.  The appellant was still living with her parents at Fairlight.  In August of that year the appellant was again pregnant.  She did not tell AH of her pregnancy, nor did she tell her parents or her friends.  In February 1999 she sought advice, in Brisbane, with respect to the termination of the pregnancy, but was told that the pregnancy was too far advanced.  The appellant gave her parents' address, and her correct date of birth.  She said that she was separated, occupied in home duties, and a mother.  Much of this was untrue.
200On 21 May 1999 the appellant was admitted to Ryde Hospital, telling staff she was 39 weeks pregnant.  She gave the name of Lisa Andreatta as an emergency contact person.  She told staff at Ryde Hospital that she had been booked into the Royal Women's Hospital in Brisbane for the birth, and had received antenatal care at that hospital; she was currently in Sydney with an older child and was not accompanied by any other family member; that she had breast fed her baby girl born at Auburn for six months; that she was living with friends at 10 Venus Street, Gladesville; that her parents were living in London; and that her partner was in London.  None of this was true.
201In the early hours of 31 May 1999 the appellant was re-admitted to Ryde Hospital and gave birth to AJ later that morning.  Later DNA tests established that AH was the father of AJ.  The appellant repeated that in 1996 she had given birth to a baby girl, whom she said she had breast fed for six months; she said that the child was well. 
202On 1 June 1999 the appellant contacted Anglicare Adoption Services for the purpose of surrendering AJ for adoption.  She told Ms Elliott, a principal officer of Anglicare, that she had travelled from London to have the baby in Sydney and surrender him for adoption, and that she had received counselling while in England.  This was not true.
203Ms Fung assumed responsibility for supervising and completing the adoption process.  The process did not go smoothly.  This was largely because the appellant gave a great deal of false information, some parts of it inconsistent with other parts.  The appellant was difficult for Ms Fung to contact.  
204The dealings with Ms Fung were extensive and continued over many weeks.  The appellant told Ms Fung that she was due to start work in London in mid June and might stay (in Australia) for another two weeks.  She said that her ""ex partner"" was in London and that he had left her when she was five months pregnant, that he was aware of the birth of AJ, and that she had discussed with him the prospect of adoption.  Ms Fung queried whether the appellant's parents were aware of the pregnancy.  On 3 June 1999 the appellant signed a foster care agreement for a one month period, and AJ was given into the care of a foster couple.
205The appellant told Ms Fung that the father of AJ was Duncan Gillies, from whom she was separated.  She gave a London address for him.  She gave her address as 10 Venus Street, Gladesville and also gave a London address for herself.  She said that she had not lived with her parents since she was 17 years old.  On a later occasion, she gave Ms Fung the name of AJ's father as ""AW"".
206On 13 September 1999 the appellant swore an affidavit in which she said (falsely) that the father of AJ was AW, that she had met AW in London, where they both resided, and that she was unable to contact AW.  The false statements in this affidavit were the foundation for the third charge of perjury on the indictment.
207The appellant engaged with Ms Fung over a period from early June 1999 until the beginning of September of that year.  In June, she told Ms Fung that Mr Gillies had frozen their joint bank account in London, leaving her without access to funds.  She said that she had been in contact with her employer in London, who had agreed that she could remain in Australia until mid July.  She said that she hoped that her mother would be able to come to Australia in order to accompany her on her return to London.
208Ms Fung found it increasingly difficult to contact the appellant.  Various telephone numbers the appellant supplied were incorrect: by way of example, she gave one telephone number as that of Lisa Andreatta's grandmother.  When Ms Fung rang the number, the telephone was answered by a mortgage company.  The appellant's mobile phone that she used was almost invariably switched off or unanswered.  The appellant gave many explanations for not being available for consultations with Ms Fung.  These centred around what she claimed was her need to make arrangements for re-entry to Britain, including travel to Canberra.    
209Ms Fung later ascertained that the address of 70 Venus Street, Gladesville, given by the appellant to the Ryde Hospital as her temporary address, did not exist.
210Eventually, in July, Ms Fung contacted the Department of Community Services in Katoomba.  She was concerned about the legal status of AJ.  The foster care agreement signed by the appellant was about to expire, and Ms Fung could not contact the appellant to extend it.  Mr John Borovnik was assigned as AJ's caseworker, for the purpose of obtaining a care order.
211In the course of his investigations, Mr Borovnik obtained the appellant's medical records from the Ryde Hospital, which disclosed the appellant's 1996 pregnancy.  This led to the discovery of Tegan's birth at the Auburn Hospital.  On 18 October 1999 Mr Borovnik contacted the appellant and asked her if she had given birth to a child at Auburn Hospital in 1996.  The appellant said that she had not.  Mr Borovnik asked if she had given birth to a child in 1995, and she confirmed that she had.  Mr Borovnik asked the appellant if she were sure that she had not given birth in 1996, and she assured him that she was.  She also denied having attended Ryde Hospital at about that time in a pregnant condition.  She said that she was not pregnant at that time.  Mr Borovnik told the appellant that he would have to pass the information to the police.  The appellant also told Ms Fung that she had had no children other than TR and AJ.
212On 20 October 1999 the appellant wrote to Mr Borovnik, in the following terms:
""John,
I received all of the information.  I will be speaking to Virginia Fung on either Friday or Monday and will discuss those facts.  Many people have been involved by name, who actually, have no knowledge of what has occurred and therefore are useless in your inquiries.  Please do not contact them before giving me prior notice as they will be completely unaware of what you are talking about.  There is no use concerning them with issues that they have no knowledge of, in particular Julie Melville & Duncan Gillies.  I suggest you contact Virginia Fung after Monday 25/10/99 to confirm facts."" (Ex LLL)
213On 25 October 1999 the appellant sent by facsimile a letter to Ms Fung.  It is too lengthy a letter to be fully reproduced here.  However, it is necessary to reproduce substantial extracts:
""Dear Virginia,
Firstly, thankyou for all of your time, your patience and your understanding even though I have not been entirely honest with you.  I'm glad now that I can stop telling half truths and lies and perhaps move on in my life.  You are the first person in a long time who has reached out to help me without me feeling like I was being judged.  It must be very hard for you to understand what has been going on and why I have done the things I've done and I'm not sure I can give you all the answers.  Over all of these weeks my main concern was [AJ] and making sure that he was safe and happy and that you would find him a loving and secure home.
So where do I start?  I'm not sure?  My life for the last 6 years has been a nightmare ... Many people, including my family, have disowned me and looking at the situation I guess it's not hard to figure out why.  There were 3 children obviously I can't lie anymore as the paperwork is there.  The middle child lives with a family in Perth although I have not had contact with them for along time.  They befriended me just before I had her and supported us.  I am not able to give you many details as I am not sure of them myself.  If my story isn't unusual enough as it already is!  I know you probably can't believe it but I know somehow that you know I am now being honest with you ..."" (italics added) (Ex YY)
Even in this letter, the appellant was not being truthful with Ms Fung.  For example, her family had not disowned her.  (Whether there was any reasonable possibility that it was true that ""the middle child"" (Tegan) in 1999 lived ""with a family in Perth"" was a question the jury had to consider.)  In the letter the appellant maintained the fiction that her parents lived in London.  She said:
""Perhaps in the future we could become closer again and reform the ties I broke with them so long ago.  I'm not sure?  I would like to see them when I go over in December but I'm not sure if they'll see me or not.""
She claimed that:
""People dropped off me when they realised that I was going to relinquish the babies.""
(There was no evidence of anybody, other than hospital staff, who was aware of the birth of the children or the adoptions of TR and AJ.  The evidence was to the contrary: that the appellant had successfully concealed all of her pregnancies from her family and friends.)
214On 4 November 1999 Mr Borovnik reported the matter to Katoomba Police.  The precise terms of his report are not in evidence.  On 8 November 1999 the appellant again wrote by facsimile to Mr Borovnik (Ex LLL) giving him her ""adjusted contact numbers"", and adding:
""Your discretion is essential & appreciated.""
215The police investigation was transferred from Katoomba Police Station to the Manly Police Station where it came under the supervision of Detective Mathew Kehoe.  Detective Kehoe made various inquiries and the appellant was interviewed on 14 February 2001.  The interview was electronically recorded.  Inter alia, the following questions were asked and answers given:
""Q23 As I've explained to you, we're investigating a, a report forwarded to us by the Katoomba Children's Court in relation to the birth and subsequent adoption of, of that child.  Can you, in your words, can you just explain to us the circumstances of when the child was born and what happened subsequent to that?A After a brief affair with the father of the child I gave birth.  We made an arrangement that he would come and take custody of Tegan as I was unable to take care of her myself, and he dropped me home and then took Tegan with him into his care.  
Q24 O.K.  And you told me that the person that you, that is the natural father of the child is an Andrew Morris.  Is that correct?A That's correct.
Q25 Now you don't know where he is at the present time?A No, I don't.
Q26 You believe he previously lived in Balmain?A That's right.
Q27 And you believe that his date of birth is sometime in August, 1966?A Perhaps a little earlier ... maybe July, August.
...
Q32 Now you also explained to me that he, during that time in 1996 that he had a partner that lived with him.A That's right, Mel.
Q33 And are you aware of her full name?A No, I'm not.
... [The appellant then agreed that she had attended Ryde Hospital prior to the birth of Tegan, and that the baby was born on 12 September 1996.]
Q40 And you were referred to the hospital by a home birth midwife.  Is that correct?A No, it's not correct.
Q41 All right.  Can you tell me who Julie Melville is?A Yep, she was the mother of the, um, guy I was seeing at the time, who was a midwife.
... [The appellant said that she left the Auburn Hospital at sometime before midday on 14 September, a Saturday.]
Q47 And when you were at the hospital did anybody visit you out there?...A Oh, sorry, sorry.  Yes, I was visited on 2 days by Andrew and Mel and Andrew's mother.  Sorry.
...
Q50 And what was the purpose of their visit?A To make arrangements for Andrew to take custody of Tegan.
Q51 O.K.  And, and what arrangements were made for him to take custody of her?A He was to arrange to have a car seat organised so he could take Tegan home, he was to take me home, and then he would go home with Tegan.
Q52 Right, O.K.  To your knowledge is there any reason why Andrew wanted to adopt or care for Tegan?A Well, he's the natural father and I was unable to, to take custody of her myself, and that was very clear from March in '96 when I found out I was pregnant, and I had made that clear to him and that was part of the, the, you know, agreement between us, for me to carry the baby to full term.
Q53 O.K.  When did you first meet Andrew?A I met him in December, '95.
Q54 Are you aware if his partner has any kind of medical problem or she can't have children, or is that perhaps the reason, or ---A No, it was just by choice because I was not able to have a child at the time, mentally or financially, I wasn't capable and wasn't prepared to keep Tegan and, and Andrew was, and he earned good money and he had a partner.  That to me seemed, they seemed to have a pretty, they had a future together.  Well, they indicated to me that they were gunna be together and I thought that would be more suitable than me on my own at Uni and ---
...
Q57 And as you've explained to me beforehand, on the day you were discharged from hospital Andrew came to the hospital.  Is that right?A That's correct.
Q58 And they dropped you to, they dropped you home to Gladesville.A That's right.
Q59 And what address did they drop you to in Gladesville?A 10 Venus Street, Gladesville.
Q60 And, and Andrew took Tegan home with him.A That's right.
Q61 And I think you've explained to me beforehand that you saw Tegan on a number of occasions after that.A That's right.
Q62 And when was the last time that you saw her?A Oh, approximately, it would have been about 3 or 4 months later.
Q63 And when was the last occasion that you spoke with either Andrew or Melanie?A Either January or February of '97.
Q64 O.K.  Now I think you've explained that you don't have an address for, for Andrew.  Is that right?A No, I don't know where he is.
... 
Q68 Do you have any other friends that may know where he is at the moment?A No, the people that are in my life now weren't necessarily around then.  They wouldn't have known him.
Q69 O.K.  Are there any other people who knew of Andrew that you might be able to get in contact with that might know of his whereabouts now?A Yeah, quite possibly.
...
Q71 ... Now you showed us beforehand that you had, you have Tegan's details on your Medicare card.  A That's correct, yeah.
Q72 And can you just explain the reason why her details are on your card?A That would be because when I filled out the registration forms in the hospital I went through them with a nurse and she had the official sticker or whatever it was, it may be, all the paperwork together, and I filled out the registration forms and signed them, and also signed a form for Medicare to, in future in case Tegan was with me and I needed to take her to the doctor's or something ..."" (Ex NNN)
216In October 2002 Detective Richard Gaut took over the investigation.  On 16 October Detective Gaut had a conversation with the appellant.  This conversation was not recorded.  However, Detective Gaut made notes of the conversation.  He introduced himself to the appellant, and asked ""the circumstances of who you gave the child to and how it was given over"".  The appellant replied:
""I gave it to the father Andrew Norris.""
217The appellant then told Detective Gaut that Andrew Norris, his mother and his girlfriend Melanie had come to Auburn Hospital when she was discharged and picked the child up from there.  She said that she had caught a taxi home to Gladesville by herself.  Detective Gaut noted that this was different, in two respects, from what the appellant had told Detective Kehoe.  These were the name given to the father of the child - Norris, not Morris, and the circumstances in which she said that she had returned to her home.  He challenged the appellant about this.  She denied having used the name ""Morris"" to Detective Kehoe and insisted that she had spoken of Andrew Norris.  Detective Gaut also asked her about the different accounts she had given about how she travelled home to Gladesville - she had told Detective Kehoe that Andrew Morris, with his partner and mother, had driven her to Gladesville; but she told Detective Gaut that she had travelled by taxi.  The appellant explained:
""... I told him that because that's what I wanted to happen.  He hated me.  I felt like a slut.  I wanted to make it sound better, the fact that they didn't - they didn't care about me."" 
218The appellant gave Detective Gaut a description of Andrew Norris.  She said that he would (in 2002) have been about 36 years of age (that is, born in about 1966) had bleached blonde hair, was well built, with a tanned complexion, worked in the finance industry or in banking.  She thought he had attended Sydney University.
219Detective Gaut asked the appellant about the existence of anybody who could verify the existence of Andrew Norris, and knew about the birth and the fact that she had handed Tegan to that person.  The appellant replied:
""There was a lot of people I used to hang around back then who aren't in my life now.""
220She identified a Lisa Andreatta from Brisbane as a friend of Andrew's who knew about the birth, and who also knew Andrew's partner Mel.  Ms Lisa Andreatta met the appellant in 1996 as a fellow student at the Australian College of Physical Education in Homebush.  During that year they became friends.  Ms Andreatta met Duncan Gillies, who she understood to be the appellant's boyfriend.  The appellant never told Ms Andreatta that she was having a relationship either with Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris, nor anybody whose first name was Andrew.  The appellant never introduced Ms Andreatta to a man named Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris.  Ms Andreatta had never lived in Brisbane.
221The following day, 17 October, the appellant telephoned Detective Gaut and told him that she was intending to go to the Gladesville address (10 Venus Street) to attempt to locate old diaries containing phone numbers of friends who could verify her account of Andrew Norris.  Detective Gaut did not hear from the appellant over the next three weeks, and, on 7 November, he telephoned her to ask how her inquiries were proceeding.  She told him that at that point she had been unable to find any contact numbers but was intending to go to the Gladesville address (10 Venus Street) on Saturday, 9 November to look through old boxes containing diaries with phone numbers of mutual friends.  Detective Gaut asked her to call him by Monday, 11 November.  She did not do so.  Detective Gaut made a number of attempts to contact the appellant and eventually did so.  On one occasion (22 November) she told him that she was not in a position to speak, but would call back in 20 minutes.  She did not do so.
222On 13 December 2002 Detective Gaut received from the appellant a hand written letter.  The appellant advised him of her intention to travel to the United Kingdom with her then partner and daughter.  Later, she provided Detective Gaut with details of her travel arrangements.
223On 2 December 2002, with another detective, Detective Gaut went to 10 Venus Street, Gladesville where he spoke to two of the three women then living at that address.  They told him that nobody had come to the house to search through old boxes of papers.
224On 3 January 2003, Detective Gaut and a dog handler went to that address with a cadaver dog for the purpose of investigating whether any human remains were on the property.  The search yielded no result.
225On 9 May 2003 the appellant was again interviewed, this time by Detective Gaut, at the Manly Police Station.  The interview was electronically recorded.  
226Detective Gaut asked the appellant to confirm that, on 16 October 2002, she had given the name of Tegan's father as Andrew Norris.  She did not agree with that.  When further questions were asked, the appellant said [A67]:
""I made a mistake, yes, I, I told Detective Kehoe one name and I told you a different name.""
227The interview was a lengthy one.  The following questions and answers are significant:
""Q96 ... Is it true that when you were at the hospital, that his [Andrew Morris/Norris] mother came to the hospital?A That's true.
Q97 That's true?  And is it true that his, his girlfriend or his wife at the time, Melanie, or Mel ---A Mel.
Q97 --- she also came to the hospital?A Yes.
Q98 How many times did they come to the hospital?A They only came to, to pick Tegan up, but Andrew had been once before.
...""
228In response to a specific question by Detective Gaut, the appellant said that she had gone through boxes at her old address, 10 Venus Street, Gladesville.  That, she said, occurred in November 2002.  Immediately after that, she said that she had been unable to go through the boxes, because the tenants refused her access.
229Detective Gaut then asked a number of questions about the notes taken by Ms Baltra-Vasquez at Auburn Hospital.  The appellant agreed that, although she had told Ms Baltra-Vasquez that she had been born in Perth and her parents still lived there, that was not true.  She agreed that she had ""probably"" told Ms Baltra-Vasquez that her boyfriend was a good caring man and the pregnancy had been planned, and that this was not true.  With respect to her statement to Ms Baltra-Vasquez that, on her discharge from hospital, ""a lady"" would come to stay with her, she said:
""A222 But by that stage, I knew that Andrew was taking Tegan, so I was going to be on my own.""
230Detective Gaut asked the appellant about her statements to Ms Fung that AJ was her first child.  She said this was because she thought Ms Fung would not help her, would judge her and would not help AJ.  He asked her about the letter to Ms Fung in which the appellant had claimed that ""the middle child"" (Tegan) lived with a family in Perth.  When asked if that was true, the appellant said:
""A292  I'm not sure where they are.""
Detective Gaut asked why she said they were in Perth, and asked if she had believed that the family were in Perth.  The appellant answered:
""A294  I wasn't sure what Andrew was going to do.""
231The appellant told Detective Gaut that the reference to ""the Perth family"" was a reference to Mel and Andrew.  The following questions and answers are pertinent:
""Q297 Do you agree that it says 'they befriended me'?A Yes.
Q298 O.K, 'just before I had her and supported us'.A Yes.  I -
Q299 Well, do you agree that if, if you had an affair with Andrew, who, who you knew well before you had the child ---A But I didn't know Mel at all.
Q300 Why did you say they lived in Perth?A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)
Q301 Well, do you agree that you've never told the police that you believe that they live in Perth?A Sorry?
Q302 Do you agree that you've never told the police, while we're trying to find out where, where Norris is living, you've never mentioned him living in Perth?A No.  I, I never have.
Q303 Can you tell us why?A No.
Q304 Do you believe he lives in Perth?A I'm not sure.  I'm not sure what his plans were.  He wasn't going to tell me.
Q305 Can you tell me why you told Virgina Fung that, that the child lives in Perth with a family?A Some of the conversations I had with Andrew indicated perhaps he wasn't going to stay in Sydney because of the embarrassment that I'd caused him and, or could cause him, I guess.
Q306 Did he, did he ever say he was going to Perth?A Not direct, not directly, amongst other, he just said, I can't, I don't know, somewhere, something along the lines of I don't know how I could stay in Sydney, what will everyone think, it's such an embarrassment.  For him.  It's an embarrassment for him."" (Ex PPP)
Detective Gaut asked the appellant directly if she had killed Tegan, which the appellant denied.
232Detective Gaut asked the appellant about the inclusion of Tegan on her Medicare card, and the absence of any claims made with respect to her.  She said that she filled out ""the paperwork"" and gave it to Andrew Morris/Norris.  He asked about her claim that Lisa Andreatta was aware of the relationship and the birth of Tegan.  The following questions were asked and answers given:
""Q352 You didn't think it might be important that she was the one person who could verify the fact that ---A But I know she doesn't know where he is. 
Q353 Yeah, but you, you agree that you said that she knew about the child and she knew about the, who the father was and all that and that she could verify that? ... Do you agree with that?A Yes.
...
Q355 All right.  So, you didn't think, it, this could put it all to rest, if you were to allow police to speak with her?A I don't, I don't want to have her involved, I don't, she's overseas and I don't want her to, I just thought you would speak with him and it would be fine and she wouldn't have to be involved and -
Q356 Mm.  Well, I, I've spoken with Lisa and she states that she doesn't know any Andrew Norris and she also doesn't know anything about you having a child in 1996.  Keli, it's obviously from what you've telling myself and other people, all right, that you're not telling us the truth.  Now, this matter is not a matter that's going to go away.A I know it's not going to go away, but I don't want to hurt everybody around me."" (Ex PPP)
233The appellant maintained that Tegan was with Andrew Norris.  She said:
""A361  I thought, I know she didn't know, about the baby, but she, I, I am sure she knew who Andrew was, because we used to, she used to be there when he was there."" (Ex PPP)
234Detective Gaut then asked the appellant again to nominate anybody who knew about her relationship with Andrew Norris or who knew that she had had a child with him.  The appellant did not reply.
235Following this interview, the appellant agreed to accompany detectives to Balmain in an attempt to locate the apartment block in which she had said that Andrew Norris lived.  She gave a general description of the area where she claimed to have visited Andrew Norris.  This excursion took place on 19 May 2003.  After driving around the area for a time, the appellant identified an apartment block in Wisbeach Street, Balmain as having features similar to that where she said she had conducted her liaison with Andrew Norris.  They entered the block and, from the outside, the appellant identified the apartment she said she believed to have been occupied by Norris.  
236The appellant said that Andrew Norris lived in the apartment with his girlfriend Melanie, who, the appellant understood, worked in retail, but who was never present when the appellant visited.  She said that Melanie's possessions were in the apartment.
237Detective Gaut was able to gain access to one of the apartments in the block, which the appellant said was directly underneath the apartment occupied by Andrew Norris, and was identical in layout.  She told Detective Gaut that, on two or three mornings after she had stayed with Norris, she had walked to the nearby Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool for water polo training.
238As part of his investigation Detective Gaut made contact with some friends of the appellant.  A couple called Brandon and Melinda Ward, who had known the appellant since childhood, were among those contacted.  Mr and Mrs Ward told the appellant of the inquiries, saying:
""A detective has been ringing us asking us about a missing baby that you've had.  We have no idea what he is talking about.  We thought we would make you aware of this."" 
The appellant replied:
""It has nothing to do with you, it is something between Duncan, Narelle and Simon."" 
239Simon Gillies was Duncan Gillies' brother.  He and his wife Narelle had had difficulty conceiving and she had given birth to a still born child in February 1998.  The appellant had visited her in hospital.  There was no arrangement between Simon and Narelle Gillies and the appellant in relation to a baby born in 1996.
240On 7 January 2004 Detective Gaut visited the appellant at her home, in company with Detective Edgtton.  A conversation ensued that was not recorded.  Detective Gaut made it plain that he did not wish, in an unrecorded conversation, to discuss matters the subject of the investigation.  The appellant told Detective Gaut that, as she had not heard from him for months, she was wondering why he had not contacted her.  The appellant protested that Detective Gaut had contacted a number of her friends and acquaintances.  She maintained that she had given Tegan away.  Eventually, the appellant agreed to a further recorded interview at the Manly Police Station.
241That interview took place the following day, 8 January 2004.  The appellant told Detective Gaut that she was confident that Duncan Gillies was not the father of the child, because, at about the time of conception, they had abstained from sexual relations.  She said that Andrew Norris reacted with hostility when she told him that she was pregnant, and that, thereafter, she had virtually no contact with him, until after Tegan's birth.  Shortly after saying that, she said that there had been some face to face contact during that time, and that Andrew Norris had remained hostile, accusing her of ""trapping"" him.
242She said that the arrangement for Andrew Norris and his partner ""Mel"" to take the baby was made on a Friday in September, after Tegan's birth, and while the appellant remained in the hospital.
243The appellant said that she had a lengthy conversation with Andrew Norris when she first informed him of her pregnancy, and then had no further contact with him until she telephoned him from the hospital after which he, with his mother and partner Melanie, came to the hospital to take Tegan.
244What followed thereafter was a painstaking, meticulous and exhaustive investigation initially under the supervision of Detective Gaut.  The investigation began by focussing upon determining: (i) whether there was any realistic possibility that Tegan was alive, and (ii) an attempt to identify the Andrew Morris/Norris to whom the appellant claimed to have given the baby.  The searches for Andrew Morris/Norris included:
electoral rolls for a person of those names living in the Balmain/Rozelle area in 1996;University of Sydney records for persons of that name enrolled in the last 20 years with birth dates between 1960 and 1970;NSW Water Polo Association, and various water polo clubs, records;Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) records;Centrelink records;Australia Post records;Department of Fair Trading records regarding the lodgement of rental bonds;police records concerning reports of missing persons by the name Andrew Norris;Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages records for persons called Andrew Norris born between 1960 and 1976.
None of these searches yielded any person who could have been the Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris of whom the appellant had spoken.  By examining Australia wide electoral, Australian Taxation Office, police, RTA, NSW Births, Deaths and Marriages, Department of Immigration, telephone records and records of electricity providers in the Balmain/Rozelle area, 41 men by the name of Andrew Norris in Australia with birth dates between 1960 and 1976 were identified.  Statements taken from each of those that could be contacted.  The results were detailed in Ex AU.
245It is unnecessary here to detail the meticulous searches undertaken by Detective Gaut with the assistance of other police.  It is sufficient to say that those searches produced no Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris who could have been the father of Tegan. 246On a direction from the NSW Coroner, in July 2005, Detective Gaut had searches undertaken of Births, Deaths and Marriages Registry records throughout Australia for women named ""Mel"", or variations thereof - Melanie, Melissa, Melinda - registered as the parent of a female child born in September 1996.  This search yielded no mother or child who could have been the ""Mel"" who the appellant said was the partner of Andrew Norris; nor did it yield any child who could have been Tegan.  A search was also conducted for any child in Australia who could have been Tegan.  This search began with Births, Deaths and Marriages records, covering children born between 31 March 1996 and 30 September 1997.  More than 12,000 births were investigated.  No child who could have been Tegan was identified.  Searches were undertaken of NSW and interstate Births, Deaths and Marriages registries for a female child whose father's name was given as Andrew Norris.  Those searches yielded no results.  Searches were undertaken of foundlings, and adoptions, again with no results.
247Requests were issued to heads of all authorities responsible for government, Catholic, independent, and home schooling in each State and Territory for any female child born on 12 September 1996 with a father named Andrew Norris or Andrew Morris.  Nothing was produced.
248Investigations were undertaken by the Unsolved Homicide Division of the NSW Police Service (who took over the investigation in September 2006), sometimes, perhaps, duplicating those already conducted.  These investigations identified more than 1000 children for more detailed investigation, as possibly Tegan Lane under a different name.  All were excluded as being Tegan.  A review of Detective Gaut's investigation was undertaken in mid 2007, and many of the inquiries he had made were repeated.
249Detective Gaut followed up a number of statements made by the appellant over the years.  These included statements made to Centacare, Ms Fung, Mr Borovnik, and also Detective Kehoe and Detective Gaut in the three interviews in which the appellant participated.  One such statement was that, the mornings after she stayed with Andrew Norris at Wisbeach Street, the appellant had walked to the Dawn Fraser Pool for water polo training.  What emerged from the investigation was that, in fact, morning training sessions were held at Homebush.  It was evening training sessions that were held at the Dawn Fraser Pool.  
250An equally comprehensive investigation was conducted into the 1995-1996 occupants of the apartment block in Wisbeach Street, identified by the appellant as the address where she had visited Andrew Morris/Norris.  All apartments in the block were owned by one company, and managed by a single real estate agency.  The agency had no record of any lease to, or payment made by, a person called Morris or Norris.
251The persons who had occupied the two apartments identified by the appellant as possibly that where she had visited Andrew Morris/Norris were contacted.  Each provided information that excluded any real possibility that he was the person with whom the appellant had had ""a brief affair"".
252One of the tenants in the block claimed to have seen mail addressed to both Andrew Morris and Andrew Norris in the mailbox for Apartment 10.  However, cross-examination established that this evidence was of dubious (if any) reliability.
253Department of Immigration records were searched for passport applications for female children aged under 12 months between 14 September 1996 and 31 December 1996.  The search produced no passport application for a child who could have been Tegan.
254In 2008, under the supervision of Senior Constable Rachelle Gambino, a more expansive school search was undertaken.  No child who could have been Tegan was identified.
255In all, more than 86,000 births in NSW between 31 March 1996 and 30 September 1997 were cross-checked against hospital records.  No child who could have been Tegan was discovered.
256In 2004 and 2005 the police strategy included the use of media to attract attention to the investigation.  The express purpose was to elicit information from the public.  All information provided was followed up.  No person who could have been the Andrew Morris/Norris of whom the appellant spoke was discovered.  No child who could have been Tegan was discovered.
The trial 
257It is of some importance to note the manner in which the trial was conducted on behalf of the appellant.
258Following the Crown opening, senior counsel for the appellant opened the defence case at some length.  He identified areas of evidence in dispute.  With respect to the issues he said:
""What's in dispute in the case is the very essence, if I can deal with the first count, the very essence of the charge of murder.  The dispute, the difference between the defence and the prosecution, is that the defence says, 'This woman, the accused, has never killed anybody in her life.  Never.' ...
So the defence dispute with the Crown is that, firstly, there never has been, certainly in the way it's described by the prosecutor, or to the knowledge of the accused, any murder of anybody connected with her, in particular baby Tegan Lane.
... 
... our case is they can't prove how, when, where or even why Keli Lane would murder her newborn child; but further, they can't even prove that that child is dead.  And further, they can't prove, if that child is dead, the manner of the death.
...
So, members of the jury, the first and perhaps fundamental difference, dispute or difference, between the defence and the prosecution is that our submission to you will be the Crown can't prove her death, the Crown can't prove the manner of her death, the Crown can't prove that any act was done by the accused in relation to Tegan Lane that either was done when she intended to cause Tegan's death or to do her serious bodily harm.
..."" 
259In particular, senior counsel disputed the Crown case with respect to the motive attributed to the appellant - that motive was that she was fixated upon an international sporting career and did not wish to be encumbered by the responsibility for a child.
260Further, senior counsel pointed out that, even to the extent that the appellant's history showed that she was not prepared to accept responsibility for a child, on four occasions (three before and one after the birth of Tegan) the appellant had employed lawful and responsible methods of achieving that end - on two occasions she had had pregnancies terminated, and on two she had surrendered children for adoption.
261In respect of Tegan, senior counsel said:
""... she took the responsible course with baby Tegan, giving it to the natural father."" 
In taking this course, it was plain that the appellant maintained her position, as she had in the interviews with Detectives Kehoe and Gaut, that she had given Tegan to Andrew Morris/Norris.
262These were the issues to which the jury was alerted at the commencement of the trial.  There was no variation to that during the course of the trial.
263One thing that emerges from the above account of the Crown case is the repeated provision of false information by the appellant over many years, and in circumstances not related to the birth, disposal, or death of Tegan.  It is relevant to note that only three of the false statements were presented to the jury as lies evidencing consciousness of guilt (Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193).  These were:
the statement in the letter to Ms Fung that Tegan was living with a couple in Perth;the statement to Detective Kehoe that the appellant had given Tegan to Andrew Morris;the statement to Detective Gaut that the appellant had given Tegan to Andrew Norris.
264These were the subject of the decision of this Court in R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157; 221 A Crim R 309.  His Honour gave appropriate directions to the jury, and no issue arises on this appeal concerning the admission of the evidence or the directions given to the jury.
265The other false statements attributed to the appellant were relevant to the assessment of her credibility.  This had a particular poignancy because, the appellant not having given evidence in the trial, reliance had to be placed upon what she had previously said.  It would be difficult to assign any probative value at all to anything said by the appellant concerning the investigation.  
266During the course of the trial the jury were given written directions with respect to murder, perjury (and false swearing), and the use of lies as consciousness of guilt.  Those concerning murder were in the following terms:
""1.  The crime of murder has been committed by the accused if the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt each of the following:
a)  the death of Tegan Lane;
b)  that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of Tegan Lane; and
c)  that the act causing death was done by the accused with an intention to kill Tegan Lane.
NOTE:  If the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt as to each of these ingredients, you will find the accused guilty of murder.
2.  If the Crown has not satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt of the death of Tegan Lane, you must find the accused not guilty and acquit her of murder.
3.  If the Crown has not satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of Tegan Lane, you must find the accused not guilty and acquit her of murder.
4.  If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was done by the accused with intent on her part to kill Tegan Lane, you must find the accused not guilty and acquit her of murder.""
267The Crown case on motive was put to the jury in final address by the Crown prosecutor in the following words:
""Firstly, we have evidence of motive.  Mainly, evidence of long-term motive.  Her sporting life, her social life, educational career, her job, her Olympic ambitions, her overwhelming fear of rejection by her family and friends that would bring shame on her."" 
The Crown prosecutor went on to speak in some detail of the evidence supporting the assertion that the appellant was driven by ""Olympic ambitions"", and other evidence supporting the contention that she was motivated by an ""overwhelming fear of rejection"".
268The Crown also placed some emphasis on the evidence submitted as tendency evidence, concerning the appellant's disposal of prior and subsequent pregnancies, whether by termination, or by adoption.  Senior counsel for the appellant countered this by again reminding the jury that the tendency disclosed was, not to murder or engage in other criminal conduct, but to adopt lawful means of ensuring that the appellant was not responsible for children.
269Senior counsel who represented the appellant at trial addressed the jury comprehensively and in considerable detail on the evidence.  A central theme that recurred through the address was a challenge to the inference, essential to the Crown case, that Tegan was dead.
270About midway through his address he put a series of numbered propositions to the jury.  These included the following: 
""Point number one is that we do not even know that the victim is dead.  Point number two is if she's dead, we don't know how she died.  There's no scientific evidence at all.  There's nothing. Nobody can tell us anything, not one word in this case.
'We don't know' number three is this, members of the jury: I haven't even got to the investigation and the evidence in the case yet directly.  Number three is if she's dead, that is, Tegan Lane, we don't know who caused the death if anyone did because we don't know.  It could have been an accident and people do terrible things to cover things up.
... that these next matters are absolutely as critical as the first point which we suggest is 'we don't know'.  We do not even know that Tegan Lane is dead. 
Point number four: If Tegan Lane is dead we don't know that it was the deliberate act of Keli Lane that caused her death.
Number five: We don't know that if Tegan is dead and the ability (sic - act) of Keli Lane caused her death, we don't know that it was done with the intention to kill her."" 
271The remaining points were largely argumentative.  Senior counsel questioned the motive hypothesised by the Crown for murder, and suggested that the motive proposed was equally a motive for the appellant to have Tegan adopted, or to give her to the natural father.  He made a significant attack on the quality of the police investigation, describing it as ""so poor"", lacking urgency, being ""shoved onto the back burner"" and ""passed from policeman to policeman"".  
The appeal
272The submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant began by reiterating the written directions given to the jury, concerning what was essential to be proved in the Crown case:
(a)  the death of Tegan Lane;
(b)  that it was the deliberate act of the appellant who caused the death of Tegan Lane; and
(c)  that the act causing death was done by the appellant with an intention to kill Tegan Lane.
273The task of an appellate court in considering a ground that a conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence remains as stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.  The question the court must ask itself is:
""... whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."":
M at 493.  In answering that question:
""... the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.  On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 
274The adequacy of the Crown case to support the charge of murder was attacked on three fronts: 
the evidence said to establish motive, which, it was contended, was ""weak"", or even ""extremely weak"";
the evidence said to establish the mens rea necessary for the offence of murder (in this case, as pointed out above, the Crown relied only on intention to kill and discarded the other states of mind which may, in another case, be sufficient for a conviction for murder);
the tendency evidence, being, essentially, the appellant's history, both pre- and post- the birth of Tegan, to avoid accepting responsibility for the care of a child.
275In written submissions directed to this ground it was proposed that the Crown was not able to exclude either manslaughter, or other reasonable hypotheses consistent with the innocence of the appellant.  Those ""innocent hypotheses"" were identified as accidental death, infanticide, that the child was given away to a known person (Andrew Morris/Norris) and that the child was given away to a person unknown.  On the hearing of the appeal the first and second of these (accidental death and infanticide) were expressly disavowed.  
276We do not accept the proposition that the evidence said to establish motive was weak.  There was strong evidence that the appellant did not wish to accept responsibility for a child.  In any event, it is not essential that the Crown establish a motive; evidence tending to establish motive was, in this case, one of many elements making up a circumstantial case.  It was not necessary that it be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Even if it were correct to characterise that evidence as weak, that does not diminish the strength of the numerous other items of evidence in the Crown case that were not explained.
277We turn to the specific questions posed to the jury.
(i) Did the Crown prove that Tegan was dead?
278Given the way the trial was conducted, there were really only two alternatives available for the jury to consider.  Either, as the Crown contended, Tegan was dead, or, as was contended on behalf of the appellant, she had been handed by the appellant to her natural father, whether named Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris.  In this context, the appellant's denial to Mr Borovnik, repeated to Ms Fung, that she had given birth to a child in 1996, was significant.  It is also to be recalled that the appellant told the Ryde Domiciliary Midwife Program that she would not require their services.  She said this was because she had made ""home birth midwife"" arrangements to take over Tegan's care.  She did not suggest that the child had been taken by her father.  Significant also was her subsequent explanation to Ms Fung that the child had been taken by ""a Perth couple"".  Also instructive is a series of answers given by the appellant to Detective Gaut in the interview of May 2003.  The questions and answers are set out at [226]-[233] above.  The appellant attempted to assimilate the ""Perth couple"" to whom she claimed to Ms Fung to have given the child, with Andrew Morris/Norris, and his partner ""Mel"".  All members of this Court viewed the video recording of the interview.  The attempt to assimilate the ""Perth couple"" to Andrew Morris/Norris and ""Mel"" failed.  It is apparent that, in giving these answers, the appellant was desperately attempting to reconcile the various false accounts she had given.  That part of the interview is a compelling demonstration that the appellant was not telling the truth about the disposal of Tegan.
279That leaves the obvious question: if Tegan was not given to a ""Perth couple"" and was not given to Andrew Morris/Norris and ""Mel"", what happened to her?
280Of course, the mere fact that the appellant told untruths about the disposal of the child does not, of itself, establish that the appellant killed the child.  It is, however, one powerful item of evidence in a circumstantial case. 
281The evidence, in our view, convincingly excluded any reasonable possibility of the second alternative, that the child had been given to her father.  The police investigation virtually excluded any possibility that there existed a man named Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris with whom the appellant had had ""a brief affair"".  Not one person with whom the appellant had been in contact at the relevant time came forward to say that he or she had known the appellant and Andrew Morris/Norris.  The evidence strongly established that no such person had lived in the Wisbeach Street apartments that the appellant said that he had lived in.  The police investigation pursued every line of inquiry left open by the appellant - his date of birth, his occupation (in finance), his participation in water polo.  Leads given by the appellant proved false - for example, she told Detective Gaut that Lisa Andreatta could confirm the existence of Andrew Morris/Norris, and the birth of Tegan.  Not only did Ms Andreatta not confirm either of those facts, she gave evidence to the contrary.  
282Extensive searches by police failed to produce any person who might be Andrew Morris/Norris.  Equally extensive searches failed to produce any child who might be Tegan.  
283Once the reasonable possibility that the appellant might have given the child to Andrew Morris/Norris is excluded, only one inference remains reasonably open.  That is that Tegan is dead.  
(ii) Did the Crown prove that the death of Tegan was caused by an act of the appellant?
284The evidence was that the appellant left Auburn Hospital at between 11am and 12 noon on 14 September, taking Tegan with her.  She arrived at her parents' home at Fairlight at 3pm without Tegan.  She mentioned nothing to anybody about the birth of Tegan.  There was no evidence (other than her claim to have given Tegan to the natural father, a claim we have already held to be untenable in (i) above) that could found any reasonable inference that, in the interim, the appellant disposed of the child in any lawful manner.  Once it is concluded that the child is dead, it is a short step, and an inevitable one, to the further conclusion that it was the act of the appellant that caused the death.  We are satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that it was an act of the appellant that caused Tegan's death.
(iii) Was the act that caused Tegan's death done by the appellant with the intention of killing the child?
285This has been largely dealt with in consideration of ground 1 of the appeal.  
286It is to be noted that in oral argument in support of this ground, it was accepted that it is inextricably linked with ground 1 concerning the availability of an alternative count of manslaughter.
287For the reasons given in relation to ground 1, the evidence was capable of establishing that the appellant intended to kill Tegan, and was not such as to establish any other, or lesser, intention.
288The final strategy on behalf of the appellant was to characterise the police investigation as ""substandard"", as a result of which, it was contended, prejudice was occasioned to the appellant, including, but not limited to, delay in bringing the matter to trial.
289In support of that criticism of the investigation, it was put that the Crown had in fact, in opening to the jury, conceded the inadequacy of the police investigation.  That is not so.  What the Crown conceded, correctly, was that the investigation got off to a slow start.  After Mr Borovnik referred the matter to police, Detective Kehoe interviewed the appellant, but it was not until Detective Gaut assumed control that it gained pace.  Thereafter, numerous lines of inquiry were followed in meticulous detail.  While courts are not always in a position to make judgments about the quality of police investigations, in this instance, so far as it is possible to gauge, the Crown description of the subsequent investigation as ""exemplary"" is apt.
290In any event, it is difficult to see what prejudice was caused to the appellant by the nature of the investigation.  Every lead the appellant gave to Detective Gaut was followed up.  Potential witnesses in her favour, such as Lisa Andreatta, were located and questioned.  As it happens, the evidence Ms Andreatta gave did not assist the appellant at all.  But it can hardly be said that a substandard investigation caused prejudice to the appellant.  It was evidence that the investigation yielded that caused prejudice, but it was not in any way unfair prejudice.  
291In all of the circumstances, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilty was amply open to the jury, and we are satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt the appellant's guilt of the offence.
292This ground of appeal fails.

2762963,DS v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 313,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
On 17 September 2009, the appellant was found guilty of a number of offences. Relevantly, on count 3, being an offence contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(2) the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years, consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years. The appellant's appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 26 July 2012. The Court granted leave to appeal against sentence and the appeal was allowed in respect of, relevantly, count 3. The Court re-sentenced the appellant on count 3 to a non-parole period of  3 years and an additional term of 1 year.
On 6 August 2012, the Crown applied, by letter, for the reopening of the appeal against sentence on the basis that the Crown had erroneously conceded that the standard non-parole period applicable to count 3 was 5 years, when in fact, the applicable standard non-parole period was 8 years.
Held by the Court (Beazley P, Harrison and McCallum JJ):  
(1) The Court has jurisdiction to hear the Crown's application pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 50C because the Crown's letter was made within 14 days of entry of the orders and, in accordance with r 2, the form of the application is not a matter of substance: [13]. Applied: Criminal Appeal Rules, rr 2, 50C; R v Green and Quinn [2011] NSWCCA 71.
(2) The standard non-parole period for count 3 was 8 years: [26]. Having regard to the principles in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. which include reference to the standard non-parole period, in this case of 8 years, as one of two legislative guideposts, the other being the maximum penalty of 10 years, a different sentence is warranted from that imposed by way of re-sentence on 26 July 2012: [31]. Applied: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.






			Judgment
1THE COURT:  On 17 September 2009, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of two offences contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(2):  counts 1 and 3;  one offence contrary to s 61O(2):  count 2;  and an offence contrary to s 66EA(1):  count 5.  Relevantly for present purposes, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment on count 3 to a term of 8 years commencing on 20 May 2010 and to expire on 19 May 2018, consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 20 May 2010 and to expire on 19 May 2016 and a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 20 May 2016 and to expire on 19 May 2018.
2The total aggregate term to which the appellant had been sentenced was 13 years which commenced on 20 May 2009 and was to expire on 19 May 2022, consisting of an aggregate non-parole period of 9 years 9 months which commenced on 20 May 2009 and which was to expire on 19 February 2019 and an aggregate balance of term of 3 years and 3 months commencing on 20 February 2019 to expire on 19 May 2022.  
3An appeal against conviction was dismissed by this Court on 26 July 2012.  However, leave to appeal against sentence was granted and the appeal was allowed in respect of the sentences imposed for counts 3 and 5:  DS v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 159.
4On 6 August 2012, the Crown applied, by letter, for the reopening of the appeal against sentence on the basis that the Crown had made an erroneous concession on the appeal that the standard non-parole period applicable to count 3 was 5 years, when in fact, the applicable standard non-parole period was 8 years.  
5Count 3 carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  The Court re-sentenced the appellant on count 3 to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 20 May 2010 and to expire on 19 May 2013 and an additional term of 1 year to commence on 20 May 2013 and to expire on 19 May 2014.  The appellant has now served the non-parole period to which he was sentenced by this Court.  
6The appellant nonetheless remains in custody, as the non-parole period imposed in respect of count 5, which was ordered to commence on 20 May 2012, does not expire until 19 February 2019.  The appellant is also subject to an order for the balance of term in respect of count 5 of 3 years and 3 months, which will expire on 19 May 2022.  
7On the appeal, the specific error alleged in respect of the trial judge's sentencing on count 3 was that her Honour had wrongly stated the non-parole period in respect of this offence.  The appellant had submitted that the error was such as to require the Court to re-sentence him.  As we have noted, the Crown, on the appeal, conceded this error.  The concession, however, was wrongly made.  
8The Crown has now submitted to the Court that the error should be corrected so that there is not a wrong sentence on the record.  It seeks that the Court should now proceed to sentence the appellant in accordance with law.  The Crown recognised that a possible consequence of its application was that a longer sentence would be imposed in respect of count 3 than imposed by the Court on 26 July 2013.  
9The Crown does not contend that the sentence ought to be as severe as that imposed by the trial judge.  Presumably, this submission was based on this Court's view, at [137] of our original decision, that the sentencing judge had ""too prescriptively tied the non-parole period to the standard non-parole period"" contrary to the principle in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39;  244 CLR 120.  
10The Crown's application was made pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 50C and alternatively, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 43.
11Rule 50C provides:
""50C Power to set aside or vary order
(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.
(2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered.
(3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.
(4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3).
(5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.""  (emphasis added)
12The Court's orders made on 26 July 2012 were entered on 31 July 2012.  The Crown's letter of 6 August 2012 was made within 14 days of entry of the orders.  The Criminal Appeal Rules, r 2 provides:
""(1) The forms set out in the Schedule to these Rules, with such alterations as circumstances require, shall be used in all cases where such forms are applicable; but any variance therefrom not being in matter of substance, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings.""
13Given that the form in which an application is made is not a matter of substance, the letter of 6 August 2012 should be accepted as constituting an application to the Court so as to engage the Court's jurisdiction pursuant to r 50C:  see R v Green and Quinn [2011] NSWCCA 71 at [30].  We would comment, however, that the Crown should nonetheless, when seeking to engage the Court's authority to increase a sentence already passed, articulate the relief sought in an application duly filed in the Registry rather than merely writing to the Registrar.
14As the Court considers that r 50C applies, it is not necessary to consider whether the application may also be brought under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 43.
15The appellant appeared on the hearing of the application.  He accepts that his contention on the appeal, and the Crown concession, that the trial judge had applied the wrong standard non-parole period, was wrong.  Although he originally contended that the letter from the DPP was insufficient to give the Court jurisdiction under r 50C, he abandoned that position during the course of oral argument.  
16The appellant accepts that the record should be amended so as to properly reflect the law, but submitted that the Court should not now interfere with the sentence it imposed on 26 July 2012, particularly as the non-parole period had expired.  
17The Crown's concession on the appeal that the standard non-parole period was 5 years, resulted from a failure to appreciate that from 1 January 2008, the increase to the standard non-parole period applied to all offences under s 61M(2) unless the offender had already been sentenced or a plea of guilty had been accepted.  
18The correct statutory position is as follows (what appears below has been extracted from the Crown's submissions and has been reviewed and considered to be correct).
19The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 commenced on 30 April 2000.  The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 commenced on and from 1 February 2003.  
20It is relevant to note that the period pleaded in count 3 was in respect of the period 1 February 2003 and 14 September 2003.
21By s 3 and Sch 1[4] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was amended by the insertion of Pt 4, Div 1A which, inter alia, provided a Table that included (at Item 9B) a standard non-parole period of 5 years for offences contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
22By s 3, Sch 3.2[9] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was also amended by the insertion of Sch 2, Pt 7, cl 45, which provided, relevantly, that Pt 4, Div 1A (the standard non-parole provisions) does not apply to offences committed before the commencement of the amendments provided.  The effect of this provision, therefore, is that the standard non-parole period provisions do not apply to offences committed before 1 February 2003.  
23The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 commenced on and from 1 January 2008.
24By s 3 and Sch 1[10] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007, Pt 4, Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was amended by omitting ""5 years"" from Item 9B of the Table and inserting ""8 years"", viz, increasing the standard non-parole period from 5 years to 8 years for offences contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
25By s 3, Sch 1[16] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was also amended by the insertion of Sch 2, Pt 17, cl 57 which provided that the amendments made by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 apply to all such offences whenever committed unless before the commencement of that Act the sentencing court had convicted the offender or accepted from the offender a plea of guilty that had not subsequently been withdrawn.
26The appellant had not, relevantly, been convicted in the period between 1 February 2003 and 1 January 2008.  Thus, the standard non-parole period for count 3 was 8 years. 
27In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge considered the appellant's offending in respect of count 3 to be below the mid-range of objective seriousness.  On the appeal, there was no challenge by the Crown to that assessment.  The Court, at [142], whilst noting that a determination in those terms is not required by the Act:  see Muldrock, considered that her Honour's finding correctly reflected the objective seriousness of the offence.  There were no relevant mitigating factors.
28The Crown submitted that, in now re-sentencing the appellant, the Court would not be influenced by the expiry of the non-parole period as the appellant remains in custody in respect of count 5.  Rather, the Court should now impose an appropriate sentence in accordance with law. 
29The circumstances of count 3 are recounted at [11] of the Court's principal judgment.  In re-sentencing the appellant, the Court, at [142], took into account that count 3 ""exhibited a heightened and more serious degree of sexual conduct on and towards the complainant"" than was constituted in the offending conduct in grounds 1 and 2.  The Court also commented, at [143]: 
""Although this sentence is considerably lower than that imposed by the trial judge, the Court considers it properly reflects the appellant's criminality on this occasion ...""
30The question which now arises is whether the Court should impose some different sentence having regard to a standard non-parole period of 8 years and applying the principles stated in Muldrock.  In Muldrock, the Court stated, at [27]: 
""Section 54B(2) and s 54B(3) [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999] oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The latter requires that content be given to its specification as 'the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness'. Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.""
31This Court's sentencing remarks referred to at [29] above were made and the sentence was imposed, in the context of the principles in Muldrock, but having regard to a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  Having regard to the principles in Muldrock, which include reference to the standard non-parole period, in this case of 8 years, as one of two legislative guideposts, the other being the maximum penalty of 10 years, the Court has concluded that a different sentence is warranted from that imposed by way of re-sentence on 26 July 2012. 
32Accordingly, we make the following orders:
1. Vacate the sentence imposed on the appellant by this Court on 26 July 2012 in respect of count 3;
2. Re-sentence the appellant in respect of count 3 to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to commence on 20 May 2010 and to expire on 19 November 2014 and an additional term of 1 year 6 months commencing on 20 November 2014 and to expire on 19  May 2016.

2762970,Harris v Harrison [2013] NSWCCA 314,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
The applicant, Ronald Harris, after a plea of guilty, was convicted of an offence under the Water Management Act 2000, s 91K(1) in that he intentionally or recklessly interfered with or disconnected metering equipment that had been installed in connection with water supply work. The sentencing judge imposed a fine of $28,000 and, relevantly, made an order pursuant to the Water Management Act, s 353G(1)(a) that Mr Harris, within 28 days from the date of judgment, place an advertisement, in the terms specified in an annexure to the Court's judgment, in two rural newspapers stating, inter alia, that he had been found guilty of the offence and fined (the publication order). The applicant is appealing the sentence imposed by the Land and Environment Court after he entered a plea of guilty. By interlocutory application, the applicant sought a stay of the publication order by the Court of Criminal Appeal pending the appeal.  An application for a stay made to the sentencing judge, Pepper J, had been refused.
The application required the Court to consider what was the appropriate test for the grant of a stay and whether, in the circumstances, a stay should be granted.
The Court allowed the application with costs.
Held per Beazley P (McCallum J and Schmidt J agreeing):  
(1)The appropriate test for the grant of a stay of orders made by the Land and Environment Court in its criminal jurisdiction is that stated in Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685: [34], [63], [64].
(2)A stay ought to be ordered because the applicant demonstrated an arguable case on the appeal and because, if his appeal is successful, it is possible that the publication order would not be made or its content may be different so that unless a stay is ordered, a significant aspect of the appeal, which challenges the making of the publication order, will have no substantive impact: [59], [63], [64].  




			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  On 17 July 2013, the applicant, Ronald Harris, after a plea of guilty, was convicted of an offence under the Water Management Act 2000, s 91K(1) in that he intentionally or recklessly interfered with or disconnected metering equipment that had been installed in connection with the water supply work at Ravensworth Station, a large farming property near Hay, New South Wales.  
2The maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for two years or 10,000 penalty units (that is, $1,100,000), or both:  Water Management Act, s 363B.
3The sentencing judge imposed a fine of $28,000 and, in addition, made an order pursuant to the Water Management Act, s 353G(1)(a) that Mr Harris, within 28 days from the date of judgment, place an advertisement, in the terms specified in an annexure to the Court's judgment, in two rural newspapers stating, inter alia, that he had been found guilty of the offence and fined (the publication order).  Her Honour also made a costs order against Mr Harris. 
4On 14 August 2013, Mr Harris filed a notice of intention to appeal or to apply for leave to appeal against sentence.  A notice of appeal has been filed.
5By interlocutory application dated 26 August 2013, filed in this Court, Mr Harris sought a stay of the publication order.  An application for a stay made to the sentencing judge, Pepper J, was refused:  Harrison v Harris (No 3) [2013] NSWLEC 140.  
6The principal reason for seeking a stay of the advertising order is that if a stay is not granted, an appeal against the severity of the sentence will be rendered nugatory, as the advertisements would have been placed in the rural newspapers as ordered by the sentencing judge.  Mr Harris is also concerned that if he complies with the publication order prior to the hearing of the appeal, it will have an adverse effect on his reputation.  Mr Harris accepts that he bears the onus of establishing that it is appropriate for the Court to grant a stay.  
7The prosecutor opposes the application for a stay on the basis that a publication order made under the Water Management Act is not amenable to appeal, so that there is no jurisdiction in the Court to grant a stay.  The prosecutor also opposes the grant of a stay on the basis that it would be inappropriate to do so in circumstances where Mr Harris, at the sentence hearing, had consented to the publication order.  
The issues on the application
8Initially, the prosecutor had sought to argue that the Court had no jurisdiction and no power to grant a stay.  At the commencement of the hearing of the application, the Court was advised that the prosecutor accepted that the Court has an implied jurisdiction, being that which is incidental to its statutory powers, including the power to grant a stay.  
9The prosecutor submitted, however, that the publication order was not amenable to an appeal under the statutory regime for the bringing of appeals from a conviction under the Water Management Act.  If the publication order was not amenable to an appeal, there would be no basis for the implication of a power to stay that order.  It followed, on this argument, that the Court had no jurisdiction to grant a stay of the publication order.
10During the course of the argument, it became apparent that there was a difficulty with this aspect of the prosecutor's argument as, if pressed, it would involve the Court making a determination on that question.  The prosecutor did not wish to have that matter determined in a way that might give rise to an issue estoppel or otherwise preclude that question being agitated on the appeal.  The question whether an issue estoppel would arise on the hearing of an application such as this was not expanded upon in argument by either party.  However, the prosecutor's position was that he did not want to be subject to that risk and accordingly did not seek to have the Court determine its contention that the publication order was not amenable to appeal.  The prosecutor recognised that if the publication order was not amenable to appeal, Mr Harris could seek relief by way of judicial review.
11The prosecutor had also taken the stance, as I have already indicated, that a stay should not be granted in this case in circumstances where Mr Harris had agreed to the publication order or, at least, as to its terms.  However, during the course of argument on the application, Senior Counsel for the prosecutor accepted that there had been no such agreement.  Rather, after the sentencing judge had indicated that a publication order was to be made, there had been some negotiation as to the terms of the publication.  In my opinion, this did not amount to a concession by Mr Harris that a publication order was appropriate.  Senior Counsel for the prosecution accepted this.
12The question, therefore, which was finally in issue on the application for a stay was whether this was an appropriate case for a stay to be granted pending the appeal.  This raised the following matters for determination:
(1) What was the appropriate test for the grant of a stay;  and
(2) Whether, in the circumstances, a stay should be granted.
13Although the issue as to whether the publication order is amenable to an appeal was not contested on the application, it nonetheless remained in the background as an issue.  Clearly, if the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the publication order, there would be no jurisdiction to order a stay of that order, unless there was some other basis for doing so.  Thus, even though the jurisdictional question was not the subject of full argument, there was discussion as to whether, even if the publication order was not amenable to an appeal, a stay ought to be granted as necessary to support the integrity of the appeal.  
14For myself, I am not satisfied that the prosecutor's contention is inarguably correct.  An examination of the legislation, which is set out below, reveals that the definition of ""Sentence"" means, inter alia, any order made by the court of trial on convicting a person of an offence.  Thus, the only power in the court to make the publication order was upon and as a consequence of conviction.  The mere fact that in the explanatory memorandum to the Water Management Act the power to make a publication order is referred to as an ""additional order"", would not be sufficient to deprive the order of the character of a sentence, or part thereof. 
Statutory scheme
(a) The Water Management Act 2000
15Part 3A of the Act prescribes the orders that may be made in connection with offences where there has been a conviction for an offence under the Act.  Section 353A provides that orders may be made under Pt 3A in addition to any penalty that may be imposed or any other action that may be taken in relation to the offence.  Those orders include, relevantly for present purposes, the making of a publication order pursuant to s 353G.  Section 353G(4) provides that the prosecutor or a person authorised by the prosecutor may publish the words ordered by the sentencing judge if a defendant fails to comply with that order.
(b) The Land and Environment Court Act 1979
16Section 56(b) of the Act provides:
""56 Nature of decision of the Court
Except as provided:
...
(b) by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in relation to proceedings in Class 5, 6 or 7 of the Court's jurisdiction,
a decision of the Court shall be final and conclusive.
17The proceedings brought against Mr Harris were brought in class 5 of the Court's jurisdiction.
(c) The Criminal Appeal Act 1912
18Section 5AB of the Act provides:
""5AB Appeal in criminal cases dealt with by Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction
Section 5AA applies to and in respect of a person:
(a) convicted of an offence, or
(b) against whom an order to pay costs is made, or whose application for an order for costs is dismissed, or
(c) in whose favour an order for costs is made,
by the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction in the same way as it applies to a person referred to in section 5AA (1), and, for the purposes of this section, a reference in section 5AA to the Supreme Court shall be read and construed as a reference to the Land and Environment Court.""
19Section 5AA provides, relevantly:
""5AA Appeal in criminal cases dealt with by Supreme Court or District Court in their summary jurisdiction
(1) A person:
(a) convicted of an offence ...
...
by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction may appeal under this Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction (including any sentence imposed) or order.
...
(4) The Court of Criminal Appeal, in proceedings before it on an appeal under this section, may confirm the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction or may order that the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction be vacated and make any determination that the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction could have made on the evidence heard on appeal.
...""  (emphasis added)
20""Sentence"" is defined, relevantly, in s 2 as follows:
""(a) any order made by the court of trial on convicting a person of an offence, including:
(i) any sentence of imprisonment (including any sentence of imprisonment the subject of an intensive correction order or home detention order and any sentence of imprisonment whose execution is suspended), and
(ii) any community service order, and
(iii) any good behaviour bond, and
(iv) any fine,
imposed under Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ...""
21""Sentence"" is defined in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 3 to mean, relevantly, the penalty imposed for an offence.  
(d) The Interpretation Act 1987
22Section 21 of the Act provides that ""penalty"" includes forfeiture and punishment.
Principles governing the grant of a stay
23Mr Harris submitted that the principles applicable to the grant of a stay in a criminal appeal before a court exercising summary jurisdiction are generally those that apply in non-criminal matters:  Porteous & Others v Inspector McMartin [2005] NSWIRComm 122 at [13].  
24In accordance with those principles, the onus of persuading the court to grant a stay is on the party seeking the stay:  Waller v Todorovic (Court of Appeal, 21 December 1979, unreported);  Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 at 694.  An applicant for a stay of execution of the orders of a trial court, pending an appeal to an intermediate appellate court, is required to establish a proper basis for a stay that will be fair to all parties:  Trlin v Marac Finance Australia Ltd (Court of Appeal, 4 March 1985, unreported);  Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp at 694.  It is not necessary to establish ""special"" or ""exceptional"" circumstances:  Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp at 693-694.  
25A discretionary consideration that would tend to the grant of a stay is where there is a risk that an appeal will prove abortive if a party succeeds on the appeal if the stay is not granted:  Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 695.  Likewise, if there is a real risk that the appellant will suffer prejudice or damage if the stay is not granted, which cannot be addressed by a successful appeal, a stay may be warranted:  O'Brien v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2009] NSWCA 312;  74 ACSR 324 at [25].
26The Court, in determining whether to grant a stay, will make a preliminary assessment as to whether the applicant has an arguable case on appeal:  Alexander v Cambridge Credit at 695.
27The prosecutor submitted that the appropriate test to be applied was by analogy with the Bail Act in respect of which, at common law, special or exceptional circumstances must be demonstrated before bail will be granted.  In advancing this submission, the prosecutor recognised that the analogy was not perfect.  
28I am not persuaded that the Bail Act provides an appropriate analogy.  Had Mr Harris been ordered to serve a sentence of imprisonment, he would have been subject to the provisions of the Bail Act in force at the time of his application.  The question presently in issue raises very different considerations from those that fall to be determined when the court is granting bail.
29The prosecutor also relied upon the decision of Owen J in Stampalia v The Stewards of The Western Australian Trotting and Association & Anor [1999] WASC 7, where his Honour was concerned with an application for a stay of a penalty pending resolution of an application for a prerogative writ.  His Honour had not been able to find any authority as to the principles to be applied and thus turned to the principles that applied in bail cases and in respect of applications for stay pending the determination of a special leave application to the High Court.  His Honour adopted the principles emerging from those cases.  Whilst not endorsing a requirement of ""exceptional circumstances"", his Honour, at [11], considered that the appropriate test was whether there were: 
""... special circumstances sufficient to satisfy the court that it is just and reasonable to order a stay so as to preserve the subject-matter and integrity of the litigation?"" 
30I have already explained why I do not consider that the appropriate analogy is with the principles that apply to the grant of bail.  I am also not satisfied that the appropriate principles are those that apply to stays sought pending the grant of special leave to the High Court.  The jurisdiction of the High Court in granting special leave requires the Court to be satisfied, inter alia, that where a question of law is involved, there is a question of public importance.  In other cases, the court is required to consider whether the administration of justice requires the High Court's consideration of the judgment sought to be appealed from:  see the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 35A.  
31The prosecutor said, alternatively, that the applicable principles were those determined by the sentencing judge on the hearing of a stay application before her:  Harrison v Harris (No 3).  Her Honour, after rejecting that the principles applicable to the grant of bail or for a stay pending the determination of application for special leave were appropriate, considered, at [23], that the applicable principles were those stated in Alexander v Cambridge Credit and summarised them at [24].  
32For the reasons I have given, I consider that the appropriate test is not one that has any analogy to the principles applicable to bail applications at common law, or to stays pending the determination of an application for special leave to appeal.  The present case engaged the exercise of the Land and Environment Court's summary criminal jurisdiction.  The Court's powers on sentence include the serious punishment of imprisonment.  If a person was sentenced to imprisonment, a bail application could be made pending an appeal.  There are also other orders that may be made, including fines and publication orders, as was made in this case.  A person may wish to have such orders stayed pending an appeal.  
33The principles in Alexander v Cambridge Credit have the attraction of stating a principle in flexible terms that can be applied having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.  Pursuant to those principles, an applicant for a stay is required to demonstrate that there is a proper basis for a stay that is fair to all parties.  I consider that is the appropriate test to apply in determining whether to stay orders (other than a sentence of imprisonment) made by the Land and Environment Court in its criminal jurisdiction. 
Should a stay be granted?
(a) arguable case on the appeal
34Mr Harris' notice of appeal contained 16 grounds, raising, in summary, the following issues:  the construction of relevant provisions of the Act and the proper application of those provisions to the facts;  challenges to her Honour's sentencing methodology;  challenges to her Honour's fact finding, including that there was actual environmental harm caused by the commission of the offence;  and a contention that her Honour failed to sentence in accordance with the charge in that her Honour wrongly treated the offence as one of taking water rather than the offence of tampering with a water meter.  There is then a catchall ground of appeal that the fine, the publication order and the costs order, taken together, were manifestly excessive having regard to the proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and the matters raised in mitigation.  
35I do not propose to deal with all the grounds of appeal.  Rather, it is sufficient to focus on the questions of statutory construction raised in the first ground of appeal and with the issue raised in grounds 2 and 3, and ground 12.  
36In ground 1 of his notice of appeal, Mr Harris challenged the sentencing judge's construction, at [97], of the Water Management Act, s 52.  He contended that this error of construction had implications for her Honour's finding as to the objective severity of the offence and to the manner in which her Honour dealt with his case in mitigation.  He submitted that if he was successful on this ground of appeal, he has a strong ground for contending that the sentencing discretion miscarried. 
37Section 52 of the Water Management Act provides, relevantly:
""52 Domestic and stock rights
(1) ... an owner or occupier of a landholding is entitled, without the need for an access licence, water supply work approval or water use approval:
(a) to take water from any river, estuary or lake to which the land has frontage ... and
(b) to construct and use a water supply work for that purpose, and
(c) to use the water so taken for domestic consumption and stock watering, but not for any other purpose.
...
(3) In this section:domestic consumption, in relation to land, means consumption for normal household purposes in domestic premises situated on the land.
stock watering, in relation to land, means the watering of stock animals being raised on the land, but does not include the use of water in connection with the raising of stock animals on an intensive commercial basis that are housed or kept in feedlots or buildings for all (or a substantial part) of the period during which the stock animals are being raised.""
38The sentencing judge, at [97], stated:
""... in my opinion, acting lawfully pursuant to an exercise of rights under s 52 could only authorise the extraction of sufficient water to fill the House Dam. Otherwise the provision would give those water users with a domestic dam some distance from the water source a considerable advantage over those whose dams were closer in proximity to the extraction source. I do not believe that this was the objective intention of the legislature in enacting s 52 of the [Water Management Act].""
39Mr Harris submitted that the trial judge's error was in rejecting his contention that his rights under s 52 included the placement of water in an irrigation channel for the purposes of conveying the water to the point where it could be used, when express words of the section included that right.  It would seem that this submission was based upon the terms of s 52(1)(b) and the definition of ""water supply work"" in the Dictionary of the Act. 
40The prosecutor submitted that this ground raised a mixed question of fact and law.  He contended that in order for this aspect of Mr Harris' case on mitigation to succeed it was necessary for him to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he had used the water taken for domestic consumption but not for any other purpose.  On the prosecutor's argument, there was a difficulty with this aspect of Mr Harris' case as he had made admissions both in a record of interview and under cross-examination that part of the un-metered water that he had taken was to be used for the purpose of irrigation.  In other words, it had not been taken for domestic consumption.
41Mr Harris denied he made admissions as the prosecutor contended.  
42In my opinion, it is likely that this issue does raise a mixed question of fact and law.  In the absence of having been taken to the evidence, it is not possible for the Court to make any assessment of the strength of Mr Harris' argument.  The most that can be said is that it has been advanced by Senior Counsel for Mr Harris, and in accordance with his obligations to the Court, can only have been advanced responsibly and on the basis that it is arguable.  On the other hand, it has been refuted by equally responsible Senior Counsel for the prosecutor, although the refutation is an argument that the ground will not succeed.  It was not expressly put that the ground was not arguable.  That is relevant, but, having regard to my conclusion in respect of grounds 2, 3 and 12, I do not need to finally decide whether it would be sufficient to satisfy the first limb of the test stated in Alexander v Cambridge Credit.
43Grounds 2 and 3 were directed to the relevance, as a mitigating factor, of the absence of any regulatory requirement for a meter on the part of the water source from which the water was taken.  Mr Harris submitted that this had been conceded by the prosecutor.  Mr Harris' complaint was that the sentencing judge failed to decide this matter and consequently had failed to take it into account at all.  He contended that it was a significant omission.  
44In response, the prosecutor submitted that this submission failed to fully draw to the Court's attention what was otherwise in the amended statement of agreed facts and in other parts of the prosecutor's submissions.  The prosecutor pointed out that this was an example of why Mr Harris' application for a stay was misconceived, as the Court is not expected to hear a rehearsal of the appeal.
45In my opinion, the respective arguments of the parties on these grounds of appeal also make it apparent that there are issues raised on the appeal, which on their face, are arguable.  The prosecutor's response that an application for a stay is not a rehearsal for the appeal is correct.  I would only comment that a blocking response of that nature does not assist the Court in determining whether there is an arguable case.  Something more would need to be demonstrated in opposition to an otherwise apparently arguable case if the Court was to be persuaded to come to a different conclusion.
46In ground 12, Mr Harris contended that her Honour erred in finding that damage to the regulatory system was actual environmental harm.  This ground challenges her Honour's interpretation of the Water Management Act, s 364A(1)(c).  Section 364A requires the Court to take certain matters into account when imposing a sentence for an offence under the Act.  Those factors include subs (1)(c), which provides:
""(c) the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment (including, in particular, any water source or waterfront land) by the commission of the offence.""
47The amount of unmetered water, between 30-40 ML was, having regard to the water resource, miniscule.  Mr Harris argued, therefore, that the effect on the river and the catchment and, therefore, on the environment, was all but negligible.  Her Honour stated, at [108], that this argument was superficially compelling, accepting, as I understand her reasons, that there was a ""barely registrable amount of water"" extracted during the approximate 17 hours over which the offending conduct occurred.  However, her Honour applied the approach taken in Harrison v Baring (No 2) [2012] NSWLEC 145, where Pain J stated, at [44]:
""The systems of ordering water and measuring water taken are important as they allow the New South Wales Office of Water to monitor and control the taking of water, manage the flow of the river, lesson negative impacts on the environment, and ensure the lawful and equitable sharing of water.""
48I have set out the terms of s 364(1)(c) at [46].  In my opinion, Mr Harris' contention that a finding of damage to the regulatory system was actual environmental harm within the meaning of that provision is clearly arguable.  In coming to that conclusion, I have not overlooked the fact that the Court may take into consideration other matters that it considers relevant:  s 364(2).  However, that is not the approach her Honour took to the section.  Whether, on appeal, if this ground is made out, it will make any difference to the sentence imposed, is not something that was argued and it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment. 
49Although I have not considered whether there is an arguable case in respect of each ground of appeal, I am satisfied that the appeal itself is arguable such as to satisfy this aspect of the principles governing the grant of a stay.
(b) discretionary considerations
50Mr Harris' principal submission was that the errors made by the sentencing judge were such that the penalty was manifestly excessive.  If any of his arguments succeeded, the Court may impose a different penalty and make different orders, including that there be no publication order, or that the terms of any publication be different from those ordered by the sentencing judge.  
51If some different order is made, the appeal will have been rendered nugatory if the notice has already been published in accordance with the publication order.
52Mr Harris also submitted that if some other order is made on the appeal, his reputation will already have been irreversibly damaged by the publication of the notice in its present terms.  In response to the prosecutor's argument, which is set out below, at [56], that the terms of the court order are already in the public domain, Mr Harris argued that a publication pursuant to a court order carries with it a particular weight that would not necessarily be accorded to a report in the newspaper.  Accordingly, the fact that there was already some information in the public domain was not an answer to his concern.  
53The prosecutor contended that the terms of the publication ordered were such that they would publicise the offence ""in the most objectively neutral terms"".  The prosecutor also contended that the publication order made in this case was consistent with the approach taken by the Land and Environment Court in applying such powers in other Acts, noting that the publication order was ordered as an additional option to the imposition of a penalty.  In this regard, the prosecutor emphasised that a publication order served the purpose of general deterrence and was not in itself part of a sentence or the imposition of punishment, even if punishment was a secondary purpose.  In support of this argument, the prosecutor relied upon the Explanatory Notes, which noted that s 353G was ""a provision that enables a court to make certain additional orders against the offender"" (emphasis added).
54The prosecutor also refuted Mr Harris' contention that the publication order would have an adverse effect on his reputation.  He submitted that Mr Harris' submission ignored the fact that he had pleaded guilty to the offence, so that regardless of the outcome of the sentencing appeal, the criminal conviction would remain, with any consequent damage to reputation that that might involve.  In any event, the published reasons of the trial judge and media reports of the judgment, were already in the public domain.  
55The prosecutor also informed the Court that the media reports, which had been based upon a media release issued by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, were inaccurate, in that they asserted that the offence was committed at a time of severe water shortage and, at least, imputed that Mr Harris had tampered with the meter for the purpose of stealing water.  Both these matters were wrong.  The gravamen of this submission was that even though the media reporting had been inaccurate, Mr Harris' reputation had already suffered damage so that the ""neutrally objective"" publication ordered by the Court would not cause further damage.  On this approach, it could not be said, therefore, that the publication of the notice ordered by the Court would render nugatory the subject matter of the appeal.
56The prosecutor relied upon the observations of the Court of Appeal in O'Brien v Australian Securities and Investments Commission as to the utility of a stay when damage to the appellant's reputation had already been caused by the publication of the primary judgment.  In that case, the Court noted that if the appellant's reputation was to be reinstated, it would only be by being successful on the appeal.  That case, however, involved an appeal against liability as well as against sentence.  In this case, as already indicated, the prosecutor relied upon the fact that Mr Harris had pleaded guilty and there was no conviction appeal.  
57The prosecutor also submitted that the words Mr Harris had sought to be added to the publication order would not have reflected the sentencing judge's findings.  The prosecutor submitted that her Honour's rejection of Mr Harris' attempt to have these words included was appropriate, having regard to her findings.
Resolution
58In my opinion, Mr Harris has made out a case for a stay.  I consider he has demonstrated that he has an arguable case on the appeal.  If he is successful, it is possible that the publication order would not be made, or its content may be different, so that unless a stay is ordered, a significant aspect of the appeal, which challenges the making of the publication order, will have no substantive impact if the publication has already occurred.  
59This last observation presumes that the publication order is amenable to an appeal.  As I have indicated, the prosecutor proposes to put that matter in issue at a jurisdictional level on the hearing of the appeal.  However, for the reasons I have expressed above, it is arguable that the publication order forms part of the sentence imposed.  The fact that the matter is likely to be in issue on the appeal is not sufficient to deprive this Court of jurisdiction to grant a stay in those circumstances. 
60The prosecutor submitted that as an alternative to a stay, the Court could order that the publication be made, but be subject to a rider that the matter was under appeal.  I am not satisfied that this is an answer to the application.  The status of any such publication is itself debatable.  Would it constitute compliance with the sentencing judge's order?  If not, would Mr Harris be faced with the necessity to comply with the order, effectively for a second time, if he is not successful in having some different order made on the appeal?  But in any event, I do not consider this is an appropriate response to the application.  First, if publication with the rider added was compliant with the sentencing judge's order, there would be little purpose in seeking a different order on the appeal.  More importantly, however, I consider that Mr Harris has made out a case for a stay and there is no reason why any lesser or qualified order should be made.  
61Mr Harris seeks costs.  As he has been successful on his application, there is no reason why a costs order ought not be made in his favour.  Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
(1) Order 6 made by Pepper J on 17 July 2013 be stayed pending the determination of the appeal;
(2) Order the respondent to pay the applicant's costs of the application.
62McCALLUM J:  I agree with Beazley P.
63SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Beazley P.
