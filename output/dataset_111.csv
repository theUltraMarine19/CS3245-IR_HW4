Introduction 

The appellant was indicted on a charge that 

""On 15 November 2007 at Blackett in the State of New South Wales [he] did break and enter a shop, namely the BRV Bakery, situated at 2/38 Boulderwood Road and did commit a serious indictable offence therein namely, did steal a cash register containing a quantity of cash, in circumstances of aggravation namely, being in company with two other unknown persons."" contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

The maximum penalty for such an offence is 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of five years is applicable. 

4A jury found the appellant guilty of the offence charged. He was convicted and, on 27 November 2009, sentenced to a non-parole period of five years imprisonment, commencing on 3 December 2008 and expiring on 2 December 2013, with a balance of term of one year eight months imprisonment commencing on 3 December 2013 and expiring on 2 August 2015. 

5The appellant has appealed against conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds: 

""Conviction 

1. The trial Judge erred in the assessment of unfair prejudice in relation to questions 145-156 of the Police interview and should have excluded this evidence pursuant to section 137 Evidence Act, 1995. 

2. The trial Judge erred in the assessment of unfair prejudice in relation to the totality of the evidence relating to questions 145-155 of the Police interview and the relevant portions of the evidence of Police Officers Forsyth and Caulfield in determining whether the Jury should have been discharged and should have discharged the Jury. 

Sentence 

3. The sentencing Judge erred in not taking into account the principles of totality of sentencing in determining the length of the non-parole period. 

4. The sentencing Judge erred in not taking into account the effect of institutionalisation upon the Appellant in determining the length of the non-parole period. 

5. The sentencing Judge erred in not taking into account that the Appellant was serving the sentence on Protection in determining the length of the non parole period."" 

The conviction appeal - background 

6At approximately 3.50 am on 15 November 2007 three hooded men broke and entered the bakery and stole the cash register and its contents. They gained entry through a Colorbond fence which separated the rear yards of the bakery and an adjoining butcher shop. They were observed by the co-owner, who called the police. There were a number of aggravating factors present, namely the offenders had a knife and a metal pole, damage to property was occasioned and the co-owner was vulnerable as he was working alone on the premises. The police attended at the scene after the offenders had departed. They found finger and palm prints on the dividing fence. A panel of the fence had been kicked out in the vicinity of the finger and palm prints. The finger and palm prints matched those of the appellant. The appellant was arrested and charged with the subject offence on 7 December 2007. 

7Following his arrest the appellant participated in an electronically recorded interview. The typescript of the record of interview contained the following questions and answers: 

""Q145 All right. I'll just explain to you Walter that police fingerprint experts have found fingerprint impressions on the Colorbond fence, the internal Colorbond fence located between the, at the rear of the shop. 
A. Yeah. 

Q146 So when I say internal Colorbond fence, for instance, like the backyard of the premises - 
A. Yeah. 

Q147 - has a fence that leads onto the back car park. 
A. Oh, yeah. 

Q148 I'm not talking about that fence. What I'm talking about is the fence that leads, that basically separates the bakery, from the bakery backyard from the butcher's backyard. 
A. Oh, right. 

Q149 Do you understand what I'm getting at there? 
A. Yeah. 

Q150 So we're not talking about a fence on the perimeter of the property. 
A. Yeah. 

Q151 We're talking about a fence that's actually inside, OK. And I'll just explain to you that prints have been located, bear with me, prints have been located, there's been a right palm print on the Colorbond fence. 
A. Yeah. 

Q152 A left thumb on the Colorbond fence. A left palm on the Colorbond fence, and another left palm on the Colorbond fence. And you understand that, so that's these - 
A. Yeah. 

Q153 - impressions have been found on that fence. 
A. Yeah. 

Q154 OK. I believe those impressions match your fingerprints. So do you understand that? 
A. Yeah. 

Q155 Can you explain to me how your fingerprint impressions which I believe match your fingerprints, came to be on that fence? 
A. Not really. 

Q156 All right. So do you wish to talk any more in relation to those fingerprints? 
A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)"" 

8Fresh finger and palm prints were taken from the appellant following his arrest. These were identified as being the same as the finger and palm prints on the fence. 

9The hearing commenced on 4 August 2008. The Crown, in opening its case, referred to part of the interview dealing with fingerprints. Counsel for the appellant, at the end of the Crown's opening and in the absence of the jury, raised a concern that that evidence ""leaves open that possibility that the police already had prints before he was arrested."" 

10The Crown responded: 

""The difficulty is your Honour, it's implicit in the record of interview that the police had the prints before the arrest. Because they say to him 'We've got your fingerprints on the fence, how do you explain that?' and he gives his response of 'Not really'. That's on 7 December which is the day of the arrest."" 

11Shortly after this discussion appellant's counsel, in reliance upon s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 , objected to questions and answers 145-156 of the record of interview. He submitted 

""Quite clearly what those questions imply was that there was a fingerprint examination done before the accused was arrested and if that, those questions and answers are to go before the jury, the jury will receive notification that the police had the accused's fingerprints before he was arrested and that leads to the implication that he had been in trouble with the police before. 

So my submission is your Honour because of the prejudice, the unfair prejudice that is associated with that because it discloses a prior criminal history of the accused that those questions and answers should be deleted or your Honour should not allow that evidence ... In my submission this is a case where that exclusion must operate. There will clearly be unfair prejudice to the accused because the jury will know that he has been in trouble with the police before because they have access to his fingerprints."" 

The tender was pressed by the Crown. It contended 

""...that the accused cannot explain the presence of his fingerprints as at that time and the Crown says that that has a fairly significant probative value given the location of the fingerprints. 

The Crown submits that because of that probativeness of the response the evidence should be allowed to go to the jury. The Crown says there may well be potential inference of other activity because of the existence of the fingerprints in some form or other to the police but certainly I am not intending to rely upon it or do anything to draw attention to it. But the responsive question 155 is a very important response. If that response had not been given or the witness had simply - the accused had simply said I don't want to say anything then we wouldn't be having this discussion but it's that response that is very central to the prosecution case."" 

Appellant's counsel conceded the answer to question 155 was probative of the Crown case. 

12Her Honour ruled: 

""I decline to excise the evidence. These questions are fundamental to the Crown case. I don't think that the jury will misuse the questions as suggested by defence counsel, in the circumstances the questions are to my view in a benign form and if any question is raised by the jury it can appropriately be dealt with by a direction by me to that effect. Those questions and answers will remain."" 

13On 5 August 2008 counsel for the appellant sought the deletion of question and answer 154 and that part of question 155 which read ""which I believe match your fingerprints"". These deletions were made with the consent of the Crown. 

14On 5 August 2008 Detective Forsyth, a fingerprint expert attached to the Forensic Services Group of the NSW Police Force, inter alia, was asked, in chief, to give a brief outline of the exercise of comparing prints. In doing so he said, without objection, 

""Once we're performed that analysis we then compare that unknown friction ridge skin to a known or a list of people."" 

15On 5 August 2008 Detective Caulfield, the officer in charge of the investigation, in answer to a question in cross-examination, said that he became involved in the matter as: 

""all those cases that get a bit long in the tooth or there's hits on fingerprints or whatever will generally come to me and I will take up the ball so to speak."" 

16On 6 August an application was made by the appellant for discharge of the jury. Unfortunately, due to a technical problem, the application and her Honour's ruling were not recorded or transcribed. The contemporaneous notes of the instructing solicitors for each party are before the Court. These indicate that the application was made on the basis that the evidence of Detectives Forsyth and Caulfield, referred to above, would cause a miscarriage of justice in that the jury would be made aware the appellant had a prior criminal history and that that evidence would add to the significance of the questions in the record of interview. The solicitor for the Crown's notes state her Honour was ""not persuaded that the inference argued for [presumably that the appellant had a prior criminal history] can be drawn - declined to discharge"". The appellant's solicitor's notes state, as to her Honour's ruling, ""she was not persuaded. Declined to discharge jury"". 

17The appellant then gave evidence. His explanation for the presence of his finger and palm prints on the Colorbond fence was that he lived within five minutes of the shops; he would on Friday and Saturday nights kick a football around with friends in a park in the vicinity of the shops; on occasions the ball would go into the backyard of the bakery and he would jump the fence to retrieve it; he said he was sure he did this on the Friday or Saturday immediately prior to the break-in. He also said that on occasions he would jump over the fence to hide from neighbours who would chase him. He said that he had given the answer to question 155 in the record of interview because he was shocked by the accusation made against him. 

18The only other witness for the defence was a fingerprint expert, Mr Faye. He gave evidence inter alia as to a previous investigation in respect of which he said: 

""I had to do forty eliminations of people that came to the victim's home. And it was already four days before they found the body. So I thought the son was a suspect."" 

19On 6 August, after both parties addressed the jury, there was discussion between the trial judge and the parties in relation to proposed directions to the jury. Her Honour offered to give directions to the jury in relation to the fingerprint evidence but counsel for the appellant declined the offer. 

Conviction appeal - Ground 1 - ""The trial Judge erred in the assessment of unfair prejudice in relation to questions 145-156 of the Police interview and should have excluded this evidence pursuant to section 137 Evidence Act, 1995."" 

20Section 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 states: 

""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant."" 

21The onus of establishing that the evidence should be excluded is upon the defendant - Gilmour v EPA; Tableland Topdressing v EPA [2002] NSWCCA 399, (2002) 55 NSWLR 593 at [46]. 

22In this case the evidence sought to be tendered went to the presence of the applicant's fingerprints at the scene and his failure to provide an explanation for their presence. As the Crown was otherwise unable to establish the appellant was at the crime scene this evidence was of high probative value or, as her Honour put it, the questions and answers were fundamental to the Crown case. 

23The danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant was identified as the danger that the jury would be made aware that the appellant had a prior criminal record because his fingerprints were being held by the police before his arrest on 7 December 2007. 

24The form of the questions were, as her Honour observed, benign. They did not, in terms, refer to any prior criminal record nor the existence of fingerprints obtained prior to arrest. 

25There was a possibility that the jury may infer the police had the appellant's fingerprints prior to his arrest. However, as appellant's counsel conceded, there are various ways in which the police can obtain fingerprints other than pursuant to a criminal conviction. The evidence of Mr Faye provided an example of such. Thus, if the police had fingerprints of the appellant prior to his arrest, it was only a possibility that this was as a result of a criminal conviction. Even if the jury did so infer, it would tell the jury nothing as to the nature of the offence for which he was convicted or when it occurred. It would require speculation by the jury for the danger of unfair prejudice to materialise. Such speculation would be contrary to her Honour's general direction that the jury should not draw any inference from the direct evidence unless it was the only rational inference to draw, and that suspicion must play no part in their function as judges of the facts. 

26There was no reason to conclude that the jury would engage in such reasoning or that the alleged danger was other than a remote possibility. 

27Even if the evidence was likely to be unfairly prejudicial, it does not follow that the weighing exercise will require its exclusion. As Mason P observed in R v Lumsden [2003] NSWCCA 83 at [4]: 

""I cannot accept the proposition that evidence of an accused person's involvement in criminal activity other than that charged is highly prejudicial and inadmissible on that account...""[as distinct from evidence as to the criminal conviction of an accused person in relation to a discrete offence.] 

28In my opinion it was well open to her Honour in performing the comparative weighing or balancing exercise required by s 137 to conclude that the probative value of the evidence sought to be admitted was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails. 

Conviction appeal - Ground 2 - ""The trial Judge erred in the assessment of unfair prejudice in relation to the totality of the evidence relating to questions 145-155 of the Police interview and the relevant portions of the evidence of Police Officers Forsyth and Caulfield in determining whether the Jury should have been discharged and should have discharged the Jury."" 

29The evidence of Detectives Forsyth and Caulfield, it was submitted, gave rise to the inference that the police had fingerprints of the appellant prior to his arrest and this, coupled with questions and answers 145-155 in the record of interview, created such prejudice to the appellant that the jury should be discharged. The considerations which related to the admission of questions 145-156 in respect of the record of interview are equally apposite here. 

General 

30In my opinion, no error has been demonstrated on the part of her Honour nor has any miscarriage of justice resulted from the admission of questions 145-156 of the record of interview or the refusal to discharge the jury. Accordingly, in my opinion, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 

Leave to appeal against sentence: Grounds 1, 2 and 3 - ""The sentencing Judge erred in not taking into account (a) the principles of totality of sentencing in determining the length of the non parole period; (b) the effect of institutionalisation upon the Appellant in determining the length of the non-parole period; (c) that the Appellant was serving the sentence on Protection in determining the length of the non parole period."" 

Background 

31The appellant was born in 1981. He had a difficult early life. He completed year 12 at high school. He has drug and alcohol problems. His criminal record comprises convictions for goods in custody, driving offences, custody of an offensive implement in a public place, possessing housebreaking implements, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company as well as nine convictions for break enter and steal and a conviction for aggravated break and enter. He has incurred institutional misconduct charges. The subject offence occurred whilst he was on parole. 

32Her Honour stated in her remarks on sentence: 

""He has of course been afforded considerable opportunity and support in the past. Any leniency extended to him in the past has been ignored and he has breached orders of the court put in place to assist him. In August 2000 he was ordered to perform 300 hours of community service work and was placed on a two year good behaviour bond. His responses were poor, he failed to complete the community service order and was sentenced to periodic detention. He failed to respond and attend alcohol and other drug programmes in accordance with the conditions of his good behaviour bond. He continued to re-offend. He failed to comply with an order for periodic detention and that was revoked and he was sentenced to full time custody. He re-offended whilst on that parole. He was again incarcerated and on the next occasion released to unsupervised parole and he reoffended. In June 2004 he was referred to the Parramatta Drug Court program. By his own admission, he had no intention of complying with the requirements of the program and he left the residential rehabilitation facility on the first night. Upon his release in August 2007 [he], by his own admission, was abusing alcohol and heavily to prevent from relapsing into drug use. He was also using crystal methamphetamine."" 

Totality 

33The appellant was arrested in relation to the subject offence on 7 December 2007 and was refused bail on that date. Since that date he has served the following: 

(a) 7 December 2007 - 2 March 2008 (2 months 25 days) - being the balance of parole in relation to a sentence that was imposed in 2006; 

(b) 3 March 2008 - 2 December 2008 (9 months) - being the non parole period that was imposed by the Local Court on 8 August 2008 in relation to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. This occurred after his release on 12 August 2007 and before he was arrested on 7 December 2007; 

(c) 3 December 2008 to the present - being the period referable to the subject offence. 

34The appellant sought a reduction of the non parole period by reason of the totality principle. 

35Her Honour was aware of the sentence that the appellant was serving at the date of his sentence and of the revocation of his parole. The earlier sentences were for completely unrelated offences committed against different victims in 2005 and 2007. As I have said this offence was committed whilst on parole. These were matters her Honour considered before setting the appropriate term. There was no reason in principle which mandated that the sentence be served wholly or partly concurrently with the earlier sentences. In R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381, (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 it was held: 

""...it is necessary for the judge to ensure that the aggregation of all of the sentences is a 'just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved': Postiglione v R (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307-308 per McHugh J."" 

Institutionalisation 

36Since 1 November 2001 the appellant has been in custody continuously except for the following periods: 30 April 2002 - 24 July 2005 (2 months 24 days), 23 July 2003 - 13 December 2004 (16 months 20 days), 12 August 2007 - 7 December 2007 (3 months 25 days). This will mean that by the expiration of the subject non parole period, the appellant will have served more than 10 years in custody in a time span of 12 years. 

37The appellant gave the following evidence: 

""Q. Do you feel you are becoming institutionalised because of the period of time that you have been in custody? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What effect is that having on you? 
A. Like lately, just little things are starting to anger me. Like, I've never - like not many things really have to get to me, but lately, just little things are angering me and that's why I asked to do anger management and before I get out of control there, like."" 

38The psychologist, K. Seidler, who was qualified on behalf of the appellant, in her report dated 14 October 2009 said: 

""... The issue of institutionalisation is a growing concern in this case... 

Despite obvious concerns about institutionalisation, Mr Kuehne claimed that he is comfortable and can cope in the community."" 

39This evidence does not establish the plaintiff has become institutionalised or that the sentence must be reduced to accommodate the future possibility that such may occur. 

Protection 

40At the time of sentence the appellant was on remand protection at his own request for reasons unrelated to the subject offence. He gave evidence that because he had been on remand protection he had not had access to various services that he would have had had he been serving the time and not on protection. He also said he anticipated that during the balance of his sentence he would remain on protection and his understanding was that his access to services and programmes would be restricted because of that. 

41Appellant's counsel conceded at the sentencing hearing that the effect of protection may not be as significant as it had been to date, because the appellant would no longer be a remand prisoner and would be classified. He submitted because of the very fact that he was on protection and will continue on protection for the balance of his sentence, there will be some limitation on services that will be available to him. Her Honour accepted that the appellant was currently in protective custody ""which of course will necessarily limit his access to therapeutic and educational programmes whilst in custody."" 

42This court has held in cases such as R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97, (2004) 145 A Crim R 304; R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207; and R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299,(2003) 58 NSWLR 581, that courts should no longer automatically find special circumstances simply because a prisoner has to serve his sentence in protection and therefore prison life for him will presumably be more onerous than for the general population. 

43In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22] Spigelman CJ said: 

""Simply because there is present in a case a circumstance which is capable of constituting a 'special circumstance' does not mean that the sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion"". 

44Her Honour described the appellant as ""the most unimpressive witness and his version of events could best be said to be imaginative to the point of being beyond belief."" She said he ""has no doubt told courts on many prior occasions of his intentions in that regard [as to rehabilitation] and he has breached the trust imposed in him by those courts and he has not complied with the orders or the assistance offered to him."" The appellant was neither remorseful nor contrite. Her Honour considered his prospects of rehabilitation as quite poor given his past failed attempts and despite what he might now say about his intentions for the future. 

45Her Honour found the offence was in the mid range of seriousness. The appellant conceded that finding was open to her Honour. 

46The appellant submitted: 

""What her Honour effectively did was consider the standard non-parole period of five years and then just dated that standard non-parole period from the date of the last sentence that had been imposed without considering the overall effect of the sentence in terms of issues of totality and institutionalisation and also the issue of protection."" 

47Submissions were made at the sentencing hearing seeking a reduction in the non parole period by reason of principles of totality, the prospect of institutionalisation and the fact that the appellant was in protective custody. Her Honour was well aware of those submissions. 

48She concluded 

""I have had regard to the submissions on behalf of both parties. I have had regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the factors in mitigation which are few. Only a sentence of full time custody will satisfy the requirements of general and specific deterrence. I find it is an offence which falls at the mid-range of objective seriousness as envisaged by the legislator. There is no good reason to depart from that guideline, benchmark or guidepost. I am asked to find special circumstances but I decline to do so. I can have no confidence that this offender would apply himself to an extended period of rehabilitation if it was extended to him. The statutory ratio allows for a sufficient period of supervision, it is entirely a matter for him what steps he will take in an endeavour to turn his life around."" 

49It is clear that her Honour had regard to the submissions on behalf of both parties which included the three matters referred to above. She considered they provided no good reason to make any adjustment to the sentence. 

50In my opinion it was open to her Honour to so find and no error has been demonstrated in this regard. 

51This is a court of error. Its powers in respect of an appeal on sentence are prescribed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The court will interfere with the sentence imposed in the court below only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error and then only if it forms a positive opinion that some other, less severe, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed - R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. 

52In my opinion error has not been established nor has it been established that some other sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal as to sentence, I would dismiss the appeal. 

Orders 

53I propose the following orders: 

1. Conviction appeal dismissed. 

2. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 

3. Sentence appeal dismissed.

2756930,Ishac v R [2011] NSWCCA 107,"Judgment 

1McCOLL JA: Hitcham Ishac, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal out of time in respect of his conviction for an offence of being an accessory before the fact to do an act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 and s 346 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the ""Crimes Act""). That conviction followed the applicant's guilty plea in respect of three charges. The applicant does not challenge the other two convictions but, in the event that his s 319 conviction is quashed, he seeks leave to appeal against his sentence so that it may be adjusted to reflect that fact. 

2The applicant's argument, in short, is that although he pleaded guilty, the facts underlying his conviction did not disclose an offence of perverting the course of justice and, accordingly he could not have been guilty of an offence. 

Background 

3The Department of Corrective Services employed the applicant as a Probation and Parole officer within the Bankstown Probation and Parole District Office (the ""BPPS""). The Commissioner of Corrective Services assigned the role of the Community Service Organiser to him pursuant to s 111 of Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) (the ""Administration of Sentences Act"") . In this role together with two assistants, he supervised all offenders referred to the BPPS for the implementation of community service orders (""CSOs""). 

4In May 2005 the Independent Commission Against Corruption (""ICAC"") commenced an investigation in relation to the alleged conduct of the applicant in his relationship with offenders assigned to the BPPS and the management of CSOs. In order to undertake this investigation there was extensive use of covert physical and electronic surveillance. This included a number of telecommunication interceptions pursuant to warrants under the then Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (NSW) for offences contrary to s 87 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW). 

5In February 2006 Mr Brian Khouzame was sentenced to perform 200 hours of community service for an offence of driving while disqualified. He received another CSO the same day which, on appeal was reduced so that, in total, he had to perform 250 hours of community service. He was ordered to attend BPPS. The applicant was his CSO organiser. Mr Khouzame was ordered to perform his community service orders at St Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church at Punchbowl under the supervision of the church parish priest, Father Elias Khoury. 

6Mr Khouzame undertook little of his community service. He made an arrangement with Father Khoury to obtain false certification of his compliance with his CSOs. The applicant knew of that arrangement. After Mr Khouzame was warned in writing by BPPS about his non-compliance with his CSOs, the applicant filed an application in the Local Court for the revocation of Mr Khouzame's CSOs. At the same time he warned Mr Khouzame of that fact and urged him to see Father Khoury ""to get it filled out"". It was common ground at the sentencing proceedings that ""it"" was a reference to Mr Khouzame's CSO timesheet. Father Khoury admitted at the ICAC hearings that he had falsely certified Mr Khouzame's CSO timesheet. 

7The applicant engaged in similar conduct in relation to a Mr John Tourni who he encouraged to falsify his CSO timesheet even though he had not completed his CSO. The applicant's conduct with respect to Mr Tourni was the subject of the first charge against the applicant referred to below, namely that he did an act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act. Mr Tourni pleaded guilty to, relevantly, one charge of perverting the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act. He sought leave to appeal his conviction on the ground that his conduct, as particularised in the Court Attendance Notice (""CAN"") under which he was charged, did not constitute a breach of s 319 of the Crimes Act, and an order that his conviction on that charge be quashed. Remarks made in the course of the judgment dismissing Mr Tourni's appeal appear to have encouraged the applicant to bring the present application: see Tourni v R [2010] NSWCCA 317. 

8The ICAC conducted a number of compulsory examinations of witnesses, including the applicant. He first gave evidence on 20 March 2006 that he had no knowledge of, or involvement in, any wrongdoing associated with the administration of CSOs. In later evidence, on 11 April 2006, he admitted that he had previously given false evidence. 

9The applicant pleaded guilty at Central Local Court on 11 December 2008 to the following charges: 

(a) Do act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW); 

(b) Accessory before the fact to do act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to ss 319 and 346 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the ""accessory charge""); and 

(c) Giving false evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (""ICAC""), contrary to s 87 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW). 

Four similar matters were taken into account on a Form 1. 

10The CAN specified the time and date and place of the accessory charge as between 19 February and 25 February 2006 at Sydney. The short particulars to the accessory charge as they appeared in the CAN stated: 

""That Brian Khouzame between 19 February 2006 and 25 February 2006, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did create a false Community Service Order time sheet with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice and Michael Ishac, before the said serious indictable offence was committed in the manner aforesaid, between 14 February 2006 and 25 February 2006 at Sydney in the State aforesaid, did incite, procure, counsel or command the said Brian Khouzame to commit the said serious indictable offence in the manner aforesaid."" 

11The applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court on 11 December 2008. The sentence proceedings took place before Sorby DCJ in the District Court on 18 September 2009. 

12A document setting out Agreed Facts signed by the applicant's and the Crown's legal representatives was tendered at the time of the plea in the Local Court and was relied on in the sentencing proceedings. The Agreed Facts relevantly stated: 

""9. Initially each of Mr Ishac, Mr Tourni, Mr Khouzame and Father Khoury denied any knowledge or involvement in the matter. After they were made aware at a Public Hearing of the electronic surveillance gathered by the Commission they made admissions of their involvement in obtaining and utilising falsely certified CSO timesheets and providing false and misleading evidence to the Commission. 
.... 

Count 2 - Accessory before the facts to Do Act with Intent to Pervert the Course of Justice 

42. On 16 December 2004 at Sutherland Local Court Brian Khouzame was sentenced to perform 200 hours of Community service for an offence of driving whilst disqualified (on 18 November 2004). On that same day Khouzame received a further Community Service order for an additional 150 hours for breaching a bond. This total sentence was reduced on appeal so that Khouzame was ordered to perform 250 hours of Community service. 

43 Khouzame was ordered to attend Bankstown Office of Probation and Parole. On 28 July 2005, Khouzame attended 2 hours induction and received two hours credit to his timesheet for doing so. Michael Ishac was Khouzame's CSO organiser. Khouzame was ordered to perform his Community Service at the St Nicholas Church at Punchbowl under the supervision of Father Elias Khoury. He was instructed to perform general yard maintenance at the church and to work from 8.30 to 3.30pm on Fridays commencing on 29 July 2005. 

44. By 22 September 2005 Khouzame had not performed any additional community service work and was sent a warning letter by the Administrative Assistant at Bankstown Probation and Parole. 

45. On 15 February 2006 Khouzame still had not completed any C ommunity Service work and at 9.57am Michael Ishac telephoned Brian Khouzame and warns him that there is a crackdown within the Bankstown office on people not performing their Community Service. Ishac said: '... they are checking who would be there and they've gone around last week and they saw that nobody was there, they've looked up, uhm like I've had your file at the bottom of my desk so nobody would see it for weeks you know what I mean, for months actually'. Ishac informed Khouzame that a Revocation Report had been lodged against him and that he would have to return to court on 2 2 March 2006. Ishac urges Khouzame to go and see Father Khoury. He said ' You still have a month to get it filled out'. 

46 The OIMS database for Mr Khouzame showed a document type being 'FTWAWD', which is an acronym for 'failure to work as directed application' and is commonly referred to as a revocation application. Mr Ishac was shown as the author of that report on 15 February 2006 at a time shortly prior to his telephone conversation with Mr Khouzame. Mr Ishac had told the ICAC that he was responsible for filing the Revocation Report with the Court. 

47. After a further conversation on 17 February between Khouzame and Ishac concerning Khouzame meeting Father Khoury, Khouzame telephoned Ishac on 21 February 2006. Khouzame tells Ishac that he had seen Father Khoury that morning and that Father Khoury '... already marked me off for two days' . Shortly after Ishac spoke to Khouzame in another telephone conversation and said, '... Like from now on, like put all the dates down on the sheet and just every time - just don't do it all in one go, just counting one day. Put all the dates, Monday to Friday. I've worked it out, up until you expire you'll just finished, you know what I mean ... Put 8 hours down for each day ... Then like what I'll do is I'll call the court a week before ,a few days before and say, ""look since I've put in the revocation, I've told him he's going back to court. The blokes gone every single day ... I want to withdraw it"". They'll withdraw it.' 

48. Mr Khouzame's time sheet, which is similar in format to that of Mr Tourni, shows that he had performed CSO work on 20 February 2006 and 21 February 2006 between 9am and 3pm and on 22 February and 23 February between 8.30am and 3.30pm. It indicates a commencement time of 8.30am on 24 February but no finishing time. Father Khoury has signed for each of the commencement and finishing times. Mr Khouzame has signed each entry on the time sheet. The time sheet is annexed to these facts. 

49. At most Mr Khouzame had worked at most half an hour for each day nominated on the falsely certified time sheet. In his evidence to the public inquiry on 12 April 2007, Father Khoury conceded that he had falsely certified Mr Khouzame's work hours, although he had worked a 'c ouple of hours' at the church. 

50. The falsification of Brian Khouzame's CSO time sheet was for the purpose of evading the terms of the CSO. Michael Ishac rendered advice, encouragement and direction about the way in which the document could be falsified."" (emphasis in original) 

Copies of the falsely certified CSO timesheets were annexed to the Agreed Facts. 

13The Crown Prosecutor handed the sentencing judge submissions to be taken into account on sentence. They included the following: 

""In relation to the assistance which the offender provided Brian Khouzame in perverting the course of justice, this included his advice on how to have the time sheets falsified and his encouragement of Khouzame to visit Father Khoury to have this done with the objective of avoiding an unfavourable Revocation Report being considered by the sentencing court."" 

14On 27 November 2009 the sentencing judge imposed the following sentences on the applicant: 

(a) One act of pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty 14 years, to a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 27 May 2010 and concluding May 2011, with a further parole period of 10 months to commence on 27 May 2011 and to conclude on 26 March 2012. 

(b) For an offence of accessory before the fact to doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to ss 319 and 346 of the Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment, a term of imprisonment of 10 months commencing on 27 January 2011 and concluding on 26 November 2011. 

(c) For an offence of give false evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), contrary to s 87 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 , maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment, a sentence of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 27 November 2009 and concluding on 26 May 2010. 

15In sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge read the Agreed Facts set out above onto the record. 

Applicant's submissions 

16The applicant submits that the act particularised in the CAN as an act of being an accessory before the fact to perverting the course of justice, is not in fact an offence. This is because Mr Khouzame's intention, as stated in the CAN, was ""to create a false Community Service Order timesheet with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice"" and the applicant's particularised criminal act was to ""incite, procure, counsel or command"" Mr Khouzame to commit that offence. He argues that the defeat of the revocation order was a consequential intention of Mr Khouzame's original intention to defeat or evade the CSO. 

17The applicant submits that the offence of perverting the course of justice for which s 319 provides, does not extend to an act done in the course of an offender's sentence - even an act of falsifying a document claiming a person has completed a CSO - because it is not an act involving ""the administration of the law"" as defined in s 312 of the Crimes Act. 

18The applicant argues that once a Court sentences an offender to a CSO and the offender has signed an undertaking to comply with that order, the Court's jurisdiction and judicial processes are complete. The Probation and Parole Service, a government body, then conducts the administration and overseeing of the performance of the CSO. 

The Crown's submissions 

19The Crown submits that the charge against Mr Khouzame of an offence contrary to s 319 of the Act was good in law, and hence the accessory charge was also good in law. 

20The Crown submits that the intention with which Mr Khouzame did the act of creating a false CSO time sheet was not particularised in the CAN and, accordingly, it was necessary to look at the Agreed Facts underlying the s 319 charge against him used on the applicant's sentencing. The Crown submits that it is clear that it was with the court appearance on 22 March 2006 in mind (see Agreed Fact [45]) that the applicant urged Mr Khouzame to go and see Father Khoury and falsify the CSO timesheets so that the process of revocation of Mr Khouzame's CSOs that had been commenced would be circumvented. 

21The Crown submits that this conduct was within the scope of s 319 as it was directed to undermining the capacity of the Local Court to adjudicate upon the revocation proceedings which had been commenced because of Mr Khouzame's failure to perform his CSO. 

Legislative Framework 

22The following sections of the Crimes Act are relevant: 

312 Meaning of ""pervert the course of justice"" 

A reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law. 

319 General offence of perverting the course of justice 

A person who does any act, or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice, is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 

346 Accessories before the fact-how tried and punished 

Every accessory before the fact to a serious indictable offence may be indicted, convicted, and sentenced, either before or after the trial of the principal offender, or together with the principal offender, or indicted, convicted, and sentenced, as a principal in the offence, and shall be liable in either case to the same punishment to which the person would have been liable had the person been the principal offender, whether the principal offender has been tried or not, or is amenable to justice or not. 

23It is also relevant to understand the provisions dealing with community service orders. A CSO is one of a number of sentencing options which operate as an alternative to full-time imprisonment under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the ""Sentencing Procedure Act""). The CSO requires an offender to perform unpaid work in the community for a specified number of hours: Tourni v R (at [11]) per Fullerton J (Simpson and RA Hulme JJ agreeing). The provisions dealing with Community Service orders are found in Part 2, Div 3 (Non-custodial alternatives), of the Sentencing Procedure Act, s 8 of which relevantly provides: 

"" 8 Community service orders 

(1) Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, a court may make a community service order directing the offender to perform community service work for a specified number of hours. 

... 

(4) This section is subject to the provisions of Part 7."" 

24Part 7 of the Sentencing Procedure Act provides 
""Part 7 Sentencing procedures for community service orders 

Division 1 Preliminary 

84 Application 

This Part applies in circumstances in which a court is considering, or has made, a community service order. 

85 Definitions 

... 

'offender's obligations' under a community service order means the obligations that the offender has under section 109 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 as a consequence of the making of the order. 
'period' of a community service order means the period within which the community service work to be performed under the order must be completed. 
Division 2 Restrictions on power to make community service orders 

86 Suitability of offender for community service work 

(1) A community service order may not be made with respect to an offender unless the court is satisfied: 
(a) that the offender is a suitable person for community service work, and 
(b) that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the offender be required to perform community service work, and 
(c) that arrangements exist in the area in which the offender resides or intends to reside for the offender to perform community service work, and 
(d) that community service work can be provided in accordance with those arrangements, and 
(e) (Repealed) 
(2) In deciding whether or not to make a community service order, the court must have regard to: 
(a) the contents of an assessment report on the offender, and 
(b) such evidence from a probation and parole officer as the court considers necessary for the purpose of deciding whether to make such an order. 
(3) A court may, for any reason it considers sufficient, decline to make a community service order despite the contents of an assessment report. 
(4) A court may make a community service order only if an assessment report states that, in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person for community service work. 
(5) If a court makes a community service order in respect of an offender, the offender must, as soon as practicable (having regard to sections 92 and 93) after the order is made, sign an undertaking to comply with the offender's obligations under the order. If the offender refuses to sign such an undertaking, the offender may be brought before the court and the court may revoke the community service order and impose such other sentence as it considers appropriate."" (emphasis added) 

25The Probation and Parole Service administers the community service order system in accordance with Pt 5 of the Administration of Sentences Act which relevantly provides: 

"" 108 Conditions governing community service work 

A community service order is subject to the following conditions: 

(a) the standard conditions imposed by the regulations, 

(b) any additional conditions imposed by the sentencing court. 

109 Obligations of offender 

The obligations of an offender under a community service order are: 

(a) to comply with such requirements of this Part and the regulations as apply to the offender, and 

(b) to comply with the requirements of any conditions to which the offender's community service order is subject ... 

110 Duration of community service order 

(1) Unless sooner revoked , a community service order remains in force: 

(a) until the offender has performed community service work in accordance with the offender's obligations under the order for the required number of hours, or 

(b) until the expiry of the relevant maximum period, or 

(c) in the case of a community service order that, under the Act under which it is made, can be satisfied by the payment of a fine, until the order is satisfied in accordance with that Act, 

whichever first occurs. 

(2) This section is subject to section 114. 

111 Assignment of officer by Commissioner 

On receiving notice of the making of a community service order, the Commissioner must assign a probation and parole officer or, if the regulations so provide, a person other than a probation and parole officer, to administer the order. 

112 Performance of community service work 

(1) An offender: 

(a) must perform, for the required number of hours, such community service work as the offender's assigned officer directs, and 

(b) while performing that work, must comply with the directions of the offender's assigned officer and of the offender's community offender services field officers from time to time. 

... 

(3) Any work that the offender is directed to perform must be performed by the offender: 

(a) at such times as the offender's assigned officer directs, and 

(b) in such manner as is satisfactory to the offender's assigned officer.... 

115 Revocation of community service orders 

(1) An application for the revocation of an offender's community service order may be made to the sentencing court, to a court of like jurisdiction or to a court that is superior to the sentencing court. 
(2) The application may be made: 

(a) by the offender's assigned officer, on the grounds that the offender has failed, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the offender's obligations under the order, or 

(b) by the offender, or by the offender's assigned officer, on the grounds that it would (having regard to circumstances that have arisen since the relevant community service order was made) be in the interests of justice to revoke the order. 
... 
(3) If satisfied that the applicant has established the grounds on which the application is made, the court may revoke the offender's community service order and (if it considers it appropriate to do so) deal with the offender in any manner in which it could have dealt with the offender had the order not been made. 
(4) An offender on whom a penalty is imposed as a consequence of the revocation of a community service order under this section has the same rights of appeal as if the penalty had been imposed when the offender was convicted of the offence to which the penalty relates. 
(5) A court that revokes an offender's community service order under this section must cause notice of the revocation to be sent to the offender's assigned officer. 
(6) For the purposes of this section: 

(a) failure by an offender to perform the required number of hours of community service work under a community service order within the relevant maximum period for the order is taken to constitute failure by the offender to comply with the offender's obligations under the order, and 

(b) failure by an offender to comply with the offender's obligations under one community service order (the primary failure) is taken to constitute failure by the offender to comply with the offender's obligations under every other community service order that is in force when the primary failure occurs. 

116 Summonses and warrants for attendance 

(1) The court to which an offender's assigned officer makes an application: 

(a) for the extension of the period for which the offender's community service order is to remain in force, or 

(b) for the revocation of the offender's community service order, 
may call on the offender to appear before it. 

(2) If the offender fails to appear, the court may: 

(a) issue a warrant for the offender's arrest, or 

(b) authorise an authorised officer to issue a warrant for the offender's arrest. ..."" (emphasis added) 


Consideration 

26The applicant appears to accept that if Mr Khouzame's intention had been to avoid the risk of his CSO being revoked that would constitute the offence of perverting the course of justice contrary to s 319, then his actions in inciting, procuring, counselling or commanding him to do so would constitute the offence for which he was convicted. In my view, for the reasons which follow, that was Mr Khouzame's intention. 

Setting aside a conviction following a guilty plea 

27The Crown did not object to the applicant pursuing a course which was effectively an attempt to withdraw his guilty plea. No doubt that is because if a guilty plea is entered as a result of a mistake or ""other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt"", courts will readily grant leave to withdraw it: Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 (at 599) per Kirby P; see also R v Murphy [1965] VR 187. 

28Where an accused person has pleaded guilty, he or she is thereby taken to have admitted to being guilty of the offence as charged ""and no more"": O'Neill v R [1979] 2 NSWLR 582 (at 588) per Moffitt ACJ, (at 596) per Begg and Cantor JJ. The plea is to be taken as an admission of the ""essential legal ingredients of the offence"" ( Chow (at 605) per Kirby P). Indeed as Giles JA said (with the agreement of Buddin J and Smart AJ) in R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 (at [51]) ""[t]he plea itself is a cogent admission of the ingredients of the charge"". 

29A conviction following a plea of guilty will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge, did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if, upon the facts admitted by the plea, he could not in law have been guilty of the offence: Meissner v R [1995] HCA 41; (1995) 184 CLR 132 (at 157) per Dawson J; see also s 6, Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and R v Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218 (at 235) per Lee J; R v Toro-Martinez [2000] NSWCCA 216; (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 (at [27]) per Spigelman CJ (Newman and Adams JJ agreeing). The circumstances in which a Court will set aside a conviction, notwithstanding a plea of guilty were conveniently summarised in R v Van [2002] NSWCCA 148; (2002) 129 A Crim R 229 (at [48]) per Greg James J (Hodgson JA and Kirby J agreeing). 

30Any miscarriage of justice is to be found in the circumstances in which the applicant came to enter his plea. The question in a case where the applicant seeks to challenge a conviction following a plea of guilty is not guilt or innocence as such, but the integrity of the plea. The material before the appellate court must show there is a real question about the guilt of the accused: R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61; (2001) 121 A Crim R 472 (at [33]) per Spigelman CJ (Simpson J and Carruthers AJ agreeing); R v Rae (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 380; (2005) 157 A Crim R 182 (at [20] - [21], [25]) per Giles JA (Hislop and Rothman JJ agreeing). 

31Finally, it is pertinent to bear in mind Spigelman CJ's observation ( Toro-Martinez at [29]) that ""[n]othing is more calculated to bring the criminal justice system into disrepute than to treat it as some form of forensic game."" 

The function of agreed facts 

32A statement of facts agreed for the purposes of sentencing upon a plea of guilty should extend to every substantial matter agreed between the parties on subjects which may later be said to have been relevant to the decision of an accused person to plead guilty: Gas v R; SJK v R [2004] HCA 22; (2004) 217 CLR 198 (at [43]). Such a statement should support the charge for which the offender is to be sentenced and accord with the offence charged: R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; (2002) 134 A Crim R 174; (at [21]) per Howie J, (Levine and Hidden JJ agreeing). Agreed facts should always be carefully checked by all parties and their legal representatives, and especially by counsel for an offender: R v Crowley [2004] NSWCCA 256 (at [46]) per Smart AJ (Wood CJ at CL and Hidden J agreeing). Neither party can complain if the sentencing judge acts upon their formal agreement as to what are the relevant facts: R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335 (at [37]) per Howie J (Dunford J agreeing) . 

33The agreed facts may, in my view, be considered to determine whether the CAN disclosed an offence. To do so is consistent with the approach taken to such an issue in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531 as explained in John Holland Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales; Parsons Brinckerhoff (Australia) Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 338. In John Holland , the applicants were ordered to appear before the Industrial Court of New South Wales to answer charges relating to breaches of s 8 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (the ""OH&S Act""). Each invoked the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to quash the orders and to prohibit the continuation of the matter in the Industrial Court on the basis that the prosecution charges failed to identify an offence known to law and hence were so deficient in law as never validly to invoke the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court. They relied on Kirk for the proposition that a statement of offence must identify the act or omission which constitutes a contravention of s 8 of the OH&S Act. 

34Spigelman CJ (with whom Beazley JA and Giles JA agreed - the latter adding supplementary reasons) discussed the approach the High Court took in Kirk to determining this issue. As his Honour noted (at [34]), the joint judgment (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) in Kirk (at [22]) considered the five particulars provided under the equivalent of s 8(1) of the OH&S Act, and three particulars provided under the equivalent of s 8(2) of the OH&S Act but concluded (at [28]) that those particulars were inadequate because they did not identify what measures the Kirk company could have taken but did not take. The joint judgment concluded (at [74]): 

""[74] ... Misconstruction of s 15 of the OH&S Act led the Industrial Court to make orders convicting and sentencing Mr Kirk and the Kirk company where it had no power to do so. It had no power to do that because no particular act or omission, or set of acts or omissions, was identified at any point in the proceedings, up to and including the passing of sentence, as constituting the offences of which Mr Kirk and the Kirk company were convicted and for which they were sentenced ..."" (emphasis added) 

35Counsel for John Holland submitted that the Court should focus only on the statement of the charge on the first page of each Application for Order to determine its application. Spigelman CJ rejected that approach (at [56]) describing it as: 

""...too narrow an interpretation of [ Kirk ] reasoning. Indeed, it is inconsistent with the reasoning in Kirk which ... analysed the particulars provided, as well as the charge. An Application for Order, in its entirety, is the document which invokes the jurisdiction of the Court. If the offence is appropriately identified in the document as a whole, then there is no reason to conclude that the jurisdiction of the Court was not properly invoked."" 

36I would add to this observation that it is apparent from Kirk (at [74]) that the question whether acts or omissions constituting an offence are identified sufficiently to found a conviction can be determined as late as the passing of sentence. That approach is consistent with the conclusion in Tourni (at [52]) that where there is a lack of particularity in the terms in which a charge is laid, the Court may have regard to the agreed statement of facts to understand its factual basis. 

The offence of perverting the course of justice 

37In R v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; (1992) 174 CLR 268 (at 280) Brennan and Toohey JJ stated (footnotes omitted): 

""The course of justice consists in the due exercise by a court or competent judicial authority of its jurisdiction to enforce, adjust or declare the rights and liabilities of persons subject to the law in accordance with the law and the actual circumstances of the case. The course of justice is perverted (or obstructed) by impairing (or preventing the exercise of) the capacity of a court or competent judicial authority to do justice . The ways in which a court or competent judicial authority may be impaired in (or prevented from exercising) its capacity to do justice are various. Those ways comprehend ... erosion of the integrity of the court or competent judicial authority, hindering of access to it, deflecting applications that would be made to it , denying it knowledge of the relevant law or of the true circumstances of the case, and impeding the free exercise of its jurisdiction and powers including the powers of executing its decisions ."" (emphasis added) 

This statement was approved by the majority (Brennan, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ) in Meissner v R (at 142). 

38The course of justice (which is synonymous with the expression ""the administration of justice"") includes the proceedings of judicial tribunals, that is, tribunals having authority to determine the rights and obligations of parties and having a duty to act judicially, but does not include police investigations as such. It begins with the filing or issue of process invoking the jurisdiction of a court or judicial tribunal or the taking of a step that marks the commencement of criminal proceedings: Rogerson (at 276) per Mason CJ; see also (at 283) per Brennan and Toohey JJ; (at 302 - 304) per McHugh J. The course of justice ends ""when the rights and liabilities of the parties have been finally determined and declared after 'an inquiry concerning the law as it is and the facts as they are, followed by an application of the law as determined to the facts as determined' "" (emphasis added): Rogerson (at 304) per McHugh J. 

39The applicant placed great weight on Einfeld v R [2008] NSWCCA 215; (2008) 71 NSWLR 31. That case concerned the making of false statutory declarations in relation to offences committed under transport legislation which provided for penalty notices to be issued. The penalty notices were an administrative procedure for the imposition and recovery of penalties as an alternative to court proceedings in relation to certain offences: Einfeld (at [28]). At issue in the proceedings was whether the offence of perverting the course of justice under s 319 of the Crimes Act, by reason of the inclusion of the expression ""the administration of the law"" in s 312 extended to conduct intended in any way to obstruct, prevent or defeat a government body in the exercise of its functions in applying and enforcing any of the laws of the State: Einfeld (at [21]). The Court (Bell JA, Hulme and Latham JJ) found (at [77]) that the phrase ""the administration of the law"" in s 312 should not be given its literal meaning so as to expand the parameters of conduct caught by s 319 of the Act, but (at [99]) should be understood to mean ""the administration of the civil and criminal law by Courts and tribunals."" The Court noted (at [90]): 

""We do not see how the expression 'the administration of the law' could be interpreted to apply to the police investigation of crime without also applying to the activities of other public officials whose functions include applying and enforcing the law of the State."" 

And (at [97]): 

""In our opinion, the words 'the administration of the law' in s 312 are not to be accorded their literal meaning, which...we take to include the exercise by a government body of its functions in applying and enforcing the law of this State. That meaning would result in a very wide range of conduct, including conduct that was not previously unlawful, being criminalised as a perversion of the course of justice. This result is a reason to consider that the literal meaning of the words may not be the ordinary meaning to be given to the expression in this statutory context."" 

40To recapitulate, the applicant's submission, in short, is that the act of falsifying a document claiming a person has completed a CSO during the period when the CSO is being administered by the BPPS, a government body, is not an act involving the ""administration of the law"". 

41A similar issue arose in Tourni . In that case the CAN charged: 

""That John Tourni between 22 February 2006 and 28 February 2006, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did create a false Community Service Order time sheet with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice."" 

42Mr Tourni pleaded guilty and originally sought only leave to appeal against his sentence. However the Court ""raised with counsel whether the charge as particularised in the CAN was sufficient to constitute a breach of s 319, whether on the basis of the facts tendered on sentence, the facts found for sentencing purposes, or both"": Tourni (at [5]). 

43The Court's concern appears to have stemmed from the fact that ""the intention with which the applicant did that act [particularised in the CAN] is not further particularised in the charge"": see Tourni (at [48], [50]). Moreover, the written submissions the prosecutor relied upon in the sentence proceedings, which appear to have been given to the sentencing judge, failed correctly to identify the gravamen of the offence and erroneously drew his Honour's attention to Mr Tourni's ""intention to avoid the terms of the CSO imposed the previous year"": Tourni (at [58], [60]). It was that intention to which the sentencing judge referred in his sentencing remarks and it was on that intention that the sentencing judge proceeded to sentence: Tourni (at [62]). 

44However the detailed facts said to constitute the offence were tendered on sentence and attached to the sentencing remarks, although not otherwise referred to in the sentencing remarks. Those facts ""place[d] it beyond any doubt that the applicant's intention at the time he created the false time sheets was to reduce the risk that a custodial sentence would be imposed when, within days of creating the documents, he was due to appear in the Fairfield Local Court for sentence"": Tourni (at [52]). 

45Fullerton J concluded (at [64]) that having regard to the facts that the plea of guilty was an acceptance by Mr Tourni of the essential elements of the charge and that the facts relied upon as establishing the offence were agreed and set out in considerable detail Mr Tourni's conduct in falsifying the time sheets and what he intended to achieve by so doing, the challenge to the conviction on the ground that the offence charged was not an offence known to law was not made out. 

46The observations made in Tourni from which the present applicant sought to gain comfort were: 

""50 Although the lack of particularity of the critical element of intent is not determinative of the conviction appeal, it gives rise to the question whether the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty, as particularised, was an offence at all. On the applicant's case that question arises in one of two ways. Either the lack of particularity resulted in the failure by the prosecution to identify, within the scope of s 319, 'the course of justice' the applicant intended to pervert by his admitted acts in falsifying the time sheets (which in turn led the judge to accept a plea of guilty when no offence had been committed), or the prosecution actually led the sentencing judge into error by inviting him to sentence the applicant on the basis that he intended to pervert the proper performance of those who administer CSOs so as to avoid the effect of a sentence that had been imposed upon him by a sentencing court, when that conduct is beyond the scope of the section. 

51 As to the latter proposition , it was common ground on the appeal that the scope of what is comprehended by the concept of perverting the course of justice in the extended definition in s 312 does not include obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the statutory function exercised by the Probation and Parole Service of overseeing and administering the community service orders referred to it by a sentencing court (see Einfield v R [2008] NSWCCA 215 at [97] - [99]). However, were enforcement proceedings to have been commenced by the Probation and Parole Service which may have resulted in the revocation of the CSO in the Local Court, and the applicant's conduct was intended to circumvent that process, there is every likelihood that conduct would have been encompassed by the extended definition in s 312. In Einfeld the Court held that the expression 'the administration of law in s 312 is not to be accorded its literal meaning so as would include the exercise by a government of its functions in applying and enforcing the law of this State. Rather, the expression is to be understood as extending only to include the administration of the civil and criminal law by courts and tribunals."" (emphasis added) 

47The applicant contended that the passages emphasised demonstrate that the intention the CAN attributed to Mr Khouzame of falsifying a CSO timesheet being an act done in the course of the administration of his sentence could not constitute the offence of perverting the course of justice. 

Conclusion 

48In my view the applicant's submissions should be rejected for substantially the same reasons as in Tourni . First, the applicant's guilty plea was an admission of the essential legal ingredients of the offence. Secondly, in my view the Agreed Facts made it apparent that Mr Khouzame's intention in falsifying his CSO timesheet was to avoid the application for revocation of his CSO proceeding in the Local Court; see in particular Agreed Facts [45] - [47]. The applicant's advice to Mr Khouzame was given to assist him to frustrate the application to revoke the CSO by falsifying his CSO timesheet to make it appear as if he had complied with the terms of his CSO. If this was not apparent from the Agreed Facts, it was certainly apparent from the Crown's sentencing submissions: see [13]. These were all matters to which, as I have explained, the Court is entitled to have regard in determining the basis of the applicant's conviction. 

49In other words, enforcement proceedings had been commenced to revoke the CSO in the Local Court, Mr Khouzame's conduct was intended to circumvent that process and the applicant advised him as to how to achieve that result. It was not conduct which merely occurred during the administration of Mr Khouzame's sentence. Rather it was calculated to impair the capacity of the Local Court to consider the application for the revocation of Mr Khouzame's CSO. That jurisdiction had been invoked by the filing of the revocation application in that court: see Agreed Facts [45] - [47]; s 115 Administration of Sentences Act. Mr Khouzame's conduct, in my view, fell within the meaning of perverting the course of justice in s 312 of the Crimes Act as explained in the authorities to which I have referred. 

50It is plain that that was the basis upon which the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant - he having read the agreed facts into the record. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that any miscarriage of justice has occurred. To conclude otherwise would invite the sort of forensic game the Spigelman CJ condemned in Toro-Martinez. 

51I would give the applicant leave to appeal out of time in respect of his conviction, but dismiss the appeal. In those circumstances the application for leave to appeal against sentence does not arise. 

52RS Hulme J : I agree with the orders proposed by McColl JA and with her Honour's reasons. 

53Hislop J : I agree with McColl JA.

		05 May 2011",2011-05-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2756939,Giannasca v R (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 1681,"Judgment 

1The accused (JG) pleads not guilty to the charge that he, on or about 12 January 2002, at Gladesville or elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, did murder his wife (CG). 

2At a pre-trial mention before me, it was indicated by counsel that a voir dire hearing was required before a jury was empanelled. A notice of motion was subsequently filed, whereby the accused seeks the following orders: 

1.The evidence of CV commencing with her interview by police on 7 January 2003 and thereafter should be excluded pursuant to s 138 Evidence Act 1995; and/or 
2.The proceedings the subject of the indictment should be permanently stayed. 

3Both counsel have informed me that however I should determine the motion, the unsuccessful party will appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Crown's indication of an intention to appeal is subject to instructions, but given the history of the proceedings, it is likely that such instructions would be forthcoming. It is for this reason that the empanelling of the jury has been further postponed. Mr D Dalton SC with Mr P Pearsall appeared for the accused and Mr P Barrett for the Crown. 

4The application pursuant to s 138 Evidence Act 1995 primarily concerns two interviews conducted by police in January 2003 with CV, the daughter of CG. She was 9 years old at the time her mother disappeared and 10 years old when these interviews were conducted. 

5It is the Crown's intention that CV gives her evidence in chief by playing to the jury the audio-visual recordings of the interviews conducted on 7 January 2003 (the first interview) and 10 January 2003 (the second interview). As CV was less than 16 years old at the time, she is entitled to give her evidence in chief in the form of the recordings, even though she is no longer a child: s 306U(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Section 306U is, however, subject to s 306Y which enables the court to order that CV's evidence not be given by means of a recording if it is satisfied that ""it is not in the interests of justice"" for her evidence to be given in that form. No application has been made by the accused that it is contrary to the interests of justice that CV's evidence in chief be given by means of the recording and the application for the exclusion of CV's evidence is confined to the s 138 Evidence Act argument. 

6CV was further interviewed on 7 August 2003 (the third interview), which was videotaped. She was subjected to sessions of hypnosis on 3 October 2003 and 20 October 2003, which were video recorded. The focus of the present application, under s 138 as I have indicated, is not upon the third interview and the two hypnosis sessions but upon the first and second interviews. The video recordings of these interviews were played during the hearing before me. CV was not called to give evidence on the voir dire. 

7I mention here that the accused's trial was listed before Buddin J in August 2009. Before the empanelment of the jury, objection was taken ""to the entirety of the evidence"" of CV. Without detailing the argument made during the voir dire that was conducted, his Honour upheld the accused's objection: R v JG [2009] NSWSC 1053. The Crown appealed against the ruling and the appeal was upheld (Basten JA and RS Hulme J allowing the appeal, Schmidt J dissenting): Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG [2010] NSWCCA 222. 

8Although the body of the evidence which was the subject of the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision is the same evidence that is now the subject of the present motion, no ground of appeal founded upon s 138 Evidence Act was advanced in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the application of that section was not considered. The Crown appeal was devoted to the correct principles to be applied to post-hypnotic evidence and the application of s 137 Evidence Act . It appears that the accused raised in written submissions before Buddin J an argument founded upon s 138, but his Honour did not determine this issue. 

9The accused invited me to return the matter to Buddin J but the adoption of that course would unnecessarily involve further delay and was not, in my opinion, in the interests of justice. As I have previously said, it is a pity that application was neither made to Latham J (the Criminal List Judge) during the mentions before her Honour nor the mention before me. Neither of the parties submits, however, that there is any bar to my hearing the present motion. 

10I also note that no application was made before Buddin J for a permanent stay and this issue was not considered upon appeal. 

Matters of evidence 

11It is unnecessary to repeat here the facts and events that gave rise to the accused being charged with murder. Those facts were carefully detailed by Buddin J: see R v JG particularly at [1] - [33]. It is sufficient to record that CV was born in September 1992. Her parents, CG and SV, married in early 1992 but separated in about 1994. The accused and CG married in June 2000. It is the Crown case that the accused murdered his wife on about 12 January 2002. Her body has never been found but as Buddin J observed at [1] ""there is other evidence available which leads to the seemingly irresistible conclusion that she is no longer alive"". 

12The Crown submits that the answers given by CV during the two January interviews are relevant to the issue whether the accused had a motive or reason to kill his wife. During the interviews CV revealed that the accused's father had been sexually assaulting her. The circumstantial case against the accused includes his serious financial difficulties, which required him to move into his parents' home, that CV told her mother and the accused that she had been molested by the accused's father, AG, that this conversation took place on the night that CG disappeared and an argument followed between the accused and his wife. 

13It is the Crown case that CG was very protective of her daughter, CV, particularly in light of the fact that an uncle who resided in Queensland was alleged to have sexually assaulted CV when she was 6 years old. Uncle N was tried before a jury and convicted after the allegations against him were reported to police. Upon appeal, the conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. As CG did not want her daughter to testify again, the matter did not proceed further. 

14The evidence is not only relevant to motive, but as Basten JA observed at [116] in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG , it ""would also have rendered implausible the alternative explanation of the disappearance of the deceased on that night, namely, that she voluntarily packed her bags and left the house without her daughter"". 

15Before proceeding further, I propose to refer to some of the oral evidence in a summarised way that was received on the voir dire before me. I do not provide a complete recitation of the evidence but should state that I have had regard to the whole of it in determining the issues that have arisen on the motion. 

16Detectives MacDonald and MacLeod spoke to CV at her school in Putney on 13 February 2002. The accused was present at the time. The police officers were investigating the disappearance of CG. Detective MacDonald described the conversation as being ""a chat with a young girl to see...if she could tell us anything which could lead us further"": T177.6-7. Detective MacLeod agreed that it was a brief chat to establish if CV could provide anything of assistance: T216.42. He created an ""investigator's note"" which recorded that ""[CV] stated she had no real recollection of the last time she saw her mother, except that it was during the school holidays. She could not recall anything of significance"": ex D. 

17Detective MacDonald gave evidence that the investigation team suspected that the accused, then a person of interest, could have coached CV to deliberately withhold information from police. He said that she was reluctant to give information and it was a possibility that she had been coached. Detective MacLeod agreed that whilst speaking to CV, he had formed the impression that she was apprehensive about speaking to police and he did not think that she was in a position to speak freely. He did not know how much she did or did not know but was concerned about the possibility that she had been coached and had not been revealing all that she knew. On this topic, his testimony included the following (T222.35-39): 

""A. ... I believe that she was coached. When I say coached, I should elaborate. She was in very close proximity to JG. There was a lot of eye contact reassurance as to she was saying, ""Was that the right sort of thing, dad?"" There was body language, which gave me that impression. I wouldn't say she was being untruthful, I just believe she was coached."" 

18On 22 October 2002, Detective MacLeod contacted Detective Sergeant Crawford of the Chatswood office of the Joint Investigative Response Team (JIRT) to seek assistance in interviewing CV (ex E). A briefing note was forwarded to JIRT as well as a brief outline of an interview plan. Detective MacDonald identified the document entitled Interview Plan for CV (ex 4) as the typed page he gave to the JIRT office prior to the interview. Some of the proposed questions on the Interview Plan were directed at the relationship between the accused and CG and included ""what has dad told you about where mum is?"" Another question was directed at the ""relationship with SV (natural father). Did she see him before mum went missing?"" 

19Permission was obtained from SV, the father of CV, on 11 December 2002 for his daughter to be interviewed and the interview was subsequently arranged to take place at the JIRT office in Chatswood. 

20The first interview was conducted at the JIRT office at Chatswood by Mark Wilson, a plain-clothes police officer, who was a member of JIRT. He had had over three years experience in roles, which involved interviewing children. During his evidence he explained that JIRT was a team made up partly by police officers and Department of Community Services (DOCS) case workers who ""were charged with investigating matters in relation to the sexual abuse of children, the serious physical abuse of children and any children at risk of serious neglect"": T30.46-48. He recalled that he had become involved in the interview as only JIRT officers were trained in interviewing children ""so any time there might be a child who might have witnessed an event that might not necessarily bring them under a JIRT assessment, we would receive a request from the Detective Office [sic] to interview the children for investigating police"": T32.22-25. 

21Both the accused and SV had accompanied CV to the JIRT office. Mr Wilson conducted the interview with CV that was video recorded. Detective Senior Constable Hayley Clark, a member of JIRT whose role was to monitor the interview, was in a separate room with Detectives MacLeod and MacDonald. Both JIRT officers recalled speaking to the detectives before the interview commenced. Detective MacDonald testified that he had told the JIRT officers before the interview started something along the lines that ""whilst they're interviewing her, ...try and canvas the fact with her if she has been told what to say, and if her answers appear that she has been coached, to explore that further"": T177.32-35. Mr Wilson had no recollection of anybody telling him whether or not CV had been coached: T72.35-36. He had seen the Interview Plan and recognised his handwriting upon the document. It was Detective Clark's recollection that the information that they had was very limited, that CV's mother had gone missing, they were to interview CV in relation to the information that she had and the only version she had been given was from the accused: 
T139.7-9. She did not recall the detectives saying to her that they considered CV had been coached to withhold important information: T141.36-38. 

22Mr Wilson had met with CV, her father SV and the accused before the interview commenced. He had no recollection of the specifics of the conversation but it was his practice to introduce himself and the person who was working the video and audio equipment, to the child and to the parent and guardian. He might then have a discussion with them or with the guardian separately and talk to them about how the interview was to take place. He would show them the interview room and the room where the other officer was. He could also have had a discussion with them about the length of time the interview would take. He would also have spoken about consent [being given] for the child to be interviewed: T37.22-40. 

23It is evident from the questions and answers in the first interview that Mr Wilson had spoken to CV prior to its commencement. He had shown her the interview room and the room from where the interview was to be monitored which included four television screens. He had also spoken to SV. He had explained to the child that Detective Clark was monitoring what was being said and could speak to him by the use of his earpiece during the interview. Mr Wilson told her that she could take a break at any time and explored with CV her understanding of telling the truth. He informed her that if she was asked a question to which she knew the answer but did not want to talk about, it was important that she told him. They would ""talk about...the ways in which it might be easier for her to talk about it"": (Q 84). 

24The child was not told that she was not obliged to answer questions, that she was entitled to obtain legal advice, leave at any time or have a support person in the interview room. She was not informed that Detectives MacLeod and MacDonald were in the monitor room with Detective Clark. 

25An unusual feature of the evidence was that Detective Sean Hampstead told me that he had not been in the monitor room during the first interview, whereas he had given evidence before Buddin J that he was in that room and he was questioned by Mr Buscombe about the conduct of the interview. Detective Hampstead explained that he had been mistaken when that evidence was given but had since checked his duty book and was on annual leave at the time of the first interview. I accept that Detective Hampstead was not in the monitor room when CV was interviewed by Mr Wilson. 

26At the time of the interview, there were procedures in place (referred to during the voir dire as JIRT protocols and guidelines) for, inter alia, the interviewing of children by members of JIRT. The introduction to the document (ex 5) which details those procedures included the following: 

""Joint Investigation Response Teams (JIRTs) reflect the fact that this is a statewide service, whether co-located or not. These procedures aim to assist staff in the delivery of consistent practice across the State. 
This document will be used in conjunction with the procedures and policies relevant to each organisation"": ex 5 p1. 

27Under the heading The Investigation Process , the procedures included (ex 5 p 11): 

""The child or young person's needs are paramount when determining who takes the lead in an interview, where the interview occurs and how it is recorded. 

... 

If a child or young person wishes to have a support person present appropriate arrangements should be made."" 

28At page 12 under the heading Investigative Interviews the document, inter alia, stated: 

""It is critical the interview is conducted in a way which supports and protects the child or young person. This includes advising the child or young person they can have a person to support them during the interview process. 

It is essential to review interview plans and consider the following issues: 

Use of non-leading questions, adherence to the rules of evidence and accurate recording of information are best practice. 

The continuing safety and wellbeing of the child or young person will be considered."" 

29The document provided Guidelines for the electronic recording of investigative interviews with children. The introduction at page 51 noted: 

""1.1 These guidelines are the procedures for the electronic recording of investigative interviews with children conducted by joint investigation staff. An electronic recording that does not strictly comply with the guidelines will not automatically be ruled inadmissible. However, the guidelines should be followed whenever practicable. The reasons for not following the guidelines should be documented. 

The best interests and welfare of the child are paramount 

1.2 The best interests and welfare of the child must be paramount whenever electronic recording of investigative interviews take place. 

... 

Training 

1.4 Every child is unique and the best interview is that which has considered the child's needs. No interviewer will conduct an electronically recorded investigative interview with a child unless suitable training is undertaken. The interviewer must be conversant with these guidelines. 

1.5 Unless otherwise stated, these guidelines apply to all joint investigations."" 

30Under the sub-heading Conducting the Interview at page 52, the guidelines, inter alia, provided: 

""3.4 In addition to the normal interview introductions and the requirements of the Justices Act 1902, the following points should be established: 

... 

Names, occupations and roles of all adults present 

... 

Include the second interviewer and any other person who may be monitoring the interview in a separate room."" 

31A Code of Practice for Custody, Rights, Investigation, Management and Evidence (CRIME) (ex 6) (the Code) had been published by the New South Wales Commissioner for Police in February 1998 and was in force at the time of the interviews. The Code made provision for persons who voluntarily attended at a police station. At page 45 under the heading People at police station voluntarily , the following appears: 

""Treat people who are voluntarily at a station to help with an investigation with no less consideration than those in custody (eg: offer refreshments at appropriate times). They are entitled to obtain legal advice, communicate with anyone outside the station or leave at any time. 

Investigating Officer 

Where someone, either in your company or by themselves, attends a station voluntarily to help you with inquiries, consider the nature of your inquiries and the likelihood that the person will be arrested. Where this is a possibility, albeit remote, take the person to the custody manager. 

Custody manager 

Inform the person: 

& why they are at the station and they are not under arrest and free to leave 

& they may seek legal assistance and can notify someone else they are at the station 

& that if the investigating police decide the person is no longer free to leave the investigating police are required to take the person back to the custody manager and advise that officer of the situation."" 

32Mr Wilson said that he was mindful of the JIRT policy document (ex 5) when he carried out the interview and agreed that he would also pay careful attention to any Police Commissioner's Code of Practice and guidelines that related to the interviewing of children. 

33He gave evidence that it was in the ""vast minority of cases"" that a support person would be in the interview room with the child. When questioned by Mr Dalton about having a support person in the interview room, he replied (T61.48-50; T62.1-7): 

""A. A support person in there can be a distraction to the child. I think I tried to explain that before, that you try to create a one on one environment where the child felt comfortable with you and to answer your question. Sometimes the support person could intervene sometimes in answering questions, which was obviously not something we wanted to happen. We wanted the information to come from the child. Sometimes the child would feel more uncomfortable talking about things in front of a parent or guardian or support person. Sometimes they would look at them for affirmation or permission before answering. Some of these things would make it quite difficult. They would not do it intentionally, just made it a little bit more difficult for us."" 

34Mr Wilson gave evidence that CV was not a person of interest, she was not suspected of anything. He had not seen any need to take steps to provide CV with legal advice or to caution her. She had come to him to be interviewed about her missing mother but it became apparent during the interview that she had an issue with her grandfather of which he had no prior indication. As the conversation developed, he saw CV as a victim. He wanted to find out a bit more about her. When asked by the Crown, why did he do that, Mr Wilson said (T39.8-12): 

""A. Again, talking about what the goal of the JIRT team was, the welfare of the child is paramount. Obviously I wanted to see whether or not something had happened to her and whether or not, I guess, if there was any sort of future risk of harm. Having looked at the interview recently, she said she was still living in the house, so that was obviously something that was concerning to me."" 

35In cross-examination he said that if the victim or witness was found during the interview to be someone who had committed an offence, then he would take appropriate precautions to ""possibly stop that interview"": T46. 43. He agreed that if, objectively, he had a suspicion that the child being interviewed may have committed an offence he would err on the side of caution. When taken by Mr Dalton to the Code, Mr Wilson said that he normally did not tell a child witness that they did not have to talk to somebody. He agreed that a child who attended as a witness should not be accorded any less rights than a person who was suspected of committing a crime or being a victim of crime. 

36Mr Dalton closely questioned Mr Wilson on the first interview with CV. It was in her answer to Q 177 that she mentioned her grandfather (AG). She had been asked about the last occasion on which she had seen her mother. After recounting what had occurred whilst she and her friend NL had been playing, CV said: 

""And then I think after the day she went home and then I, then I, I told my mum something though which I can't remember. And I dunno why she ran away. I just thought it was something that, something about my grandpa or something and she got really angry and like, so then I had to go to bed and the next morning she woke up really early, packed her bags and left."" 

Mr Wilson testified that CV's answer caused him to think there was something that she knew but did not wish to say. 

37I do not propose to repeat here the questions and answers that followed (most of which are set out by Buddin J at [30] in R v JG ) but at Q 222, CV was asked: 

""So, because I don't know your mum, so I don't know what she was like when she got angry. So what did she do to make you think that she was angry? Is it something about her that looked different about her? Did she say... 

A: She, she was calling him names or something like that but... 

Q 223 She was calling your grandfather names? 

A: Names like, probably like dirty animal or pig or something like that. 

Q 224 So she was calling your grandfather...something like a dirty animal or a pig... 

A Yeah 

Q 224 [sic] ... or something like that. O.K Now what was your dad doing when your mum was angry? 

A She called him and he, he came and that's when I told him as well. 

Q 225 OK. And do you know what you told your dad? 

A Exactly the same as what I told my mum."" 

38Mr Wilson could not say whether he had suspected before this time that CV was blocking something sexual but CV's answer at Q 224 might have gone someway to confirming that an inappropriate sexual relationship or incident had occurred. When asked by Mr Dalton (T80.36-38): 

""...you wanted to feel confident that you'd obtained all the information that you considered was available from this young person at that time?"" 

Mr Wilson responded T80.39-44: 

""A. I wanted to determine, obviously there was an incident that had happened. Obviously I wanted to explore what information I could get, okay. Whether or not that was asking open ended questions, whether or not it was asking direct questions or if it came to the point, asking a leading question to find out if something had happened to her, and I mentioned this before, whether or not she was at further risk of harm."" 


39He agreed with the proposition that he was not going to stop until he had obtained all of the information he felt comfortable with. On the topic of cross-examining CV or asking leading questions, Mr Wilson's testimony included the following (T82.29-49): 

""Q. What I'm suggesting that you're doing in the course of this interview is cross-examining the young girl? 

A. Whether or not you're calling it cross-examining the young girl, I'm conducting an investigative interview of the young girl through a manner of different questioning techniques. Some of the questions are open ended, some of the questions are direct questions. 

Q. You agreed with me earlier that you shouldn't ask questions of a leading kind? 

A. Only as a last resort. So for example, if I put this example to you, say I'm conducting an interview of a victim who alleges that certain offences have happened to her, it might be that I ask open ended questions, the alleged victim doesn't want to discuss it, I ask direct questions the same. It might be I'll ask a leading question knowing full well at that point there will be no prosecution obviously, in relation to any further police action, but from a risk of harm perspective, maybe the action will be taken by the DOCS case worker who might be involved. 

Q. You've determined that you're prepared to risk the evidence being admitted in any prosecution because you're concern becomes the welfare of the child? 

A. Yes."" 

40Mr Dalton took Mr Wilson to question 343 and CV's answer which is as follows: 

""Q 343 ...Now because you said before you've been telling me you can't remember what your grandfather's been doing, how do you know it's stopping? 

A: No, it's just, he doesn't do it anymore because there's people around. Because he mainly, he does it when there's nobody around which I don't know."" 

41Mr Wilson agreed that CV's answer would have heightened his concern, as did her answers to questions 345 and 346 that her grandfather probably did it in the bedroom of the house where she was presently living. Mr Wilson accepted that he had tried to obtain from CV specifics as to the nature of conduct that had taken place with her grandfather but CV would not reveal it. CV's welfare was his paramount concern. He then questioned CV about her relatives. CV made no mention about Uncle N but when asked (Q 355, 356) if she had an Uncle N, replied that he lived in Queensland but she did not want to see him anymore. 

42The following further questions were asked and answers given: 

""Q 357 You don't want to see him anymore? Why don't you want to see Uncle N anymore? 

A: Because he's done rude stuff to me. 

Q 358 He did rude stuff to you? O.K well we won't talk about that, that's okay. You said rude stuff, is the stuff that you say that Uncle N did to you, was it anything at all like the stuff that your grandfather ... was doing to you? 

A: Yeah, whatever is coming back. I've just gotta think. 

Q 359 O.K. Well you just take your time and think. There's no rush, there's no hurry. 

A: I think I'm starting to think now. I'm starting to remember what he did to me. How what did he do to me. 

Q 360 It's O.K. Well you can, you just take your time. You can tell me what you can remember maybe? 

A: Well its similar to what N did to me. O.K. Now I'm going to remember. He, well it was worser than he did to Uncle N than Uncle N did actually. 

Q 361 And can you tell me what your grandfather did? 

A: He did more rude stuff than what Uncle N did."" 

43In his evidence in chief, it was Mr Wilson's recollection that CV had discussed Uncle N with him. During cross-examination he acknowledged that someone else must have provided him with the information about Uncle N but had no recollection of where the information had come from. 

44Detective MacLeod did not believe that he introduced the subject of Uncle N, whereas Detective MacDonald believed that it was either himself or Detective MacLeod. He said (T192.1-9): 

""Q. And you considered, you considered, it reasonable in those circumstances, did you, to use the prompt of Uncle N to perhaps suggest to her via Mr Wilson that the events relating to her grandfather may have been sexual? 

A. I didn't want to suggest to her anything, I wanted her to - it appeared to me that she was reluctant to tell us what the incident with her grandfather was, possibly because she was completely embarrassed about it, which is completely reasonable in the circumstances, and that by suggesting that it was a way of her answering it without having to tell the details of exactly what it was."" 

45I conclude on the balance of probabilities that it was Detective MacDonald who asked Mr Wilson, indirectly through Detective Clark, to raise Uncle N with CV in order to obtain the details of what had occurred between the child and her grandfather. 

46CV was provided with diagrams of a naked man and woman upon which she made various markings to provide details of what she said AG had done to her. Diagrams were used by Mr Wilson to enable CV to talk about parts of the body that might be considered private or rude, without embarrassment. In cross-examination, Mr Wilson's attention was directed at questions and answers 435 and 436 which appear in the following context: 

"" Q 435 O.K. Can, can you tell me what? 

A. Well it's too disgusting but I don't, it also makes 
me feel very uncomfortable saying stuff like that. 

Q 436 O.K. Well I don't want to make, I don't want it to make you feel uncomfortable. I want to try and make it as comfortable for you as I can, Cassie. Is there any way that I can make it more comfortable for you to talk about? 

A. No, no."" 


47Mr Wilson agreed that, notwithstanding that CV had told him that there was nothing he could do to make it more comfortable for her to talk about it, he had pushed on anyway as he was concerned about the child's welfare. Mr Dalton then directed Mr Wilson's attention to questions and answers 440, 447, 454 and 460. Questions and answers 456 to 461 are as follows: 

"" Q 456 How does he disturb you? 

A. It's a little hard to tell 'cause I get really confused with stuff. It's just hard to say. 

Q 457 Because you, yes, because you said before it was about, that you mentioned before that your grandpa was doing, was doing something with the girl's rude part? 
A Yeah. 

Q 458 What was he doing with the girl's rude part? 

A Disgusting things. 

Q 459 O.K. Disgusting things. O.K. Disgusting things, what do you mean by disgusting? 

A Dirty things. 

Q 460 Dirty things. O.K. So it was dirty and it was disgusting I think you said. Did your grandfather touch you on your rude part? 

A Yes. 
Q 461 Yes? O.K. Because you tell me if I've got any of this wrong O.K. Because if I've got it wrong I need to know or if I've got it right I need to know as well. Did, so did a part of his body touch a part of your body? 
A Sort of."" 

48Mr Wilson agreed that his questions were becoming more and more direct as he was determined to get to the bottom of the matter regardless of the ramifications for the admissibility of the evidence. 

49The second interview was conducted at the JIRT office at Chatswood on 10 January 2003. Detective Clark was the interviewer and the second officer was a member of DOCS. Detective Clark, at that time, had worked in JIRT for two years. She explained that the second interview focussed upon the allegations of sexual abuse that had been disclosed by CV during the first interview and not upon the disappearance of CG. She said that there was no policy or protocol with JIRT that suggested that a female child should be interviewed by a female officer. There had been no particular reason why she had not carried out the first interview. 


50Detective Clark had been involved in excess of a hundred interviews carried out either as an interviewer, second officer or observer and there was no occasion when a support person was present. Her evidence in chief included the following (T125.27-36): 

""Q. What was the practice of the JIRT organisation or teams in relation to support persons? 

A. Due to the fact that there's no legislative requirement to have a support person; that's one of your first points. But the second thing is that we are taught not to have anybody in that room so to not contaminate the interview: 
So there isn't somebody there potentially influencing the child who's possibly been through a very traumatic experience; and basically so you're impartial and objective and it's just yourself who's independent to the investigation at that stage interviewing the child when there are no other distractions in the room. That's basically the reasoning behind not having a support person."" 

51When cross-examined by Mr Dalton on this topic, Detective Clark's testimony was as follows (T131.7-47): 

"" Q. Last one, child or young person wishes to have a support person present appropriate arrangements should be made? 

A. Yes. But I have never had a child wanting a support person there. 

Q. Have you ever asked? 

A. No. 

Q. You don't want one there? 

A. As I explained before, our policy is to look after the child. The child's protection and welfare is paramount and as a police officer investigating any potential allegations, which are generally quite serious if they come under the JIRT criteria, as an officer investigating that, as a JIRT officer, I don't want anybody else in the room with that child, unless the child has specifically asked me for somebody else to be in the room and I have never encountered that. 

Q. Your practice and that of the teams you have been associated with, you attempted to avoid, avoid, having a support person in the room when you are interviewing a young child? 

A. Yes, because it's for the benefit of the child. 

Q. That's despite the bullet point in the paragraph I have referred you to? 

A. Basically, to me, what that point says, there is an option for a support person. There is an option for the support person to be included in a JIRT interview. As I was saying before, I haven't encountered one, I haven't asked. If a child says to me or if I felt a child was potentially developmentally delayed and I felt a child needed a support person I would have asked. I would have organised a support person to be there. But from my experience and from coming from the perspective of dealing with a child and in the attempt of getting disclosures and getting information out of a child, I, as an investigator and working with JIRT, believe that a support person in the room is going to be - won't have a positive - I think it would have negative impact as opposed to a positive impact. And the less distractions in the room are pertinent to conducting that interview. 

Q. So a support person might break down the rapport you can establish with the child? 

A. I beg your pardon. 

Q. A support person might break down the rapport you seek to develop with the child you are interviewing? 

A. A support person could easily be a distraction throughout the interview."" 

52Detective Clark said that it was not necessarily her practice not to tell the parent of a child they could have a support person (T132.34-36). It was a decision she made but if she felt ""that the child needed a support person she would have looked at that situation and brought in a support person"": T132.37-38. She did not offer CV the services of a support person during the interview on 10 January 2003, as she did not feel CV needed one. When asked by Mr Dalton if she was trained contrary to the guidelines, Detective Clark replied (T148.2-3): 

""As I have said, they are a guide. You have to assess each situation as they come to the forefront."" 

53Detective Clark said that she had forgotten to tell Mr Wilson that there were two detectives in the monitor's room with her during the first interview and that had been a mistake on her part. The detectives had passed on information to her as the JIRT members had limited information concerning the matter. It was her testimony that if she had been of the opinion that CV was withholding information in relation to her mother's disappearance, she would have stopped and spoken to Mr Wilson about it, but at no stage throughout the interview had she believed that CV was ""withholding information in terms of any criminal participation on her behalf"": T142.39. A reticence by CV to disclose sexual interference would not cause her to suspend the interview. It had not been her take on the first interview that CV was withholding information to protect another person. She did not consider that a reasonable possibility. Detective Clark explained (T143.46-49): 

"" A. My experience with children, no, they are scared. They get very, very scared and quite often they shy away - from my experience, what they want to say or what has actually happened, they are afraid of reprisals, afraid of what might happen. They are frightened."" 

54Detective Clark said that she had been conversant with the Code in January 2003. On this topic, she testified as follows (T145.20-47): 

Q. Those rights you explained to CV on 7 January 2003? 

A. No, because she wasn't at a police station. She was at a JIRT office. 

Q. At the JIRT office, did you explain to her she could obtain legal advice, communicate with anyone outside the office or leave at any time? 

A. That's not the requirement of what we do, very separate to volunteers that come into a police station. 

Q. Did you advise her of any of those things? 

A. Potentially would have offered her a drink at some point. 

Q. I am referring to she could obtain legal advice, communicate with anyone outside your office, or leave at any time? 

A. No. Completely separate situation. 

Q. As far as you are concerned? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Investigative officer, where someone either in your company or by themselves attends a station voluntarily to help your inquiries, nature of your inquiries, and likelihood of the person arrested. Where this is a possibility albeit remote take the person to the custody manager. Is that correct? 

A. I agree that's what that says, yes. 

Q. You never consider that in any context of interview you conducted in the JIRT office? 

A. No because the children were brought to us either as alleged victims or witnesses. 


Argument 

55I do not propose here to provide an exhaustive exposition of the arguments of the parties, which are contained in extensive written submissions, but to provide a summary of the competing positions on the question of impropriety. 

56The accused's application for the exclusion of these interviews is founded on impropriety and not on a contravention of an Australian law. Mr Dalton initially indicated that an argument might be advanced that there had been a contravention of s 13 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1986 (T10.16-17) but that argument was not pressed: T232.48-50 - T233.1-2. In any event, it is my view that the provisions of s 13 do not apply to the interviews. CV is not ""a party to criminal proceedings"" as she is not alleged ""to have committed an offence while a child"" (s 13(2)(b)) and the statements made by her during the interviews are not sought to be admitted in criminal proceedings against her: s 13(1). 

57The contention of impropriety primarily concerns the conduct of the first and second interviews by police and is summarised in the affidavit of Siobhan Mullany sworn 1 April 2011 as follows: 

(i) The police failed to arrange an independent and or/support person to be present with [CV], then a 10 year-old child; 

(ii) The police failed to facilitate the child to receive the advice of a solicitor as to her rights in regards to questioning with respect to material matters relating to a serious indictable offence; 

(iii) The police failed to warn, caution or advise the child of her rights in this regard and/or any possible consequences to her regarding the revelation of material matters which she may have previously deliberately withheld. 

(iv) The police in the first instance had a male officer interview the child; 

(v) The police, being the interviewer and at least three other officers in another room, inappropriately manipulated the course of the material being elicited from the 10 year-old child during the first interview on 7 January 2003; 

(vi) The subsequent interviews were also inappropriately conducted but were all in any event tainted by the impropriety associated with the first two interviews. 

58Mr Dalton also adopted the written submissions dated 2 September 2009 upon s 138 made by Mr Buscombe, the accused's counsel in the voir dire before Buddin J. In those submissions Mr Buscombe contended that the first and second interviews with CV were conducted improperly. He argued that the evidence supported a finding that the introduction of questions concerning Uncle N and the linking of his activities to those of the accused's father in the interview, was done deliberately by the interviewer. All further interviews were said to be tainted by the same impropriety. 

59Senior counsel for the accused submitted that even before consideration of the relevant police guidelines it was most improper for police to interview a 10 year-old child on her own, let alone a 10 year-old girl police suspected was potentially deliberately withholding material evidence with respect to a serious criminal offence. The police were of the view she had been coached and/or was lying to protect her stepfather. It was pointed out that CV was not offered the assistance of an independent support person. She was not advised nor cautioned that she may be making admissions contrary to her own interest which may render her liable to a criminal offence (s 316 Crimes Act 1900). CV was not asked if she wanted legal advice, she was not told that she was only required at law to provide her name and details. She was interviewed alone by a male officer, in circumstances where the police had notice of a prior allegation of sexual assault, and the interview was permitted to continue even though it was decided to raise with her the circumstances of that allegation. 

60Another complaint was that the course of the interview was manipulated by the interviewer with the assistance of at least three other police officers in another room directing the questioning by persistent questions on topics when not satisfied with her answers. The accused contended that the police pressed CV to reveal what she said she could not remember and interpolated by suggestion that the complaint related to a sexual assault. This evidence, the accused submitted, which was induced by improper police questioning, would not be admissible in any proceedings against the alleged perpetrator of the sexual assaults. 

61Mr Dalton put to me that the manner in which the police conducted the first interview was improper and that the evidence that ensued was obtained as a result of a number of improprieties on behalf of the police. It was further argued that the impropriety existed regardless of the fact that the relevant police may not have subjectively considered CV a suspect with regards to s 316 Crimes Act or as an accessory after the fact to any offence involving the disappearance of her mother. Police were re-interviewing CV because they considered that she might have been withholding material information with respect to her mother's disappearance. The accused contended that CV was a suspect and should have been dealt with in accordance with the Code, that the JIRT protocols and guidelines had not been complied with and there was nothing to suggest in the guidelines any distinction between a child who is interviewed as a witness as opposed to a child who might be a witness but is also a victim. The guidelines applied to all joint investigations and applied in the current circumstances. 

62The Crown argued that ""the right to silence"" is not a universal and unfettered right of a citizen not to say anything. The right is a protection against self-incrimination, which is subject to specific statutory modifications. The Crown pointed out that all persons are obliged, consistent with various provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 including s 316, to provide information to authorities. 

63It was submitted that there were no legislative provisions that obliged police to caution a witness. The Crown contended that upon the evidence on the voir dire it was not usual or expected that police would caution a witness before taking a statement or commencing an interview. There was no evidence, the Crown argued, of a community standard that would support such a requirement and as the legal obligation of a witness differs substantially from that of a person suspected of a crime or in custody, it would be incorrect to advise a witness that he or she did not have to say anything. 

64The Crown pointed out that there was no legislative requirement for a support person to be present at an interview of a witness. Whilst the JIRT guidelines applied to the first and second interviews, the guidelines were merely there to provide guidance to police in carrying out their duties. Failure to adhere to the letter of those guidelines could not be the foundation for a complaint that the interviews were improper. 

65As to the failure to afford to the child an opportunity to obtain legal advice the Crown submitted that such a process was not required having regard to the age of the child and the fact that her father (and by reason of his presence the accused, as guardian) consented to her being interviewed. She was not a suspect but a potential witness in the disappearance of her mother. The Crown argued that to suggest that CV, who was under the age of 10 at the time of her mother's disappearance, might somehow be implicated in the death of her mother or might be a potential offender in giving false information to police, was absurd. Prosecutions for offences under s 316 could only be taken with the consent of the Attorney General and were a rarity. 

66The Crown submitted that there was nothing illegal or improper about the conduct of the first and second interviews. Direct questions and subsequent leading questions were only used after there had been disclosure by the child of issues concerning the grandfather. Mr Wilson had an overriding obligation to ensure the safety of the child and as she was living with the accused and her grandfather, which placed her at risk, it was necessary for him to use a variety of techniques to obtain the details of the relationship. 

67As there was not in this case any suggestion of impropriety towards the accused, it was submitted that, for that reason alone, the application should be rejected. 







Legal principle 

68Section 138 Evidence Act , is relevantly as follows: 

""138 Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
(1) Evidence that was obtained: 
(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
... 
(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
(a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
(c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
(d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
(e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
(f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and 
(g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and 
(h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law."" 

69Consideration of the matters that must be taken into account under sub-section (3) only arises if the court is satisfied that the evidence was obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law. The list of matters mentioned in s 138(3) is not exhaustive. 

70The accused bears the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities illegality or impropriety but once that has been established, the onus is on the Crown to persuade the court ""that the discretion and balancing exercise conferred on the court by subs (1) should, by reference to the matters set out in subs (3), and any other relevant matters, be exercised by admitting the evidence"": R v McKeough [2003] NSWCCA 385 at [36]. The discretion is to admit the evidence notwithstanding the impropriety or illegality: R v Coulstock (1998) 99 A Crim R 143. 


71The balancing exercise to be undertaken under s 138(1) requires the court ""to determine whether the desirability in admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained"". 

72As Basten JA observed in Robinson v Woolworths Ltd [2005] NSWCCA 426; (2005) 227 ALR 353 at [21], s 138 has a broad scope. It applies not merely to evidence obtained unlawfully, but also to evidence obtained ""improperly"". 

73The Evidence Act does not define ""improperly"" or ""impropriety"". In Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; (2009) 252 ALR 619, French CJ noted at [29]: 

""The meanings to be accorded to the terms ""improperly"", ""impropriety"" and ""contravention"" in s 138 were not illuminated by the Law Reform Commission report. The relevant ordinary meanings of ""improper"" include ""not in accordance with truth, fact, reason or rule; abnormal, irregular; incorrect, inaccurate, erroneous, wrong."" 

74In Robinson v Woolworths , Basten JA relevantly considered at [23] that the identification of impropriety required attention to: 

(i) The necessity ""to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as 'the minimum standard which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement'""; and 

(ii) The conduct in question ""must not blur or contravene those standards in some minor respect; it must be ""quite inconsistent with"" or ""clearly inconsistent with"" those standards."" 

75His Honour said at [36]: 

"" ...mere doubts about the desirability or appropriateness of particular conduct will not be sufficient to demonstrate impropriety."" 

76Howie J in R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; (2003) 57 NSWLR 82 stated at [20]: 

"" I am of the view that, otherwise than when subs 138(2) or s 139 apply, the court should determine whether the section is engaged having regard to the particular facts and circumstances before it but with due regard to the seriousness of a finding that evidence was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety and the outcome of such a finding. Not every defect, inadequacy, or failing in an investigation should result in a finding that the section applies merely because it may be considered that, as a result of those defects, inadequacies or failings, the investigation was not properly conducted or that the police did not act properly in a particular respect."" 

77His Honour, however, accepted that the conduct in question need not necessarily be wilful or committed in bad faith or as an abuse of power. 

78It is important to recognise that the evidence to which the accused objects must have been obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety. The accused bears the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing a causal connection between the impropriety and the obtaining of the relevant evidence: R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284; (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 at [86]; R v Cornwell at [25]. 

Consideration 

79The accused's application is for the exclusion of the whole of the first and second interviews and not individual parts of this material. Although the order sought in the notice of motion is widely cast so as to take in all of the evidence of CV, the Crown does not seek to tender the third interview and the sessions of hypnosis. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for me to consider whether any of these interviews were inappropriately conducted and tainted by impropriety associated with the first two interviews. 

80Amongst the matters that were said by the accused to give rise to impropriety was the contention that it was most improper for the police to interview CV, a 10 year-old girl, without caution or without advice as to her right to legal representation when police suspected that she was potentially deliberately withholding material evidence with respect to a serious criminal offence. In oral submissions, Mr Dalton explained that CV may have been considered a suspect having regard to s 316 Crimes Act in that she was a person who knew or believed that a serious indictable offence had been committed, namely, the murder of her mother, or by virtue of an attempt to interfere with evidence thereafter, to ""pervert the course of justice or [being] an accessory after the fact"": T231.44-45. Mr Dalton identified the perverting the course of justice as being if the accused ""attempted to interfere with her and the evidence she would give in relation to the investigation"": T231.45-47. The general offence of perverting the course of justice is found in s 319 Crimes Act . 

81Both Detectives MacDonald and MacLeod, at the time that they spoke to CV at her school in Putney on 13 February 2002, suspected that she could have been coached by the accused and was not revealing all that she knew about the disappearance of her mother. CV was 9 years old at that time. Detective MacDonald's evidence was that he told the JIRT officers before the first interview commenced something along the lines ""whilst they're interviewing her, ... try and canvas the fact with her if she has been told what to say, and if her answers appear that she had been coached, to explore that further"". Mr Wilson had no recollection of anybody telling him anything about whether or not CV had been coached. There is nothing in the Interview Plan that refers to CV being coached. Detective Clark did not recall the detectives saying to her that they considered CV had been coached to withhold important information, but her recollection of the limited information that had been provided, included ""the only version CV had been given was from her stepfather"". 

82I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the detectives did indicate to the JIRT officers a concern that CV may have been told what to say by the accused. At the time of the first interview CV was 10 years of age. None of the police officers, I find, considered that it was a possibility that CV was committing an offence contrary to s 316 Crimes Act nor that she may have been an accessory after the fact. 

83The accused, however, submitted that the impropriety existed regardless of the fact that the police may not have subjectively considered CV a suspect. The accused argued that, objectively, she was a suspect. To resolve this issue it is unnecessary, in my opinion, to consider the common law rule of doli incapax. 







84Section 316 Crimes Act is as follows: 

Concealing serious indictable offence 
""(1) If a person has committed a serious indictable offence and another person who knows or believes that the offence has been committed and that he or she has information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of the offender or the prosecution or conviction of the offender for it fails without reasonable excuse to bring that information to the attention of a member of the Police Force or other appropriate authority, that other person is liable to imprisonment for 2 years. 
(2) A person who solicits, accepts or agrees to accept any benefit for himself or herself or any other person in consideration for doing anything that would be an offence under subsection (1) is liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
(3) It is not an offence against subsection (2) merely to solicit, accept or agree to accept the making good of loss or injury caused by an offence or the making of reasonable compensation for that loss or injury. 
(4) A prosecution for an offence against subsection (1) is not to be commenced against a person without the approval of the Attorney General if the knowledge or belief that an offence has been committed was formed or the information referred to in the subsection was obtained by the person in the course of practising or following a profession, calling or vocation prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection. 
(5) The regulations may prescribe a profession, calling or vocation as referred to in subsection (4)."" 

85The essential elements of an offence of concealing a serious indictable offence contrary to s 316 Crimes Act , relevantly, are: 

1. A person has committed a serious indictable offence; 

2. CV knew or believed that a person had committed a serious indictable offence; and 

3. CV had information, which might have been of material assistance: 

(i) in securing the apprehension of the offender; or 

(ii) the prosecution or conviction of the offender for it; and 

4. CV failed, without reasonable excuse, to bring that information to the attention of a member of the police force or other appropriate authority. 

86It is also convenient to record here the essential elements of an offence of perverting the course of justice contrary to s 319 Crimes Act , which, relevantly, are; 

1. the accused did any act or made any omission; 

2. with intent in any way to pervert the course of justice. 

87As to the offence of being an accessory after the fact, the essential elements, relevantly, are: 

1. That a crime has been committed by a principal offender; 

2. That at the time CV rendered assistance to the principal offender, CV was aware of all the essential facts or acts that establish the precise offence to which it is alleged that CV was an accessory; and 

3. That with that knowledge CV had intentionally assisted the principal offender. 

88It is a logical leap from the suspicion of the investigating officers that CV had been coached, to conclude that CV ought reasonably to have been suspected of an offence contrary to s 316, or of being an accessory after the fact. There was simply no evidence to suggest that CV knew or believed that the accused (or anybody else) had murdered her mother, or if she had been told by the accused what to say to police, that the child knew or believed that he had done so with intent to pervert the course of justice, or that CV was not revealing all that she knew as she was aware of all the essential facts that established the accused had murdered her mother or was acting with intent to pervert the course of justice. Applying an objective test, on the information available, CV could not reasonably have been suspected of having committed an offence. 

89I reject the accused's contention that objectively CV was a suspect and should have been dealt with by police as such. 

90Before departing from this topic, there is another argument that should be canvassed. In submissions in reply, it was explained by Mr Dalton at par 13 that the accused's submission was not that it was likely CV was going to be charged but ""rather it was important for the police to make it known they had some suspicions regarding the child being coached to deliberately withhold material and this was a serious matter"". It was put to me that CV should have understood she could get into trouble as such if she did this, and that it was important to be truthful whilst at the same time understanding her rights. I am firmly of the view that for Mr Wilson (or other officers) to have told CV of these matters, would have placed undue pressure upon her and would have been inappropriate in all the circumstances. 

91Another matter raised by the accused is that before questioning CV, Mr Wilson was obliged to caution her that she did not have to say or do anything (the right to silence). It is not suggested, however, that s 139 Evidence Act applies as the child was not under arrest for an offence, but was attending at the JIRT office as a witness. I do note that neither the JIRT Guidelines nor the Code refer to a requirement to caution a witness, who is not a suspect. 

92Cases such as R v Patsalis & Spathis [No 3] [1999] NSWSC 718 and R v Frangulis [2006] NSWCA 363 suggest that the scope of the obligation to administer a caution is not as wide as that contended by the accused. In Patsalis , Mr Patsalis, the accused, handed police a document at a time when he was not suspected of having committed an offence. Kirby J rejected Mr Patsalis's argument that the document was improperly obtained as no warning had been administered to him. Kirby J at [41] said that there was no occasion to warn Mr Patsalis and there was no impropriety. 

93It is plain from Frangulis per Hidden J at [34] that a failure to provide a caution where questioning is undertaken by an insurance investigator acting in co-operation with the police does not necessarily render the admissions made unfair. The Court of Criminal Appeal did not consider s 138 Evidence Act in that case as the trial judge had expressed the view that the argument advanced under that section had insufficient merit and no ground of appeal was raised. 

94I would reject the accused's contention that there is a universal obligation upon police to caution a witness before commencing an interview. In my opinion, Mr Wilson was not required to inform CV that she did not have to say or do anything before questioning her nor did Detective Clark prior to commencing the second interview. CV was not under arrest, nor could she have reasonably been suspected of committing an offence. She was a 10 year-old child whose father had consented to the interviews being conducted. I conclude that there was no impropriety by the failure to give a caution. 

95The Code did provide that a person who was voluntarily at a police station to help with an investigation was entitled to obtain legal advice, communicate with anyone outside the police station or leave at any time. CV was not informed of any of these matters before or during the first or second interviews. It is evident that it was not the practice of the JIRT officers to bring these matters to the attention of children who were to be interviewed either as a victim or as a witness. The Code did not impose a statutory obligation upon the JIRT officers to comply with it. 

96The question remains, however, whether the omission by the JIRT officers to bring these matters to CV's attention did not accord with the minimum standards of behaviour that our community expects from those entrusted with the enforcement of the law. In my opinion, the community would not expect that a 10 year-old child, who attended at a JIRT office with the consent of her father to be interviewed as a witness, be told of those matters that the JIRT officers omitted nor would the community expect that such information be provided to such a child who was to be interviewed as a victim of sexual assault. The circumstances of CV's interviews did not require such information being communicated to the child. There was no impropriety. 

97Emphasis was also placed by the accused on the reference in the Code to where there is a possibility ""albeit remote"" that a person will be arrested, he or she is to be taken to the custody manager: see [31] above. In the circumstances of CV, there was no possibility that she was likely to be arrested and any reliance that the accused places upon this reference is, in my view, ill-founded. 

98Before proceeding, it is important to indicate that should I have concluded that the failure to administer or caution, or to provide the information referred to in [95] above, amounted to an impropriety, the accused has not established a causal connection between the impropriety and CV's answers during the first and second interviews. Neither CV nor her father gave evidence during the voir dire. There is no evidence, either express or by inference, that suggests that CV would have acted in any different way and not answered as she did, if the ""impropriety"" had not occurred. I am not satisfied that the accused has proven either an impropriety or that the evidence was obtained either directly or in consequence of an impropriety. 

99A focal point of the accused's contention of impropriety was the failure by police to arrange for a support person to be present when CV was interviewed. The JIRT protocols and guidelines that have been quoted at [26] - [30] above, included that advice be given to the child that she could have a person to support her during the interview process and if that was her wish, appropriate arrangements should be made. 

100The testimony of Mr Wilson and Detective Clark demonstrated that these procedures were not followed in practice by JIRT members and the provision of a support person was considered to be an option. The thinking was that a child might feel uncomfortable making difficult disclosures in the presence of a parent, guardian or support person, that the child might look at them for permission before answering or that they might be a distraction. It is unsurprising, in my opinion, that the JIRT members had adopted that approach in practice as a child's safety, welfare and wellbeing were of paramount importance and no questions of fairness to the child would ordinarily arise when the child was being interviewed as a victim or as a witness. This was the case with CV. No statutory obligation was imposed upon the JIRT officers to comply with the procedures but that does not answer the question raised of impropriety. 

101The omission by the JIRT officers to tell CV that she could have a support person present in the interview room if she wished did not breach, in my opinion, the minimum standards of behaviour that our community expects from those entrusted with the enforcement of the law. The circumstances of the first and second interviews did not demand the presence of a support person and there were good reasons for these interviews to be conducted without one. I do not find impropriety. 

102In any event, the accused has not established a causal connection between what was said to be an impropriety and CV's answers during the first and second interviews. There is no evidence from which I can conclude that if CV had been informed that she could have a support person present during the interviews: 

(a) CV would have requested a support person; and 

(b) CV would have acted in any different way and not answered as she did, had such a person been present. 

103I am not satisfied that the accused has proven either an impropriety or that the evidence was obtained either directly or in consequence of an impropriety. 

104Another contention of impropriety is founded upon the first interview being conducted by a male. There was neither a statutory obligation nor a JIRT protocol or guideline that provided for the interview of a child by a member of the opposite sex. I do not consider that the minimum community standards required that CV, a prepubescent child, be interviewed by a female officer. Mr Wilson was an experienced member of JIRT and I do not find an impropriety. 

105The next complaint of impropriety was the failure by Mr Wilson to introduce to the child, Detectives MacDonald and MacLeod who were present in the adjoining room. JIRT Guidelines for conducting an interview included introducing the second interviewer and any other person monitoring the interview. Mr Wilson did not introduce these detectives. Mr Wilson could not recall if there were other detectives in the adjoining room and did not know why he had not mentioned them. He conceded that he may have known about their presence but saw no need to introduce them as the detectives were not involved in the interview by talking to him. During her evidence, Detective Clark explained that she had forgotten to inform Mr Wilson that the two detectives were in the monitor's room and that had been a mistake on her part. The accused, however, invited me to find that the omission was deliberate as were the failures not to provide CV with a support person, not to advise her of her rights and not to caution her. All of this was said to be a deliberate taking advantage by police of the opportunity of manipulating the child's vulnerability, to test their suspicions that CV was withholding material information. 

106Both Mr Wilson and Detective Clark impressed me as honest witnesses who were doing their best to recall events that had occurred some eight years ago. Unlike Mr Wilson, who retired from the police force shortly after the first interview and had taken a position with Centrelink, Detective Clark has remained in the police force. She is currently attached to education and training at State Crime Command. My impression of Detective Clark was that she had a better recollection of the events surrounding the first interviews than Mr Wilson, which is to be expected, as Mr Wilson's attention has for many years not been directed at police matters. I accept Detective Clark's testimony as to how the introduction of the detectives came to be overlooked. Furthermore, I accept the reasons given by Mr Wilson and Detective Clark for the way in which the first and second interviews were conducted and reject the accused's contention that police took advantage of and manipulated a vulnerable child. 

107The omission by the JIRT officers to introduce CV to all of the detectives in the adjoining room did not, in my view, fall below the minimum standards of behaviour that our community expects from those entrusted with the enforcement of the law. I do not find an impropriety. 

108Another complaint that was made in written submissions for the accused, was that the child was not advised that she was not a compellable witness against her stepfather, pursuant to s 18 Evidence Act . It seems to have been accepted by Mr Dalton, in oral submissions, that there was no substance in this complaint (T233.27-37). But I should make it clear that the police were not obliged to provide such advice to CV. The appropriate time for there to be consideration of the compellability of CV to give evidence is at the time she is required to give evidence at the trial, but this issue has no impact upon the question of impropriety. 

109I turn to consider the accused's contention that the police ""inappropriately manipulated the course of the material"" being elicited from CV during the first interview. The essence of the argument is that Mr Wilson adopted cross-examination techniques including persistent questioning and suggestive questions, notwithstanding his understanding that adopting those type of techniques could have led to the evidence obtained, being held to be inadmissible in subsequent criminal proceedings. In submissions in reply, Mr Dalton identified the inappropriate questioning as having developed from Q 177 to the introduction of Uncle N at Q 355. 

110There was undoubtedly some persistence in the questions asked by Mr Wilson but persistence by itself does not mean that there was impropriety. Mr Wilson had no prior knowledge of any improper conduct by AG towards the child. CV's revelation in her answer to question 177 that it was something about her grandfather, which had caused her mother to run away, and her mother got really angry, justifiably initiated in Mr Wilson, the thought that there was something CV knew but did not wish to answer. Her subsequent disclosures at Q 222 that her mother was ""calling [AG] names"" and at Q 223 ""probably like dirty animal or pig"", unsurprisingly, lead to Mr Wilson forming the opinion that there might have been inappropriate sexual conduct by AG towards CV. The subject of Uncle N had been raised by Detective MacDonald as he was concerned about the child's welfare and he considered that it might overcome her reluctance to speak about what had occurred with AG. In my opinion, Mr Wilson as a JIRT officer, had a duty to ascertain the facts which beared upon the possibility that the child had been sexually assaulted and he was not bound to accept her reticence to answer. 

111The introduction of Uncle N at Q 355 and the question at 358 as to whether ""the stuff"" that Uncle N had done to CV ""was anything at all like the stuff that your grandfather ...was doing to you"" were leading questions that were asked by Mr Wilson to ascertain what had happened to the child and as to whether she was at further risk of harm. He continued to ask questions, which included the leading question at 460 ""Did your grandfather touch you on your rude part?"" Mr Wilson did so as he was determined to ascertain what had happened. Although there was some persistence and leading questions were asked, I do not consider that there was any intimidation, persistent importunity or sustained or undue insistence or pressure by Mr Wilson in the interview. 

112I accept, however, that the manner in which the questions were asked carry with it a risk that CV had been ""led by suggestion to identify falsely the matter of complaint to her mother and [the accused]"" on the evening before CG disappeared: Basten JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG at [128]. It does not necessarily follow that there was impropriety. 

113As has been quoted at [28] above, the JIRT procedures for Investigative Interviews included a consideration of ""use of non-leading questions"" and ""adherence to the rules of evidence"". The procedures also provided that ""the continuing safety and wellbeing of the child ...will be considered"". A Key Principle of a JIRT investigation was that the child's safety, welfare and wellbeing were of paramount importance (ex 5 p 3). The Guidelines for the electronic recording of investigative interviews with children emphasised at p 51 the pre-eminence of the child's best interests and welfare. Although Mr Wilson asked leading questions and, in that way, did not comply with the JIRT procedures, he did so as he was genuinely concerned for the child's welfare and safety. At the time of the interview, CV was living with the accused and AG. In these circumstances, the community would expect that a JIRT officer would attach the utmost importance to the child's safety. There were no questions of fairness to the child to be considered and, in my opinion, the minimum standards of behaviour that our community expects from those entrusted with the enforcement of the law were not breached by the way the first interview was conducted. I do not accept the accused's contention of inappropriate manipulation by police during the interview. I do not find that there was impropriety. 

114I have not previously mentioned the evidence of Dr Roberts and Dr Samuels, both psychiatrists, that was given in the voir dire before Buddin J. His Honour summarised at [34] - [38] in R v JG those parts of the psychiatrists' testimony that were of significance to the first and second interviews. The transcripts of their evidence are included in the material tendered before me. Dr Robert's report dated 3 August 2009 is in evidence (ex B) as is his report dated 11 April 2011 (ex C). 

115Dr Roberts gave evidence on the voir dire before me, the thrust of which was directed at observations made by Basten JA in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG at [93] - [98]. Notwithstanding the additional evidence provided by Dr Roberts to deal with Basten JA's observation at [96] that the psychiatrist's ""curriculum vitae did not indicate any specific training or experience in dealing with young children"", Dr Roberts gave evidence in cross-examination that his practice was primarily concerned with adult psychiatry, that he had not interviewed children and had no experience in obtaining evidence from them. His expertise to comment upon the impact that the questions asked during the first and second interviews may have had upon the child is not based on a solid foundation, but for present purposes that is a matter of weight to be given to his testimony. Neither of the psychiatrists had the benefit of considering the evidence of Mr Wilson and Detective Clark and the paramount importance that they attached to the safety and wellbeing of the child. 

116Although the opinions of the psychiatrists as to the conduct of the first and second interviews are relevant, I have attached little weight to them in considering whether the evidence was obtained improperly or in consequence of an impropriety. 

117One of the accused's submissions makes reference to CV's answers not being admissible in proceedings against AG for sexual assault. It is unnecessary to deal with this issue, other than to state that the reality of the present complaint is not one of impropriety in obtaining the evidence but how the Crown intends to use it in the trial. This gives rise to those matters under s 137 Evidence Act that the Court of Criminal Appeal has considered. 

118Each of the accused's complaints of impropriety has been considered individually and no impropriety has been established. When the complaints are considered in combination, I am also not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the evidence was obtained improperly or in consequence of an impropriety. Furthermore, I should state, that I am not satisfied that there was any impropriety in the way that the second interview of CV was conducted by Detective Clark or that the answers CV gave were obtained improperly or in consequence of an impropriety. 

119Should I be wrong about those matters, I turn to s 138(3) Evidence Act . Under subsection (3)(a) the court is to take into account ""the probative value of the evidence"". In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG, Basten JA considered at [118] that if accepted, the evidence in the first and second interviews had ""high probative value"", whereas RS Hulme J at [156] regarded that evidence as having ""significant probative value"". Various submissions were made by Mr Dalton (at par 93(a) AWS) but none of the arguments advanced diminish, to my mind, the assessments made by Basten JA and RS Hulme J of the probative value of CV's answers. 

120Mr Dalton further argued that issues of reliability are to be taken into account in a s 138 application. Reliance was placed upon the citation by Spigelman CJ at [6] in R v Dalley of a passage from the judgment of Deane J in Pollard v The Queen [1992] HCA 69; (1992) 176 CLR 177 at 203-204. 

121The Chief Justice in Dalley , cited what was said by Deane J, to support the conclusion that the more serious the offence, the less likely the discretion under s 138 will be exercised in favour of exclusion. The Court of Criminal Appeal in that case did not closely consider the meaning of ""the probative value of the evidence"" in s 138(3). Furthermore, Pollard was a case that preceded the Evidence Act . 

122In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228, Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed), construed s 137 Evidence Act as focussing attention on the capability of the evidence to have a particular effect, rather than its reliability, which is a matter for the jury. Spigelman CJ said at [61] - [63]: 

""In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment ... "". The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has ""probative value"", as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty. 

This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ""rationally affect"" the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in Adam , a ""test"" of ""rationality"" also directs attention to capability rather than weight. 

There will be circumstances, as envisaged by Simpson J in Cook supra, where issues of credibility or reliability are such that it is possible for a court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. In that limited sense McHugh J's observations in Papakosmas that ""considerations of reliability are necessarily involved"" have application."" 

123In reaching this conclusion, the Chief Justice had analysed the words ""probative value"" as defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act . The meaning of the words ""probative value"" in s 138(3)(a) must be, in my opinion, the same as those found in s 137 as they depend upon a common definition. It is my conclusion that questions of reliability do not apply to the present evidence. I do not think that there are circumstances in the present case, as referred to by Simpson J in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [43], from which it is possible for the court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. 

124The evidence has, in my opinion, at the least, significant probative value. 

125As to s 138(3)(b), the evidence is plainly of importance in the proceedings. The offence is one of the utmost gravity: s 138(3)(c). While I have not found impropriety, any impropriety if it existed, would not be of a major kind: s 138(3)(d). Should my conclusions of impropriety be wrong in respect of the manner in which the first interview was conducted, the impropriety would be intentional but motivated by Mr Wilson's concerns for the child's safety and wellbeing as would be the failure to advise CV that she could have a support person present if she wished: s 138(3)(e). 

126I do not consider that there has been any contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights : s 138(3)(f). It is unlikely that there will be any proceedings taken in relation to the impropriety: s 138(3)(g). The reticence of CV, a 10 year-old child, to make disclosures of sexual misconduct made it difficult for Mr Wilson to obtain the evidence without the use of persistence and leading questions: s 138(3)(h). 

127Carrying out the balancing exercise, I consider that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. I reject the application made under s 138 Evidence Act to exclude CV's evidence. 

The application for a permanent stay 

128The basis of the application for the permanent stay is that: 

(a) The police, in the first interview with CV, through a combination of systemic failure and individual recklessness, unfairly generated damaging evidence against the accused. 

(b) The resultant evidence is unquestionably unreliable. 

(c) Because of the nature of the police questioning, the factors operating to make the evidence unreliable cannot now be nullified. 

(d) The degree of unreliability - particularly after the interview under hypnosis - cannot now be quantified. 

(e) Even with the evidence of the subject interviews the case against the accused is not strong. 

(f) Any trial permitted to be based on the subject interviews would be so permeated by the improper police conduct that it would be rendered unfair to the accused. 

129The accused contended that even if the first and second interviews were to be admitted, the prosecution is ""still doomed to fail"". The evidence did not provide the Crown case even on a ""strands in the cable basis"" with sufficient evidence for a sustainable finding of guilt. In all the circumstances, to permit the prosecution to continue would be oppressive such as to constitute an abuse of process. It was put to me that the reliability of CV's evidence had been compromised because of the manner in which the police had conducted the interviews, which had become exacerbated by the many subsequent interviews, two of which involve hypnosis and were conducted in disregard of the relevant police guidelines. Unfairness, Mr Dalton submitted, should be considered as a separate head of abuse in the context of the stay application. 

130Another argument that senior counsel advanced was that the Crown does not seek to rely upon the reliability of CV's evidence with respect to the alleged sexual assault but only as to the complaint by the child to her mother and the accused on the night before CG disappeared. There will be unfairness to the accused because AG's credit will be, Mr Dalton submitted, totally undermined by these allegations, which ""will have a most damaging run off effect on the accused and his account as to the circumstances of his wife leaving the house"". Mr Dalton contended that ""for the prosecution to seek to use evidence in this way when it is conceded it cannot otherwise [be used] against AG also constitutes an abuse of process"": AWS at par 35(d). 

131What was stated to be a final submission was that the prosecution should not be able to pick and choose in what proceedings it wishes to lead evidence that it accepts (as it must) as unreliable in at least one type of prosecution. To permit the prosecution to so proceed would lead, it was submitted, to such inconsistency as to undermine the public confidence in the administration of justice and constitute an abuse of process. 

132The Crown informed the court that it was not his intention to call AG nor did he seek to establish that AG had sexually assaulted the child. The Crown repeated what had been said on prior occasions, that the purpose of CV's evidence was to establish her complaint to her mother of sexual assault by AG on the evening before CG disappeared. The Crown submitted that the accused's argument that the reliability of the child's evidence had been undermined by subsequent events was a rehash under another guise of the submissions to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG . As to the submission that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt, the Crown contended that such a submission was premature and amounted to a ""prima facie"" case submission, which should be made at the conclusion of the Crown case. 

133Amongst the submissions made for the accused in reply was that AG was to be an important witness in corroborating the accused but the jury's inevitable consideration of the sexual assault allegations constitutes an intolerable unfairness. The accused, it was said, will be required to try and defend these allegations against AG to defend himself when there was no foundation to them and no report was made to him and CG the night before she left. 

134In Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20, the High Court of Australia dismissed an appeal against the refusal of a permanent stay in a murder trial. The High Court at [18] cited what was said in R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605 - 606 by Mason CJ and Toohey J that: 

""[A] permanent stay will only be ordered in an extreme case and there must be a fundamental defect of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences."" 

135The High Court declared that the above statement should be regarded as an authoritative statement of principle. The Court observed at [35] that there is no definitive category of extreme case in which a permanent stay of criminal proceeding will be ordered. 

136The Court observed at [37]: 

""A further consideration is the need to take into account the substantial public interest of the community in having those charged with criminal offences brought to trial. Because of this public interest, fairness to the accused is not the only consideration bearing on a court's decision as to whether a trial should proceed."" 

137I do not consider that the accused has established a fundamental defect that goes to the root of the trial. Although the video-recordings will be played to the jury, CV will be available for cross-examination. CV did not give evidence upon the voir dire and I have no idea what she will say under cross-examination. Mr Dalton referred to the Crown having served a s 38 Evidence Act notice and to the Crown's intention to cross-examine CV. The Crown has not informed me of these matters. Should it be the case that the Crown seeks the leave of the court to cross-examine CV about any of the three subjects described in s 38(1) and leave is granted, the jury will have the opportunity of assessing the honesty and reliability of her evidence when questioned by the Crown and in cross-examination by counsel for the accused. Furthermore, as Basten JA pointed out in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG at [124] expert evidence could be called before the jury, with the court's leave, ""by way of an opinion that the mode of questioning could substantially affect the credibility of the daughter"". To that, I would add that expert evidence could be called as to the impact that the two sessions of hypnosis might have upon CV's recollections of what had occurred. The jury might be warned, upon the accused's application, that CV's evidence was ""of a kind that may be unreliable"" for the purposes of s 165(1) Evidence Act . 

138As to the contention of an intolerable unfairness by the adverse effect that the sexual assault allegations will have upon AG's evidence, who is considered to be an important witness for the accused, AG's evidence would be before the jury for it's consideration in combination with any expert evidence and the jury warning under s 165 Evidence Act . Furthermore, it is open to the accused to give evidence at his trial. It is a matter for the jury, considering all the evidence before it, to make an assessment of the honesty and reliability of CV's evidence. In my opinion, unfairness to the accused has not been demonstrated. 

139The proposition that the Crown case is ""doomed to fail"" and it would be oppressive to permit the case to continue is made without any proper basis. The statements of all Crown witnesses were not tendered upon the voir dire and the oral evidence was confined to the issues concerning the first and second interviews. The strength of the Crown case was not canvassed and I do not accede to the accused's invitation to find that there is insufficient evidence to sustain a finding of guilt. 







140I conclude that the present case is not extreme and the application for a permanent stay is refused. 

Orders

		14 February 2012",2011-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2756946,R v Tarantello [2011] NSWSC 383,"Judgment 

1The accused, Giuseppe Tarantello, is charged under s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 with having murdered Frank Amore on 13 May 2009 at Haberfield. On 25 May 2010, under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 ('the Act'), Davies J found that the accused was unfit to be tried for the offence charged (see R v Tarantello [2010] NSWSC 469). He was remanded in custody and the matter was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 14 of the Act for determination under s 16. 

2In February 2011, under s 19 of the Act, the Director of Public Prosecutions notified the Court of his intention to proceed with the charge and sought that a special hearing be fixed for that purpose. In March 2011, the Tribunal conducted a fourth review of the accused's care, treatment and detention, at a time when he was detained at the Long Bay Prison Hospital. It determined under s 46(1) of the Act that the accused should be transferred to a forensic hospital for care, treatment and control and under s 47, that the accused was not fit to be tried for the offence. The Tribunal also recommended to the Court that no further fitness inquiry be conducted in relation to the accused. 

3Section 19(2) of the Act provides that the purpose of a special hearing is to ensure, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with normal procedures, that the person is acquitted, unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof, that on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged, or any other offence available, as an alternative to the offence charged. 

4In such a case, pursuant to s 21(3) of the Act, the accused is taken to have pleaded not guilty to the offence charged. The accused is entitled to raise any defence that could be properly raised, if this special hearing were an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings. 

5This special hearing was conducted before me as a judge sitting alone, the accused not having made an election pursuant to s 21A of the Act to have the hearing conducted before a jury. The accused was represented by Ms Manuell SC at the hearing, who confirmed the existence of difficulties in relation to the accused giving instructions, particularly as to the cross examination of any witnesses. In accordance with the approach discussed by the Chief Justice in R v Zvonaric [2001] NSWCCA 505, however, s 21(1) of the Act required that the special hearing be conducted as 'nearly as possible as if it were a trial of a criminal proceedings'. 

6The verdicts available at a special hearing are provided by s 22(1) of the Act, namely: 
""(a) not guilty of the offence charged, 
(b) not guilty on the ground of mental illness, 
(c) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged, 
(d) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged."" 

7Section 38 of the Act provides that if it appears on the evidence at trial that the accused 'was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made,' then a special verdict must be returned 'that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness'. 

8If such a verdict is returned, under s 39 of the Act the Court may order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit, until released by due process of law. Section 39 also provides that: 
""(2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release."" 

The facts 

9By consent, three large folders of documentary material that comprised the Crown case were tendered. They included witness statements and various documentary material, including a record of a 000 call made by the accused on 13 May 2009; photographs taken that day; a record of the police interview of the accused conducted that day; and various psychiatric reports. Some witnesses were not called to give oral evidence, but oral evidence was called from two police officers who responded to the accused's 000 call and attended Mr Amore's home, where the accused was found with his body. Both the 000 recording and the recording of the accused's record of interview were played in Court. 

10The facts were not in issue. The accused is now aged some 41 years. When he was aged about 30 years, he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He received treatment for that condition, from which he continued to suffer at the time of Mr Amore's death. At that time the accused lived alone at Five Dock, in premises owned by his mother, Paola Tarantello. Mr Amore was her partner and they had lived together at their home at Haberfield for some 10 years. 

11At the time of Mr Amore's death, the accused was being treated by a psychiatrist and was receiving an injection of medication for his illness every second Wednesday from his GP. He was also prescribed oral medication to be taken daily. 

12On the date of the offence, Wednesday 13 May 2009, the accused's mother was due to travel to Berrima by bus on a daytrip for a pilgrimage to a holy site. The accused had stayed overnight with his mother and Mr Amore at their home. That morning the accused told his mother at about 6.15 am, that he was going to a nearby shop. He returned about 15 minutes later and asked his mother if she had to go. She told him that she was going to pray for him because he was sick. Later she had a conversation with Mr Amore, who told her 'Don't listen to him. He's a spoilt brat sometimes'. She was not sure if the accused overheard this conversation, but there was no friction between he and Mr Amore that morning. 

13The bus was due to leave Haberfield at 8 am. Shortly after 7:30 am, Mr Amore and the accused drove his mother to the bus stop. Mr Amore offered to take the accused later to the Medical Centre for his injection which was due that day and suggested that they 'make some chicken soup for mum when she comes home'. 

14When the police arrived at the Haberfield house at about 8.40 am, when they responded to a 000 call made by the accused at 8.32 am, they found him alone there with Mr Amore's body. The accused was covered in blood. Mr Amore's car was parked in the driveway at the side of the house. The accused's car was parked on the street at the front of the house. The keys to the accused's car were later found under Mr Amore's body. 

15Between 8:15 am and 8:32 am a number of telephone calls were made on the landline at the Haberfield house and on the accused's mobile phone. Three of these calls were from the landline to 000, the third one at 8:32 am. The transcript of that phone call was in evidence, as well as a copy of the recording of the call. The accused told the 000 operator that there had been an accident; that there had been a murder inside the house; that Mr Amore had stab wounds; that he believed that he was deceased; that he was inside the house and that he was the only person there. 

16The accused also made a call at 8:28 am from the landline at the Haberfield house to his brother's home, where he spoke to his brother's wife. He seemed out of breath and she asked him what was wrong. He said 'nothing', but told her that he did not know where he was. She asked him if he wanted to speak to his brother and when he said 'yes', she rang her husband. 

17At 8:31 am, Mr Carrado Tarantello, the accused's brother spoke to him. He said that he was driving around. His brother noticed nothing unusual about the accused during this conversation. 

18Constable Dwyer's evidence was that she and the other the police officer who attended with her, found the accused walking down the steps leading to the door of the Haberfield house. His hands and clothes appeared to be covered in blood. When questioned, the accused repeatedly said 'I don't really want to say anything'. He seemed quite calm. 

19Sergeant Crematy's evidence was that when he arrived, the accused was with Constable Dwyer and another officer. He also noticed that the accused had a large amount of blood on his hands and clothing and that he had an injury to his right eye. He entered the house and found Mr Amore's body slumped against the rear wall of the house. Mr Amore had severe injuries to his head and face. He saw a pair of scissors, which appeared to be covered in blood on the kitchen bench, near a cordless phone, which was also covered in blood. The handle of the scissors was broken. The missing handle was lying on the floor. A table was lying on its side, as were chairs. One appeared to be broken and there was a pair of glasses on the floor, which also appeared to have blood on them. 

20When Sergeant Crematy spoke to the accused, he refused to say anything about what had happened. The accused was then arrested. 

21During the recorded interview with the police which occurred later that morning, the accused repeatedly responded to Sergeant Crematy's questions, and those asked by others, by saying that he could not remember things which had happened; that he did not want to answer questions; and that he did not want to discuss the matters raised with him. He said that he wanted to speak to his mother and brother and that he did not want to discuss how he had found Mr Amore because: 

""A 'Cause I, I, I'm scared if something happens to me and maybe I did something, which maybe I didn't, I'm not too sure. I don't want to be accused for something that I didn't do or maybe I wasn't in fault, or maybe I was fault, I don't know, or maybe I do know. I'm not saying. I just, all I'm saying is, is I need time to think things through and, 'cause I'm a little bit distressed."" 

22Forensic samples were taken from the accused as well as from Mr Amore's body. Mr Amore's death certificate, as well as an autopsy report and a neuropathology report prepared by Dr Kendall Bailey were in evidence. Dr Bailey concluded that the cause of Mr Amore's death was multiple stab wounds to the head and neck. He had multiple penetrating wounds to his head, eye, cheeks and neck, including one which penetrated his jugular, as well as wounds to his chest and abdomen and to his hands. Many of the wounds were in pairs, of varying distance apart. Some of the wounds had entered the cranial and abdominal cavities. Some of the wounds to the head and torso appeared to have been inflicted post mortem. 

23A forensic report prepared by Detective Sergeant Agius was also in evidence. He had examined the clothing which the accused had worn, which had been seized from him shortly after his arrest. Detective Sergeant Agius concluded that the primary contributing source of the blood found on that clothing was Mr Amore; that before those stains were made there were no bloodstains present on the accused's clothes and that the wearer of the clothes would have been in close proximity to Mr Amore, when he was attacked, with the most likely causes of the blood being transferred to the clothes by contact with blood stained items, or a person. 

24Also in evidence was a certificate of analysis under s 177 of the Evidence Act 1995 of Virginia Freedman of samples obtained from the blades of the pair of scissors, which were found to contain a mixture of DNA profiles that originated from two individuals. Upon comparison with relevant control samples, Ms Freedman concluded that it was 72 million times more likely to obtain that mixed profile, if the DNA had originated from Mr Amore and the accused, than from Mr Amore and an unknown unrelated individual. DNA profiles were also produced from samples obtained from the fingernail clippings of the right hand of the accused. Ms Freedman concluded that this DNA material was also from two male contributors. The accused could not be excluded as one of those contributors. Assuming that the accused was one of those contributors, the DNA profile of the second contributor was determined, with the result that the DNA profile of Mr Amore could not be excluded as that second contributor. The expected occurrence of the DNA profile of that second contributor occurring in the general population, is fewer than one in 10 billion individuals. 

The psychiatric evidence 

25Reports of the treating psychiatrist Dr Roxanas, the treating psychologist Dr Pollicina, as well as reports of the forensic psychiatrists Professor Greenberg and Dr Nielssen, who had both conducted psychiatric assessments of the accused, were in evidence. All of their reports confirmed that the accused was suffering from a serious mental illness at the time of Mr Amore's death. None of the doctors were required for cross examination. 

26It is convenient to first refer to the most recent report. It was the Crown which led evidence from Professor Greenberg. In his May 2011 report, Professor Greenberg's diagnosis was that the accused suffers from a chronic schizophrenic disorder with treatment-resistant residual symptoms. He then assessed that the accused understood the nature of the charge which he faces. While the accused had told Professor Greenberg that he intended to plead not guilty by reason of mental illness, in the Professor's opinion the accused did not understand the consequences of such a plea, even though he did understand the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The Professor was of the view that the accused was not then able to explain the purpose of these proceedings; he would have difficulty appreciating the substantial effect of evidence; in giving instructions to his legal counsel; or in deciding what defence he should make. The accused could not give a version of the facts and if required to give evidence, could not do so. On the balance of probability, he remained unfit to stand trial. 

27Professor Greenberg noted that the accused remained unable to give any account of his version of events, at the time of the alleged offence. Given his history of severe mental illness in the two to three years prior to the alleged offence, the Professor was of the view that on the balance of probabilities, the accused's mental illness played a significant and major role in his behaviour at the time, with the result that he was likely to have a defence of mental illness. 

28In his March 2010 report, Professor Greenberg also noted that the accused was then unable to remember the events of 13 May 2009; whether he was then using illicit drugs or alcohol; or taking psychiatric medication. He was also unsure if he was then experiencing hallucinations or paranoid or somatic beliefs. When asked if he had murdered his stepfather, he said that his mind was blank. The accused was vague about his history since diagnosis some 15 years ago, with schizophrenia. He was uncertain as to whether he suffered from a mental illness and was unsure why he took medication. He reported no conflict with his stepfather. He did not answer most questions asked and most frequently replied 'I don't know', when he did answer. Professor Greenberg found the accused's insight into his mental illness then to be grossly impaired. 

29Professor Greenberg referred to the accused's medical history, including a 2008 report to his GP, Dr West by his treating psychiatrist Dr Roxanas, in relation to his diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic delusions that people were following him and trying to harm him; his past substance abuse, which was not ongoing; and his pre-occupation with delusions about his mother and brother. There was a history in 2008 of delusional beliefs about his brother's influence on his life, despite psychiatric medication, as well as preoccupation with people entering his house suspiciously and moving items around his house. It was noted that in 2008 and 2009 a psychologist had noted strained relations with his brother and stepfather. Professor Greenberg's opinion was that the accused's condition had been deteriorating since 2006, with the result that he had come before the court on various criminal charges. 

30Professor Greenberg also noted the treatment which the accused had received in custody, but observed that the accused's cognitive functioning remained impaired, as was his general ability to interact and communicate with people. There had to that point, in his view, been a further deterioration in the accused's chronic illness. 

31In his March 2011 report, Dr Nielssen n oted that he observed the accused pacing the ward, not interacting with other patients, suffering from a tremor and involuntary movements which were the side effects of potent anti-psychotic medication which he was taking. I interpose to note from my observation of the accused in Court, he visibly continues to suffer those symptoms. 

32The accused gave Dr Nielssen brief and uninformative answers to open ended questions. He knew that he had been found unfit for trial and that a plea of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness would be entered. He could not remember stabbing Mr Amore, whether he had a pair of scissors that might have been used in the attack, or whether he had any reason to kill him. The accused asked Dr Nielssen for advice in response to several questions, his expression was observed to be blunted; and his answers markedly impoverished and required prompting, to provide even basic information. 

33Dr Nielssen spoke to the accused's treating doctor, who had observed some more lucid moments, but the accused's impairment was considered to be consistent with severe schizophrenia. There was no evidence that the accused was exaggerating or feigning the extent of his intellectual impairment. Dr Nielssen's diagnosis was that the accused was suffering from severe treatment resistant schizophrenia, with significant impairment in all areas of his intellectual function. 

34Despite the absence of clear explanation of the relationship between the symptoms of his illness and his behaviour, Dr Nielssen was of the view that the defence of mental illness was open to the accused. He concluded: 

""However, despite the absence of a clear explanation of the relationship between symptoms of mental illness and his behaviour, I believe Mr Tarantello has the defence of mental illness open to him. He has a severe form of schizophrenic illness which in its more severe forms is a progressive neuro-degenerative disorder. Schizophrenia produces a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. Mr Tarantello's mental illness gave rise to a defect of reason that is most evident in his poverty of thought and impairment in a range of domains of intellectual function including the registration and retrieval of information and his capacity for abstract and logical thinking. Mr Tarantello also has the well-documented chronic delusional beliefs that his health had been tampered with, that people had broken into his home, that people used telepathy from the eyes to send him messages and that his actions were controlled by external forces. Those beliefs were chronic in nature and unresponsive to treatment with conventional anti-psychotic medication, and were almost certainly present at the time he attacked his stepfather. In the absence of any rational motive for the attack, I believe that on the balance or probabilities, Mr Tarantello was acting on the basis of his bizarre delusional beliefs. The severe impairment in his capacity for logical thinking arising from his illness deprived him of the ability to consider that his beliefs were delusional, or to understand that his actions in killing his stepfather in response to those beliefs was morally wrong. 

Unless there is significant improvement in his condition, Mr Tarantello will require indefinite treatment in a secure hospital. 

35In his January 2010 report, Dr Nielssen had noted changes in the accused's treatment, since his August 2009 report. He then diagnosed chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia. There had in his view been no improvement in the accused's condition, to the contrary Dr Nielssen was then of the view that there had been a deterioration since he had last seen the accused, which might have reflected a reduction in the effective dose of medication which the accused was receiving. The accused had declined some alterations proposed in his treatment. 

36Dr Nielssen was also then of the view that the accused was unfit for trial and that his under treated mental illness would prevent him from following any proceedings in a meaningful way; understanding legal advice; or providing reliable instructions to his legal representatives. Dr Nielssen then believed that with treatment in hospital, there was a reasonable chance that the accused's mental state would improve within 12 months, so that he might then be fit for trial. I note that this hope has not materialised. 

37In his August 2009 report, Dr Nielssen noted that he had twice interviewed the accused, the second time after the accused had been given legal advice as to the purpose of the interview and the need for a written report as to his condition to be prepared. Still his answers were very vague and in some places seemed evasive. He often answered 'I don't remember', but confirmed previous convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1988; serving three and a half years for armed robbery and two convictions for indecent exposure. There was also a conviction for cultivating cannabis, but the accused was evasive in his responses about past substance abuse. He denied smoking cannabis. 

38When asked about the alleged offence, the accused confirmed where the events occurred, but could not remember details. He did recall an incident four years previously, where his stepfather had hit him, but denied having held any grievance from that incident, or having any reason to dislike his stepfather. 

39When referred to symptoms described in Dr Roxanas' report, the accused agreed that he believed that his stepfather had used telepathy to affect his health, and that an argument with his stepfather had followed, after he had accused him of doing so. He also agreed that he believed that other people had forced him to expose himself and that his sexual organs had been damaged, but denied believing that people were breaking into his house. When asked how he intended to plead to the charges, he said that 'I don't know what to say', but when asked if he would prefer to plead not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, he said 'possibly, ... I would prefer it'. 

40Dr Nielssen noted Dr Roxanas' report of the accused's long history of non compliance with treatment and ongoing delusional beliefs. Dr Nielssen noted that the accused was made a forensic patient, because of initial refusal to take medication. He had refused food and drink because of concerns about its content and believed that other inmates planned him harm. Hallucinations and a belief that he was not mentally ill were also noted. Dr Nielssen then diagnosed chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia, because the accused continued to experience symptoms, despite receiving adequate doses of antipsychotic medication given in reliable form of long acting injections. Dr Nielssen was of the view that his history of convictions reflected a deterioration in his mental illness, with a direct connection between his symptoms and a recent serious assault offence. 

41On the balance of probabilities, Dr Nielssen was then of the view that the accused had a defence of mental illness. He did not recognise the symptoms of his illness and was unable to recognise that any action on the basis of his delusional beliefs would be directed against an innocent person and would be morally wrong. During the acute phases of his illness he was also affected by irrational anger, probably in response to his illness and he was unable to reason with any measure of composure, about the likely consequences of his actions. 

42A report from Dr Roxanas of February 2009, prepared in relation to other proceedings, was also in evidence. Dr Roxanas referred to an 18 year history of delusions and hallucinations preceded by the use of LSD and cannabis. The doctor referred to complaints that the accused's life and the world appeared to be a dream and that some of his exhibitionist behaviour had been related to a phenomena of 'passivity feelings', where he was instructed by outside forces to perform those acts'. In September 2008, Dr Roxanas had seen the accused in relation to 'telepathically inflicted pain'. 

43Dr Roxanas noted a long history of non-compliance with treatment, but with improvement after fortnightly injections and daily oral medication were introduced. The doctor then assessed that the accused was unlikely to improve with hospital admission, but that he did not then present as a danger to himself or others. Community treatment was assessed to be appropriate. It was noted that he had been compliant with appointments and treatment. 

44In 2009 the accused had been referred to a psychologist, Dr Pollicina, for counselling. On 4 May 2009, Dr Pollicina reported that the accused had completed a course of 12 counselling sessions, but that further counselling was recommended, because of the chronic nature of the accused's condition. Dr Pollicina was of the view that a chemical imbalance was causing the accused's symptoms, which may have originally been drug induced and that the early loss of his father and his social isolation had added to his negative state. From March 2009, Dr Pollicina observed the accused's state to have been variously 'flat' or depressed. The last session took place on 1 May, with the accused then expressing a desire to continue counselling, in the long term. 

The issues 

45There is no question between the parties as to the issues which arise for determination. It is the Crown who must prove the elements of the murder charge brought against the accused, beyond reasonable doubt. In this case the elements of the offence charged are that:- 

(1) Frank Amore died. 

(2) His death was caused by the acts of the accused, by repeated stabbing. 

(3) At the time of committing those acts, the accused intended either to kill Frank Amore, or at least to cause him grievous bodily harm. 

46The accused did not give evidence. He has the benefit of the presumption of innocence. His silence is not evidence against him; nor does it constitute any sort of admission by him. Nor may his silence be used to fill any gaps in the evidence tendered by the prosecution (see Azzopardi v R [2001] HCA 25; (2001) 205 CLR 50 per Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [67]). Even so, in this case there was no issue between the parties as to the proof of the elements of the offence with which the accused has been charged. 

47Ms Manuell, on behalf of the accused, contended that the accused had a defence of mental illness, with the result that I should return the special verdict provided by s 38 of the Act, that he is not guilty by reason of mental illness. That is, that at the time of doing the acts which caused Mr Amore's death, the accused was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible in law for his acts. 

48The other issue which must thus be determined in this case is whether or not the evidence establishes that the accused has available to him the defence of mental illness. The onus of proof of that defence falls on the accused on the balance of probabilities (see Mizzi v R [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659). On the evidence the Crown conceded that I would find that the defence has been established and would enter the verdict and make the orders which Ms Manuell proposed on behalf of the accused. 

49Despite the concessions which the parties have each made, it is a matter for the judge hearing the charge to determine, on the evidence, that the Crown has met the onus which falls on it and that the accused has established the defence relied on, before the verdict which the parties both submit should be reached in this case, may be entered. 

The offence charged is proven 

50The evidence relied on by the Crown to meet the onus which falls upon it is circumstantial. There was no submission put for the accused that this evidence had not satisfied the onus which falls on the Crown. To the contrary, it was accepted that the onus had been met. 

51Every man and woman is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason, to be responsible for his or her crimes, until the contrary is proven. The question of mental illness arises to be considered in relation to the defence of mental illness. As observed in R v Stiles (1990) 50 A Crim R 13: 

""The proper approach is not circular but linear. The jury in the first place must consider whether the offence is proved. If it is not, the accused should be acquitted, not found not guilty on the ground of insanity. An accused must not lose a chance of acquittal of the offence charged by reason of being insane. In considering whether the offence has been proved, the jury must in the first place act upon the presumption that the accused was of sound mind. The question of insanity only arises if the jury, assuming the accused was of sound mind, would find the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182 at 185[PDF] per Dixon J (as then he was) and Perkins [1983] WAR 184 at 188 per Burt CJ (a decision upon the Criminal Code (WA) but stating relevant principle)."" 

52My consideration of the evidence has led me to the view that I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was the acts of the accused in repeatedly stabbing Mr Amore that caused his death and that at the time, the accused had the requisite intention of killing or causing him grievous bodily harm. 

53These findings followed inevitably from the evidence as to the nature of the very many serious wounds inflicted on Mr Amore and the circumstances of his death, in the light of how his death was made known by the accused to the authorities. 

54It was the accused who made Mr Amore's death swiftly known, not very long after his mother had left him in Mr Amore's company, when they dropped her off at the bus stop. The inference from the evidence is that the accused and Mr Amore then drove together back to the house at Haberfield, where the accused's car was parked. He there stabbed Mr Amore repeatedly with a pair of scissors. 

55Mr Amore's car was found parked at the Haberfield house in the driveway, when police responded to the accused's 000 call. That the accused was not out driving while Mr Amore was killed, or shortly afterwards, when he spoke to his brother, as he then told his brother, was confirmed by the 000 call which the accused made moments later from the Haberfield house. That is further confirmed by the fact that when the police arrived, the accused's car was parked outside the house in the street. The keys to the car were later found under Mr Amore's body. 

56The accused rang 000 three times. Twice before he spoke to his brother, but the calls were not connected. When the accused rang 000 shortly after he spoke to his brother, he told the operator that Mr Amore had been murdered. He has never confessed that he was the murderer, having always been unable or unwilling to speak about what happened that day. He was, however, found by police, alone at the Haberfield house, as he had told the 000 operator, with Mr Amore's body, shortly after his death. 

57The forensic evidence also suggests that the accused was present when Mr Amore was killed, with the result that he was covered with his blood, when he stabbed Mr Amore repeatedly. That the scissors were the weapon used to inflict the many stab wounds which caused Mr Amore's death, is apparent. That both Mr Amore and the accused's DNA were found on the scissors, which were left on the kitchen bench near a phone, also covered in blood, provides further support for that conclusion that it was the accused who used the scissors to inflict the wounds which caused Mr Amore's death. 

58This conclusion is also supported by the evidence that some of the injuries which Mr Amore suffered were consistent with him having sought to defend himself from the attack. The state of the room in which Mr Amore's body was found was consistent with there having been an altercation between them, as was the injury to the accused's eye, observed when he was arrested, as well as the DNA evidence to which I have referred. 

59On the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all elements of the offence charged have been proven. Accordingly, I find that Mr Amore's death was caused by the fatal stab wounds which the accused inflicted on him on 13 May 2009. 

The applicable law in relation to the defence of mental illness 

60The defence of mental illness relied on requires proof that at the time that the accused killed Mr Amore, he was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, that he did not know the quality and nature of the physical acts which he was doing, or alternatively that if he did know, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong (see R v M'Naghten (1843) 10 Cl & F 200 [8 ER 718]; R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182). 'Mental illness' is not defined in the Act. 

61In R v Porter at p189 - 90, Dixon J of the High Court explained that the accused must prove that the disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind from which he was suffering, whether arising from some infirmity, temporary or of long standing, was of such a character that he was not able to appreciate the wrongness of what he was doing. His Honour explained what the accused must show at p189 - 90, observing: 
""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people."" 

The defence is established 

62In this case both the accused and the Crown submitted that the defence relied on had been established on the evidence. I accept those submissions. On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the defence was made out. 

63The disease of the mind from which the accused suffers has been now diagnosed as severe treatment resistant schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a mental illness from which the accused had been suffering for many years. The accused's illness has deteriorated over time, despite the accused receiving ongoing treatment. At the time of Mr Amore's death it had become a form of chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia. That illness has continued to deteriorate, despite the accused receiving further treatment since his arrest. 

64The psychiatric evidence which I have outlined all points overwhelmingly and unanimously to the conclusion I have reached. I am satisfied that whilst the accused knew the quality and the nature of his acts, which brought about the death of Mr Amore in May 2009, that at the time he was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. 

Verdict 

65I find the accused to be not guilty of the murder of Frank Amore on the ground of mental illness. 

The consequences of orders under s 39 of the Act 

66The legal and practical consequences of a finding that the accused is ""not guilty on the ground of mental illness"" may be shortly explained (as discussed by Hall J in Regina v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177 at [68] - [79]. Section s 39(1) of the Act requires me to consider making an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit, until released by due process of law. In practice this means that the accused will remain in custody until a decision is made to release him. Until then, he remains under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

67That Tribunal consists of a president and his/her deputy, who must be a lawyer, together with two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist. The third member is a person who has suitable qualifications, or experience for the task. The Tribunal must review the accused's case, as soon as practicable after an order is made by the Court for his detention in strict custody. It may then make orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment, or as to his release. 

68The Tribunal may not make an order for the release of the accused, unless satisfied, amongst other things, that the safety of the patient or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the patient's release. The Minister for Health and the Attorney-General may appear before the Tribunal, or make submissions to the Tribunal, in relation to the possible release of the accused. 

69Where an order for release of the accused is not made, the Tribunal's orders will result in the accused's continued detention, care and treatment, in a place and manner which it specifies. After the Tribunal's initial review, it must, at least once every six months, again review his case and must then make further orders as to the accused's continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place, or as to his release. 

70If the Tribunal makes an order that the accused be released, that order may be made on conditions, or release may be ordered unconditionally. If any condition imposed by the Tribunal is breached by the accused, or if the mental condition of the accused deteriorates after release, so that he may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the Tribunal for his apprehension, care and detention. 

71The conditions of release which could be prescribed by the Tribunal include matters such as living in a particular place; taking particular medication; keeping appointments with health care professionals; and enrolment in educational and therapeutic programmes, to ensure that the accused is properly cared for. 

72Other than pursuant to any such order for the accused's release in future by the Tribunal, the result of an order made by the Court under s 39 is the accused will remain in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions which cares for forensic patients in this State. Security conditions, as necessary, are in place while the accused is detained in a hospital, prison or other place, or if he is allowed to be temporarily absent from the place of detention. The accused may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release, or where released on conditions and those conditions have expired over time. 

73However, as I have explained, the accused will only ever be released if the Tribunal is satisfied on evidence available to it in future, that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered. 

Orders 

74For the reasons which I have given, I order that: 

1. Giuseppe Tarantello, upon the charge that on 13 May 2009 at Haberfield in the State of New South Wales you did murder Frank Amore, pursuant to the provisions of s 22(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I find that you are not guilty by reason of mental illness. 

2. Pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, that Giuseppe Tarantello be detained, in an appropriate correctional centre, or such facility or other place as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine, until released by due process of law. 

3. Pursuant to s 39(3) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 the Registrar notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by this Court and to provide the Tribunal with copies of the psychiatric reports in evidence in these proceedings. 

75Finally, I take the opportunity of extending my deepest sympathy to all members of Mr Amore's extended family, who have all undoubtedly been deeply affected by his very tragic death. That his death was so regrettably the result of the actions of a member of his own family, a person who has had such a long and deteriorating mental condition must not go without notice. My particular sympathy is extended to Mr Amore's partner and the accused's mother, given the unquestionable grief which she must have suffered, as the cruel result of the events which I have had to deal with in these proceedings. Mr Amore's children are also greatly to be pitied for their loss and the grief that the circumstances have unquestionably caused them. I hope that what has been dealt with in these proceedings will provide them all with some small comfort in understanding what has come to pass and how it has been dealt with by our society.

		04 November 2011",2011-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2756947,Queanbeyan City Council v Environment Protection Authority [2011] NSWCCA 108,"Judgment  1WHEALY JA:  This is an application for leave to appeal under section 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from an interlocutory judgment in Class 5 of the Land and Environment Court's jurisdiction.  Queanbeyan City Council (the applicant) had been charged with an offence of polluting waters in contravention of section 120(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (""the Act"").  The Council pleaded not guilty to the charge.  2By Notice of Motion filed on 22 nd July 2009, the applicant sought a permanent stay of the prosecution, on the basis that the proceedings were an abuse of process.  The foundation for the stay application was an assertion that the conduct of the prosecutor, the Environment Protection Authority (""EPA""), in not issuing an Environment Protection Licence under the Act, had deprived the applicant of the opportunity to avail itself of the only statutory defence to the charge.  3The stay application was heard over a number of days in August 2009.  Pepper J (the primary judge) reserved her decision and, on 21 st December 2010, refused to grant the permanent stay.  Her Honour determined that the prosecution, if permitted to continue, would not result in unfairness.  Moreover, her Honour determined that the public interest lay in the trial proceeding.  Not only did the facts and circumstances in the application not warrant the cessation of the proceedings, her Honour said, rather, in her opinion they mandated the continuance of the trial.  Grounds of appeal  4The Notice of Appeal and Application for Leave to Appeal were filed on 4 th February 2011.  The grounds of appeal were originally some five in number, although, in more recent times, permission has been sought to add a new ground.  The grounds may be summarised as follows:  1) A denial of natural justice;  2) Error of statutory construction;  3) Error in identification of proper legal test for permanent stay;  4) Misuse of evidence;  5) Costs ordered in the absence of power; and  6) A new ground: findings were made that were not supported by the    evidence.  The particulars of these grounds are extensive, but their details are comprehensively set out in the document attached to the Notice of Appeal.  Background  5As I have said, the applicant was charged with a strict liability offence of polluting waters, in contravention of section 120 of the Act.  The Council operated a sewerage treatment system.  The actual sewage treatment plant itself (being the principal part of the system) was located at Oak's Estate in the Australian Capital Territory.  There were, however, a number of associated reticulation and pumping stations in Queanbeyan.  6There had been in the past a number of incidents of overflow of sewage at the Morissett Street Sewage Pumping Station in Queanbeyan.  The EPA issued a series of statutory prevention notices requiring the council to review the operation of this point of the sewerage system, which was apparently old and in somewhat poor condition.  These notices required the construction of an underground retention system at an appropriate location identified by the council, and the preparation of a maintenance and inspection plan to reduce effluent surcharges.  In compliance, the Council designed, constructed and installed the Wanniassa Street Overflow Outlet as an augmentation to the pumping station.  7The Council did not apply for an Environmental Protection Licence, in respect of either the pumping station or the outlet.  However, all sewerage at the pumping station went to the treatment plant in the ACT.  This treatment plant at all material times had been subject to a licence issued by the ACT.  8As has been mentioned earlier, the absence of a licence for the NSW pumping station, and indeed for the New South Wales reticulation system, was to become an important matter in relation to the stay application.  The EPA had indicated that it would not have issued any such licence.  It has maintained, throughout these proceedings, that the legislation simply did not enable the issue of such a licence to the applicant.  9On 4 th and 5 th November 2007, there were two overflow incidents, the second of which resulted in the discharge of some 1.5 million litres of untreated sewage into the Queanbeyan River.  The prosecution case is that this was caused by a pump and alarm failure at the pumping station.  The alarm had been designed to notify the Council if one of the pumps at the pumping station had failed, but as I have said, the Council case is that it also failed to operate.  10After the first incident on 4 th November 2007, the Council, it is alleged, was aware that the alarm system had not operated properly.  It was not until council employees arrived for work on 5 th November, however, that the second pump failure was discovered.  Twelve hours had elapsed between the failure of the pump, and its reactivation, the delay resulting in the enormous spillage of sewage that has been identified.  11Although there were two pollution incidents, the Council was charged with water pollution only in respect of the second pollution, the incident occurring on 5 th November 2007.  12It may b helpful, however, to briefly set out the following matter of detail which I take from an affidavit in the proceedings sworn by Darren Laws.:-  9.  About 2004 QCC installed an underground sewerage holding system consisting of 5 X 1800 millimetre storm pipes, 12 X 75 millimetre, all connected to an overflow pit with surface grate between Morissett and Wanniassa Streets, Queanbeyan.  10.  The overflow pit within this system is located within Wanniassa Street Park approximately 10 metres from the Queanbeyan River.  There is no other sewage overflow outlet for the Morissett Street SPS.  ...  12.  The Wanniassa Street overflow pit is directly connected to the Morissett Street SPS.  I estimate that the sewerage holding pipes and overflow pit is able to hold approximately 1 - 2 mega litres of untreated sewage.  13.  The purpose of the sewerage holding system and overflow pit is to store untreated sewage.  14.  In the event that the Morissett Street SPS pumps fail to activate, the Wanniassa Street Sewerage holding system is designed to store untreated sewage for a limited time before the holding pipe system and the overflow pit fills to capacity.  15.  When capacity is exceeded, the untreated sewage will overflow from the Wanniassa Street Park overflow outlet and run directly into the Queanbeyan River.  These facts, of course, are derived from prosecution material and are intended to do no more than flesh out the nature of the prosecution case.  The affidavit was admitted into evidence on a limited basis, namely to expose and explain matters relevant to the discretion to prosecute.  The stay application  13I turn now to consider the stay application.  The case sought to be made by the applicant before the primary judge may be best seen by the introductory submission in its written outline of submissions filed on 24 th August 2009.  It states:-  The defendant seeks a permanent stay of the prosecution because it is an abuse of process, for the following reasons:  2.1 The defendant has been deprived by the conduct of the prosecutor of the opportunity to avail itself of the statutory defence provided to the charge set out in section 122 of the Act because:  (a) The prosecutor determined that the sewerage reticulation system operated by the defendant in New South Wales did not, and does not, require an Environmental Protection licence under the Act;  (b) The prosecutor represented to the defendant that its sewerage reticulation system in New South Wales did not require an Environment Protection Licence under the Act;  (c) The prosecutor did not issue an Environment Protection Licence for the sewage reticulation system, or any part of it, operated by the defendant in New South Wales.  2.2 It is a misuse of this court's process for the prosecutor to bring these proceedings against the defendant alleging pollution of the Queanbeyan River from the overflow structure in circumstances when:  (a) The overflow structure was designed to release storm water and untreated sewage into the Queanbeyan River; and  (b) The prosecutor approved the design, location and installation of the overflow structure; and  (c) And directed the defendant, pursuant to its powers under section 96 of the Act to construct the overflow structure, under the threat of criminal prosecution, if it did not do so.  14The EPA response to these submissions was, first, that the respective failure of both the pump and alarm systems had been the cause of the major overflow of untreated sewage into the adjacent area and the Queanbeyan River.  This, and the delay in repumping, were said to be important reasons why the prosecution was instituted.  15Secondly, the Section 96 Notices issued by the EPA, and the consequent overflow works, had no factual connection to the circumstances involved in the failure of the systems responsible for the overflow.  Indeed, nothing in the Notices would have caused the applicant to have relied on them as a cause for its failure to properly monitor its pumps, knowing its telemetry was inoperative.  16Thirdly, and most significantly, the fundamental basis of the stay application was misconceived.  This was because neither EPA policy nor the surrounding circumstances would ever have permitted a licence, if issued, to contain a condition which would have permitted or excused the extensive pollution, which were the subject of the proceedings.  17Fourthly, in regard to this contention, the dealings between the parties did not amount to a representation and the council did not rely on it as such.  18In the context of these propositions, I should mention that section 122 of the Act, which is at the core of the applicant's abuse of process argument, provides a defence where an environment protection licence is held, but only where the conditions to which the licence were subject were not contravened.  19I turn now to the primary judge's decision.  In short, her Honour stated that the council's motion, in the exercise of her discretion, should be refused upon three bases.  First, the primary judge said, the submission put by the council that the Morissett Street Sewage Pumping Station was required to be licensed was not correct.  20Secondly, even if a license should have been issued, the unfairness about which the council complained simply did not exist.  This was because, both as the evidence and the Act showed, no conditions attached to any license issued would have permitted the second overflow incident the subject of the charge.  21In other words, I understood her Honour to be saying that the extremely large overflow of untreated sewage that occurred on the 5 th November could never have been sanctioned by the terms of any conditions, or purported compliance with those conditions.  22Thirdly, her Honour posited that, in the light of the council's history of sewage overflows, with their attendant risk of harm to the environment and to human safety, the public interest in permitting the prosecution to proceed clearly outweighed any unfairness alleged to have been created by the absence of the licence.  23Each of these findings was examined in considerable detail by her Honour, and supported by a careful analysis of the material before her.  Leave is required  24Section 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act requires the applicant to obtain leave to appeal against an interlocutory order of judgment.  There is no dispute that the order made by her Honour answers that description.  The principles under which leave is granted are not in dispute.  They are regularly applied in this court.  25First, leave should not readily be granted unless an appropriate case is made out, showing an error of principle apt to cause irregularity or injustice ( R v Van Phu Ho (Unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 th July 1994, Gleeson CJ, Mahoney JA, Dunford J)).  26Secondly, where the order involves the exercise of a discretion, as is the case here, the usual restraint and limitation placed upon an appellate court's intervention will apply ( House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 - 504).  27Thirdly, it has been held that leave will only be granted where the decision which is the subject of the application is attended with sufficient doubt so as to warrant the matter being argued on appeal ( R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 644 - 645) or where the interests of justice otherwise require the intervention of the court at this stage of the proceedings ( R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 723.  See also R v Dinh [2000] NSWCCA 536 at [34]; R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31).  28In the circumstances of the present application, there are two further principles that require consideration.  The essence of the applicant's submission here is that the proceedings should be stayed on the basis of unfairness.  In that regard, the applicant, who carries the onus, must demonstrate not merely a perception of unfairness, but actual unfairness that is incapable of correction ( R v Ulman-Narumiec [2003) 143 A Crim R 531 at [24] and [70] - [72]).  29Secondly, it is necessary to keep in mind that a permanent stay of criminal proceedings represents an exceptional remedy.  It is exercisable only in extreme and exceptional cases ( Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 34 per Mason CJ, at 76 per Gaudron J).  In that regard, in Dupas v R (2010) 241 CLR 237, the High Court quoted with approval R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605 - 606:  A permanent stay will only be ordered in an extreme case and there must be a fundamental defect ""of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences"".  Resolution  30For my part, I have reached the firm conclusion that this is a matter in respect of which the court should not grant leave.  It is clear, from the primary judge's carefully reasoned decision, that she was not satisfied that the unfairness alleged by the applicant had been established.  On this central point, her Honour's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the matter being argued on appeal.  31As I read the decision, there were essentially three reasons that underpinned the conclusion reached by the Pepper J.  First, the applicant could not demonstrate that a licence must have been issued for the pumping station and its augmentation system.  32Secondly, if contrary to this finding, a licence had been issued, it would not have provided a defence for the present prosecution involving, as the incident did, a massive eruption of untreated sewage.  Thirdly, the second ""overflow"" was not causally related to the work carried out by the council as a consequence of the EPA's prevention notices.  Fourthly, her Honour found that no representation as alleged had either been made or relied upon.  The limited evidence of Mr Chapman (to which I have earlier made reference) could not have amounted to a representation that would support the central argument advanced by the applicant.  33True it is that Mr Chapman gave oral evidence on the subject, as mentioned during submissions this morning by senior counsel for the applicant, but her Honour was not bound to accept that evidence, and indeed, it is clear, she was not persuaded by it.  34In relation to the disciplinary aspect of her Honour's decision, no error has been demonstrated.  In my opinion, her Honour took into account all relevant matters, and did not overlook any matter of relevance.  The ultimate decision, based as it was on the public interest in maintaining a prosecution of a significant kind, was well within her Honour's discretion.  In addition, I have concluded that none of the matters alleged to be errors in the primary judge's decision warrant the grant of leave.  I shall deal with each of these separately.  I accept, as senior counsel for the applicant argued, that her Honour effectively examined need for a licence by reference to the Morisset Street Pumping Station, rather than by reference to the New South Wales reticulation system.  Her Honour gave a number of reasons for this basis of examination.  35In this regard, the first conclusion reached by her Honour was favourable to the council.  This was that the pumping system, indeed, fell within the definition of ""sewage treatment systems"" in the Schedule to the Act.  However, the EPA had unsuccessfully argued that it did not.  Notwithstanding this finding, her Honour thought that the capacity of the pumping station rendered it ineligible to be separately licensed.  That aspect of her Honour's decision was criticised because a calculation of the capacity of the entire New South Wales reticulation system would have yielded a much greater and different result.  While there is force in this submission, the remaining reasons advanced by her Honour as to why a licence was not required were plainly applicable however, not only to the Morisset Street pumping station, but to the New South Wales system as a whole.  Indeed, these were the principal reasons, as I read the decision, that supported the primary judge's conclusions on this point.  It could not therefore be said, despite the forceful arguments put by senior counsel for the applicant, that her Honour did not deal with the case advanced by the applicant.  36Secondly, I am not persuaded that her Honour's construction of the relevant legislation, both in Chapter 3 of the Act and Schedule 1, was other than broadly correct and was indeed appropriate to the circumstances of the argument presented before her.  There may well have an arguable case relating to the first conclusion I have set out above but this aspect of the decision was, as I have said, favourable to the applicant.  37Thirdly, the argument relating to the legal test for a permanent stay does not, in my opinion, raise a question of principle and in any event the test is settled and well established, as her Honour noted in her decision.  38Fourthly, the evidence which was admitted for a limited purpose, was relied upon by the primary judge in an appropriate manner.  Mr McIlwaine argued that certain evidence had been admitted on a limited basis under section 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 but that, despite this limitation, her Honour had in fact made factual findings beyond that permitted by the limitation.  The evidence in question, including in particular that concerning the circumstances leading to the second overflow on the evening of 4 th November 2007, was said to have been admitted only on the basis that it was evidence of matters that the EPA had were entitled to have regard to in exercising its prosecutorial discretion in deciding whether to charge the council in respect of the second pollution incident.  39I do not, with all due respect, consider that there is any validity in this complaint made by Mr McIlwaine.  There is no dispute that the evidence referred to in the written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant, and about which complaint is made, was admitted for the purpose stated.  I do not consider that the findings made contravene this limitation.  40Particular attention was drawn to paragraph [155] of the judgment in which her Honour referred to the fact that the pollution was caused not by a failure of the structures but by the failure of the pump at the Morisset Street pumping station, combined with the failure of the council to provide a timely response to the stoppage.  When considered in context, however, it is clear that her Honour was doing no more than evaluating the material available to the prosecutor which, on the assumption that the evidence were accepted, indicated that the cause of the failure in the system was as stated by her Honour.  That was a significant matter underpinning the decision to prosecute.  I do not consider that the finding made in this respect was one that went beyond the scope of the limitation under section 136.  It is necessary to read the primary judge's decision fairly, and when read in that way, this seems to me to be the inevitable consequence.  41Fifthly, the argument concerning the power to award costs is of itself not sufficient to warrant the grant of leave. It can have no real connection to the corrections or otherwise of the decision on the stay application.  However, Mr Glissan QC has indicated his instructions are that, on this limited point, this Court may, if it thinks appropriate, vacate the costs order particularly as it was not the subject of any submissions or debate in the court below.  I consider that the order should be vacated because it was not a matter brought to either partiy's attention before it was made.  As a consequence, neither party had an opportunity to make any submissions concerning the order.  The vacation of the order for costs will enable the court below to consider that issue at some future point of time if it becomes necessary.  I prefer not to express any opinion on the availability of the power to order costs in the present situation.  42Finally, the additional ground (relating to facts that should have been found at first instance) does not commend itself to my mind as a matter warranting the grant of leave.  Her Honour's findings in this regard are clearly set out between paragraphs [151] to [171] of the decision.  These findings, and her Honour's overall analysis of the factual situation, demonstrate the inherent weakness of the representation argument sought to be relied upon by the applicant at first instance.  There was nothing to stop the council, if it wished, from applying for a licence and if refused to appeal the decision to the Land and Environment Court.  More importantly, as her Honour found, the EPA's attitude that it could not issue a licence, or that a licence was not required for the pumping station, simply could not equate to a representation by the EPA that pollution occasioned by a major sewage surcharge would ever be regarded as permissible.  Nor could it amount to a representation that a prosecution would not be mounted if such an event occurred.  Mr Chapman himself acknowledged, as her Honour noted, the EPA had made it ""perfectly clear"" that no licence would be issued that permitted ""an overflow structure which would discharge untreated sewage"".  43Finally, her Honour noted at paragraph [155] that the pollution was caused not by a failure of the underground retention system and earth bund installed as a result of the prevention notices.  It was caused by the failure of the pump at the Morisset Street Pumping Station, combined with the failure of the council to provide a timely response to the stoppage.  This evidence was before her Honour precisely on the point of the prosecutorial discretion.  For that reason, it was available to her to consider on both the unfairness and discretion issues.  It was not of course evidence of the truth of the facts for the purpose of the proposed prosecution.  Mr Glissan QC agreed that this was the case and that the findings are not to be findings in the trial, nor could they be treated as such.  44In these circumstances the factual findings at paragraphs [151] and [153] which are challenged were plainly open to her Honour and there is no sufficient doubt, in my opinion, as to the correctness of those findings.  In these circumstances I would propose the following orders:  (1) The decision below be varied but only to the extent necessary to vacate the order for costs made by Pepper J.  (2)   Otherwise leave to appeal should be refused.  45HALL J:  I also agree that leave should not be granted from the judgment of her Honour Justice Pepper on the stay application.  In the circumstances in which the costs order was made, and having regard to the fair and proper concession by senior counsel for the respondent, I am also of the view that the costs order should be set aside.  I otherwise respectfully agree with the reasons of the presiding judge and the orders that he proposes.  46MCCALLUM J:  I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge for the reasons his Honour has stated.  47WHEALY JA:  The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.  The Court will now adjourn.  **********

		12 May 2011",2011-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2756951,Hanson v Tamworth Regional Council [2011] NSWDC 72,"Judgment 

Introduction 

1These are proceedings for damages for negligence, commenced by way of statement of claim filed on 2 October 2009, which are set down for hearing for 4 days on 1 August 2011. The plaintiffs bring an application to vacate the hearing date, for a second time, in proceedings where the factual background goes back to the 1970s, when the plaintiffs purchased a block of vacant land (""the plaintiffs' land"") in 1976. 

Background 

2The plaintiffs were unaware, when they made their purchase, that this land overlay a natural gully that had been filled with uncontrolled and uncompacted fill, as a result of civil works carried out in 1975, when the subdivision of which the plaintiffs' land was a part was approved by Cockburn Shire Council. As a result, the rear part of the house for which building approval was given in 1976, and which was then built in 1977, began to subside. 

3In 1980 - 1981 the Builders Licensing Board investigated the cause of the damage and determined that the subsidence was due to the construction of the house on uncontrolled fill, with inappropriate footings. Rectification works were carried out in February 1981 and inspected by a council building inspector. 

4Problems continued in 1990, when the council had to inspect and unblock the storm water pipe. In 1998 there was further settlement of the soil, this time at the front of the house. 

5In 2001 the plaintiffs had a meeting with council to discuss this long-standing problem, but it does not appear that anything was resolved. Problems continued until March 2007, when the plaintiffs became aware that leaking water from the storm water pipe was accelerating the settlement of the house. In November 2008 the storm water pipe again became blocked and in 2009 the plaintiffs commenced these proceedings. 

The pleadings and the issue before me today 

6The plaintiffs' pleadings assert that the defendant owed the duty to take all reasonable care as follows: 

a. The council failed to periodically inspect the storm water pipe and its joints, particularly up hill and in front of the plaintiff's land, with the use of CCTV camera or by other appropriate means, to determine whether the pipe joints were broken or open or otherwise allowed the escape of water into the surrounding fill; b. The council failed to remove any debris or other objects in the storm water pipes, which might cause a blockage or reduce its capacity or otherwise allow water to pool in the pipe in the vicinity of the broken or open joints; and/or c. The council failed to maintain and repair the storm water pipe or replace the leaking pipe, so as to prevent water escaping into the surrounding fill, particularly above and in front of the plaintiff's land. 

7The breach of its duty of care from about 1990 is asserted to be: 

a. The council failed to inspect the storm water pipe on a periodic basis or at all; b. The council failed to take any reasonable steps to remove debris and/or other objects in the storm water pipe or any steps at all; and c. The council failed to take any reasonable steps to maintain and/or repair and/or replace the storm water pipe, so as to prevent water escaping into the surrounding fill above and in front of the plaintiff's land, or any steps at all. 

8In addition, it is asserted that the defendant, in breach of its duty of care, has failed to take any reasonable steps or any steps at all of removing debris and/or other objects in the storm water pipe and/or repair the storm water pipe, so as to prevent water escaping into the surrounding fill above and in front of the plaintiffs' land. 

9The defendant's Amended Defence of 27 July 2010 raises the following issues: 

(a) Arguments that s 14 Limitations Act 1969 (NSW) operate as a bar to all causes of action and damage pleaded that occurred prior to 2 October 2003; 

(b) General denials of breach of duty of care and negligence; 

(c) A claim that this is a ""building action"" within the meaning of s 4C Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979; 

(b) Reliance upon ss 42 and 43A Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and reliance upon the proportionate liability provisions of Part 4 of the Act; and 

(e) Alternatively, should the Court find that the claim is not a building action, pursuant to regulation 5(1) Civil Liability Regulations 2009, the proportionate liability provisions of Part 4 apply to any liability arising after 26 July 2004. The concurrent wrongdoers identified for the purposes of the act are MC and YF Benning Builders, CG Civil and Structural Engineers and DT Cohen & Associates. 

10The basis upon which it is asserted that the defendant should have the benefit of s 35 Civil Liability Act are as follows: 

(a) The liability of the defendant should be limited to an amount reflecting that proportion of the damage or loss claimed that the Court considers just having regard to the extent of the defendant's responsibility for the damage of loss; 

(b) Judgment against the defendant should not be for more than that amount whether or not all concurrent wrongdoers are parties to the proceedings; 

(c) The Court should have regard to the comparative responsibility of any concurrent wrongdoer who is not a party to the proceedings. 

11The representatives for both parties, who seek the vacating of the hearing date, both told me that this is complex construction litigation, and that the proceedings were originally set down for hearing on 11 April for 4 days. That hearing was vacated because no judge was available. A second hearing date of 1 August 2011 (again, for 4 days) was accordingly given. 

12The difficulty that the parties say they now have with this date is that problems with the plaintiffs' expert evidence mean that the matter will not be ready to proceed by August. The affidavit of Susan Gai Moran of 6 May 2011 attaches a letter from the plaintiff's expert, saying that the sheer volume of work involved to come to conclusions about this long-running matter make compliance with the timetable impossible. Although the plaintiffs are the moving party on the application, both parties therefore ask me to vacate the hearing date and to reserve the issue of costs. 

13The undesirability of multiple adjournments of any trial have been the subject of recent concern by the NSW Court of Appeal in Lee v Keddie [2011] NSWCA 2 at [7], [10] and [14]. In Lee v Keddie , the defendants (a firm of solicitors) sent a letter about their former employees to the firm's Chinese clients in 2006 claiming they had had to cease employing the plaintiffs for their unethical conduct. A hearing in September 2010 had to be vacated, and a second hearing date was set. The plaintiffs then sought leave to amend their pleading in reply, acknowledging that to do so would lead to an adjournment of the trial. 

14The plaintiffs' application for leave to amend was refused at first instance, and this was affirmed on appeal. The Court of Appeal (at [7]) was particularly drawn to the argument that the matter had been considered to be ready on the two occasions when it was set down for hearing, a factual circumstance identical with the application before me today. The degree of delay by the plaintiffs in Lee which the Court of Appeal considered unacceptable was shorter than the degree of delay in these proceedings, and the factual matrix in Lee , which related to events during and after 2006, was in a much smaller compass than facts in this case, which go back to 1975. In addition, as the court noted, the plaintiffs in Lee had commenced the proceedings promptly, and the defendants would thereby have been on notice from that time as to the factual matrix likely to be covered, whereas the plaintiff did not commence these proceedings until 2009. 

15Lee is one of a series of recent decisions where courts have refused leave to amend (see also Canberra Data Centres Pty Ltd v Vibe Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd (2010) 173 ACTR 33) or adjourn a hearing, by reason of the principles discussed by the High Court in AON Risk Service Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175. However, each case must turn on its own facts. Lee was not a construction case, and was case-managed in a specialist list, and there would no doubt have been other factors which the court took into account in refusing leave to amend and adduce further evidence where the result would be loss of the hearing date. 

16What is important, in terms of doing justice between the parties in accordance with ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act , 2005 (NSW), is that these proceedings be ready for hearing when they are given a third hearing date. In complex matters, where parties are struggling to get on top of a great deal of factual and expert information, a counsel of perfection is of little assistance in achieving a just result. 

17A significant potential problem, in terms of readiness for hearing, is the adequacy of the defendant's pleading of proportionate liability, because it is open to the plaintiffs to join these named concurrent wrongdoers, and the question of whether there should be any pleading by the plaintiffs in reply. If there is any joinder of these parties by the plaintiffs, this has consequences for the defendant as well, because if they are joined, whether the plaintiffs are successful or not, the defendant is at risk as to costs of this joinder (by reason of the provisions of s 35A Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)). 

18Whether the plaintiffs join these parties to the proceedings or not, the desirability of the defendant providing full particulars of the facts and matters for asserting that each of the alleged concurrent wrongdoers is liable, and of the plaintiffs setting out their pleadings in reply, are matters that the parties can now consider, taking into account the additional time they have before the matter is next listed for hearing. 

19The pleading and evidentiary problems parties face in proportionate liability claims in litigation involving allegations of negligence arising from construction problems has been helpfully set out by Justice McDougall in his article ""Proportionate Liability In Construction Litigation"" (2006) 22(6) BCL 394 . I have provided a copy of this article to the parties and drawn their attention to the sections concerning onus of proof, multiple parties and pleading issues. In particular, Mr Justice McDougall has the following to say concerning the correct approach to pleadings: 


"" Further, in considering pleadings, it will be necessary to have regard to the onus of proof and, at least in New South Wales, to the requirements of s 5D of the CL Act. 

It will be observed that the form of defence propounded in Nemeth simply sought an order that the relevant defendant's liability be ""limited to such other proportion [of the plaintiff's loss and damage] as the Court determines is just and equitable, having regard to the extent of [that defendant's] liability for any damage."" 

To my mind, a defence in those terms should not be permitted. If pleaded, it should be struck out; and if sought to be raised by amendment, leave to amend should be refused. That is so even having regard to the more liberal rules that attend proceedings entered in the Technology and Construction List. 

If a defendant wishes to take advantage of the statutory regime for limitation of its liability, it should plead, and particularise adequately, the material facts. To my mind, that would require the defendant to identify the other persons whom it believes to be concurrent wrongdoers, and to set out the material facts that, it says, show that they are concurrent wrongdoers. In other words, I think, a proper pleading should address the issues raised by s 35(1)(b) of the Act: identifying the alleged concurrent wrongdoer and the circumstances that may make that person a concurrent wrongdoer. In substance, the defendant should plead with the same degree of precision and particularity as it would do under the old regime if it were bringing a cross-claim against that alleged concurrent wrongdoer. "" 

20Both parties in these proceedings may find assistance in reviewing their pleadings from these practical observations. 

21An additional problem in these proceedings is the time factor. Given the long period of time that has elapsed since the activities of the parties asserted to be concurrent wrongdoers, and the activities of the council since that time, the question arises as to whether the persons identified by the defendant as concurrent wrongdoers are liable to the plaintiffs under the general law. There is a potential inconsistency on this issue between the NSW Supreme Court ( Ucak v Avante Developments Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 367) and decisions of the Federal Court ( Shrimps v Landmark Operations Limited [2007] FCA 1468) and Victorian Supreme Court ( Atkins v Interprac Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 445), as is pointed out in Lim and Wayland, ""Litigation Update: proportionate liability"", Australian Civil Liability (Newsletter) (2008) Volume 5 No 1 (May 2008) . I have suggested that the parties consider this issue as well. The question of whether liability arose before the relevant date for the Act was one of a series of reasons why Schmidt J in Permanent Custodians Ltd v King [2010] NSWSC 509 refused to permit such an amendment. 

22As I am dealing with these proceedings without more information than is contained in the pleadings, it is not possible for me to do more than outline some potential problem areas. The parties will return on 20 May to advise whether, having considered these matters, they are ready to take a third hearing date. 

23I note Mr Justice McDougall's comments, in his helpful overview of these statutory provisions, about the benefits of specialist list case management, in the Supreme Court's Technology and Construction List, for early recognition of problems specific to building cases. There is no such list in this court, which puts the responsibility on practitioners for identifying problems. The court, in return, should be flexible and provide what assistance it can to practitioners in managing these often complex cases.

		22 July 2011",2011-05-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2756954,R v Jomaa [2011] NSWSC 342,"Judgment 

1The Applicant Mohamad Jomaa was arrested and charged on 22 September 2010 pursuant to s 307.5(1) Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) that he did attempt to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug (32.45 kilograms of cocaine) that was unlawfully imported into Australia. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for life and/or 7500 penalty units. 

2Four other persons including one Brian Anthony Blackman were charged on the same day with similar offences as part of the same Australian Federal Police operation. 

3The Applicant has been in custody since the date of his arrest. He now makes application for bail. 

4Section 307.5 Criminal Code is an offence listed in s 8A Bail Act 1978. Section 8A(2) provides: 

A person accused of an offence to which this section applies is not to be granted bail unless the person satisfies the authorised officer or court that bail should not be refused. 

5A number of decisions have discussed the effect of the presumption against bail to be found in s 8A and corresponding sections 8B, 8C and 8D. In R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 473 the Court of Appeal said: 

The presumption against bail expressed in that section imposes a difficult task upon the person so charged to persuade the court why bail should not be refused. That presumption expresses a clear legislative intention that persons charged with the serious drug offences specified in the section should normally - or ordinarily - be refused bail. That is the effect of a series of decisions by single judges of the Supreme Court, most recently collected and discussed in R v Kissner (Hunt CJ at CL, 17 January 1992, unreported). 

6In R v Kissner (Unreported - Hunt CJ at CL - 17 January 1992) Hunt CJ at CL said this: 

The strength of the Crown case has become the prime consideration where s8A applies: see for example: Regina v Michael Youssef Toubya (15 November 1990); Regina v Garry Roy Morton (15 May 1990); Regina v Antonio Franco (23 July 1991); Regina v David Clyde Brown (25 July 1991), all unreported. Common to all bail applications are the circumstances that the applicant's continued incarceration will cause a serious deprivation of his general right to be at liberty, together with hardship and distress to himself and his family, and usually with severe effects upon the applicant's business or employment, his finances and his abilities to prepare his defence and to support his family. Also common to most bail applications by persons charged with the offences to which s8A applies is the availability of sureties prepared to forfeit (with or without security) large sums of money to ensure that the applicant will answer his bail; an application would otherwise be unlikely to be considered in relation to such serious matter. The Legislature has, notwithstanding all those particular circumstances, enacted the presumption against bail in these cases, so that such circumstances will not ordinarily be sufficient to overcome the barrier to bail which s8A has erected. As Badgery-Parker J said: if the Crown case is a strong one, the applications for bail in which they will be sufficient to do so must necessarily be somewhat special, and the task of the applicant to overcome the presumption that bail is to be refused will ordinarily be a difficult one. On the other hand, if the Crown case is not a strong one, the circumstances to which I have referred in the last paragraph will ordinarily be given greater weight, and the task of the applicant (although still a substantial one) will be correspondingly less difficult. 

7However, although the strength of the Crown case is the prime consideration it is not the exclusive consideration: R v Iskandar (2001) 120 A Crim R 302 at 305 [14]. One further relevant consideration is the time that the person might spend in custody before a trial date if bail were not granted: and R v Cain (No. 1) (2001) 121 A Crim R 365 at 367 [9]. 

8In Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Germakian (2006) 166 A Crim R 201 Tobias JA with whom Ipp JA agreed endorsed the principles in the cases to which I have referred and went on to say: 

[18] I pause here to observe two matters. The first is that in a case to which s8A applies, such as the present, the s32 considerations to which I have referred do not have the force that they otherwise would have in cases to which s8A would be inapplicable. As was [sic] Hunt CJ at CL observed in Kissner , by enacting s8A with respect to an offence such as the present, the legislature intended the court to place less weight upon the circumstances which are common to all applicants for bail and more weight upon the strength of the Crown case against the applicant in the particular case under consideration. 

[19] Accordingly, given the heavy burden that rests upon an applicant to satisfy the court that bail should be granted in a case to which s8A applies, and that the application must be "" somewhat special "" if the Crown case in support of the charge is strong, the mere fact that a consideration of the relevant s32 considerations would ordinarily support the grant of bail is not of itself sufficient to displace the presumption against bail in relation to offences to which s8A applies. 

[20] The second observation I would make is that, on one view of it, Hall J in [37] of his judgment, when observing that there was no evidence which established a particular capacity of the respondent to abscond or the existence of overseas contacts or substantial financial resources to enable or encourage him to do so, would seem, at least prima facie, to have reversed the burden of proof. With respect, I would have thought that to displace the presumption imposed by s8A, the onus did not lie upon the Crown to provide evidence which established a particular capacity by the respondent to abscond or that he had received any financial benefits from the alleged offence, or that he had overseas contacts or other financial resources: rather, the onus lay with the respondent to positively establish that he had no such capacity and/or that he had no link or association with the persons who supplied the drugs that he allegedly imported. ... 

9In the same case Basten JA suggested that it was necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate circumstances which are exceptional, special or even unusual to overcome the presumption - at [54]. 

The Applicant's proposal 

10What is proposed in the present case is (1) that the Applicant agree to have a tracking device installed on his person, (2) there be strict reporting conditions, and (3) security said to be worth approximately $2.4 million is to be made available from members of the Applicant's family. 

11In relation to the first matter the Applicant read an affidavit of Paul Keen, a Director of Abakus ElmoTech Pty Limited, a company which supplies personal monitoring/tracking systems. The fitting of such a bracelet to the Applicant would mean that his whereabouts could be monitored, provided he was still wearing the equipment, and the monitor of the service would be alerted if the Applicant moved beyond what are called monitor inclusion areas. The affidavit pointed out that in other cases where such devices had been employed the court had nominated a responsible Police officer to receive in real time violation reports automatically from the system by way of SMS or email. 

12The cost of the service is $18,000 plus GST per annum but the Applicant has agreed to bear that cost himself. 

13In relation to the provision of security his parents Abbas and Lamia Jomaa offer 2 properties owned by them at 25 Cook St, Turrella and 207 Wollongong Road, Arncliffe. A valuation has been provided by Mr and Mrs Jomaa for each of the properties showing that at 24 November 2010 the property at 25 Cook St, Turrella was worth $900,000 and the property at 207 Wollongong Road, Arncliffe was worth $1 million. 

14Although the title searches show a mortgage to the National Australia Bank there is evidence that the loan from that Bank has been paid out by a company called Jomaa Company Pty Ltd said to be owned by a brother of the Applicant, Koder Jomaa but also, apparently, the trustee of the Jomaa Family Trust. The titles also show a caveat in favour of that company and attached to a copy of the mortgage to that company is what amounts to an Epitome showing a borrowing of $1,512,910.65 for a one year period at a lower interest rate of 10% per annum. The proposal put is that Jomaa Company Pty Ltd will lift its caveat to give priority to the charge in favour of the State. There is an earlier caveat on each property about which there was no evidence. 

15There is also an offer by Fatima and Rafic Saab (Fatima is the older sister of the Applicant) to offer the property owned jointly by them at 4 Knoll Avenue, Turrella. They say that the property is worth about $800,000 and has a mortgage of $275,000 to the ANZ Bank. No approach has been made to the ANZ Bank to see if it will consent to the further encumbering of the property. 

16Objection was taken by the Crown to the Saabs being able to place a value of about $800,000 on the property when they were not qualified to do so. Mr Saab said he had been told the value by a named estate agent a week or two before he gave evidence. I have no doubt that his evidence in that regard was truthful. I permitted the evidence to be given in the circumstances of a bail application after I had heard a description of the property. The figure did not strike me as unlikely. 

Facts 

17On 17 September 2010 Australian Customs and Border Protection Service had detected in an unopened shipping container on a ship berthed at Port Botany a sports bag concealed within the container. The container was unloaded and opened. Inside were 2 blue Adidas branded sports bags containing 49 individually wrapped blocks. Those blocks contained a compressed white powder which was ultimately found to be cocaine. The gross weight of the cocaine was 48.22 kilograms. 

18The cocaine was removed and an inert substance substituted. The sports bags were then returned to the container. This was thereafter placed under physical and electronic surveillance by the AFP and Customs. 

19On 22 September 2010 at about 1:00am the sports bags were removed from the container which had been moved to the Macarthur Intermodal Shipping Terminal at Stonny Batter Road, Minto. The vehicle used in the removal of those bags (a white Holden utility) was then driven to Prendergast Avenue, Minto and parked outside 12 Bigge Way, Minto. That address is where one of the other co-accused, Bronwyn Reely resides. 

20At various times on 19 September and 22 September there were phone calls between the co-accused Blackman and the Applicant. 

21On 22 September 2010 the Applicant and Blackman were seen to alight from a grey Holden Calais vehicle outside 12 Bigge Way and approach the Holden utility which had transported the sports bags from the shipping terminal. The Applicant was seen to remove one of the sports bags containing the cocaine substitute. Subsequent fingerprint analysis identified the Applicant's left palm print on the passenger side of that vehicle. 

22The Applicant then placed the sports bag into the boot of the Holden Calais. Subsequently Blackman removed the second sports bag from the Holden utility and handed it to the Applicant who placed it also in the boot of the Holden Calais. 

23That vehicle then drove away from the premises. A short time later intercepts revealed the sound of one of the sports bags being moved and a zipper being activated on the bag. Minutes later Blackman said: ""Fucking yes, that's (indecipherable) it"". 

24About 2 minutes later intercepts revealed the sound of a zipper being activated on one of the bags followed by the Applicant saying: 

Oh fuck, there's a tape recorder down here. There's a fucking tape recorder. Nah, nah, stop it."" 

This was followed by laughter, indicating to the police that this was a joke by the Applicant. 

25The vehicle was driven from Minto to Riverwood and, when at the intersection of Hannans Road and Bonds Road, Riverwood, it was stopped by the AFP who then arrested the Applicant, Blackman and another co-accused, Christodoulou , who was driving and whose vehicle it was. 

The Applicant 

26The Applicant is a Lebanese born Australian citizen aged 34 years. He is married and works in the family business known as Sydney Freezers at 120 Turrella Street, Turrella. This business sells frozen foods to other wholesalers and businesses. 

27There are no children from his marriage but he has a child from a previous relationship. There is a considerable dispute about how close he is to that daughter and how frequently he sees her. His wife said it was once or twice a month. One of the police officers monitoring the Applicant said there were about 3 - 4 occasions from May 2009 to September 2010 when he saw the child. 

28The Applicant is one of six children of his parents who immigrated to Australia from Lebanon in 1976. His parents are currently in Lebanon where they have been for a number of years. One of the Applicant's brothers gave evidence that they were now too old to travel. The Applicant's brother Koder has lived in Lebanon since at least August 2010. 

29The Applicant has no prior criminal convictions. 

Strength of the Crown case 

30As this is a bail application the assessment of the strength of the Crown case must be made on the basis of the material, largely contained in the documents tendered by the Crown, without there being any ability to test witnesses or the evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence, prima facie, discloses a reasonably strong Crown case against the Applicant. The following matters indicate this: 

(a) The sports bags hidden in the container contained a large quantity of cocaine. 

(b) In the early hours of the morning following the removal of the container to the shipping terminal the sports bags were removed from the container and driven to Reely's residence at 12 Bigge Way, Minto. 

(c) In the afternoon of that day Blackman and the Applicant were observed to arrive outside the residence. The Applicant was observed to lift up the tarpaulin of the Holden utility and remove one of the sports bags. His palm print is on the Holden utility. He was observed to place that sports bag into the boot of the vehicle in which he had arrived. Blackman was observed to retrieve the second sports bag from the Holden utility and hand it to the Applicant who thereupon placed it in the vehicle in which they had arrived. 

(d) The listening devices recorded the conversations which I have set out in paras [23] and [24] above. The conversations taken together are capable of it being inferred that Blackman and the Applicant knew what they expected to find in the bags and that because it was illegal someone might have been recording their conversations in relation to it. 

(e) The bags were still in the Holden Calais at the time it was stopped by the AFP and the Applicant and others were arrested. 

31One matter that may be of some significance in undermining the Crown case is the absence of any DNA from the Applicant from any exhibits or crime scene sites. On the information that I have it is difficult how significant that matter is but it must be set against the matters that I have referred to above which appear clearly to place the Applicant at the relevant locations and in the presence of the sports bags. 

32Although the Applicant has no other convictions, he was not a stranger to involvement or intended involvement with drugs. Lawfully recorded intercepts disclose conversations between the Applicant and Blackman on 24 June 2009 when the Applicant was a patient at Prince of Wales Hospital. These conversations suggest that the Applicant and Blackman were discussing the importation into Australia of the drug Speed. Those conversations show also that the Applicant's brother Koder was known to Blackman and that Blackman had been in contact with Koder. The conversation included the Applicant asking Blackman how much he would get from the proposed importation. It is accepted that no charges were laid in relation to that matter. 

33In my opinion, the Crown case is a reasonably strong one against the Applicant. 

Other considerations 

34Although, as I have noted, the strength of the Crown case is the prime consideration, it is also necessary to have regard to the matters in s 32 of the Act. Because I have found that the Crown case is a reasonably strong one I consider that the Applicant has a heavier onus than would otherwise be the case in relation to relevant s 32 considerations. 

(a) Delay 

35The Applicant points to the fact that the committal hearing is set down for 10, 11 and 12 October 2011. Because, it is submitted, it is likely the Magistrate will reserve his or her decision, it is unlikely that the matter will proceed to trial before June 2012. Since the Applicant has been in custody since September 2010 he would, by that stage, have spent some 21 months in custody awaiting trial. 

36Since reserving my decision in the matter I received correspondence from the Commonwealth DPP (copied to the Solicitor for the Applicant) setting out the results of enquiries made of the Downing Centre District Court Criminal Listing Directorate. The information is that if the Applicant was committed for trial in mid-October 2011 it would be likely that a date would be given for a 4 week trial in the District Court in February 2012. 

37Evidence from the solicitor with the carriage of the prosecution at the Commonwealth DPP shows that there has been substantial compliance by the DPP in serving the brief and other statements. The Applicant makes no complaint on this application about any delay on the part of the DPP. 

38In all of these circumstances, and even if the trial did not take place until June 2012, I do not consider that there is any matter arising out of a factor of delay that would entitle the Applicant to special consideration in this regard. It seems to me also to be a matter of some significance that the Applicant first applied for bail in this Court on 14 October 2010. When the matter came before Harrison J on 25 November 2010 it was adjourned to 16 December (no reasons for that appear on the file) and when the matter came before Fullerton J on 16 December 2010 the bail application was withdrawn. The present bail application was filed on 1 February 2011. No explanation was provided for why the earlier bail application was adjourned and then withdrawn. 

39One of the cases put forward by the Applicant to justify bail on condition of electronic monitoring was R v RS [2011] NSWSC 103. A reading of that judgment discloses that the case was held by Buddin J to fall into an exceptional category because of what he described as the inordinate period of time which the respondent already had spent and would be required to spend in custody awaiting the finalisation of the proceedings against him if bail were to be refused. Buddin J said that it was likely he would have spent 3 years in custody before trial - see at [21] and [26]. In my opinion, there is no relevant comparison to the situation in the present case. 

(b) Protection of witnesses 

40The Crown points to the fact that there is an Apprehended Violence Order in existence against the Applicant from his former partner. The Crown also points to what is contained in the COPS report provided to me where there are various expressions of opinion by those making entries in the COPS report suggesting that the Applicant is to be treated with caution, that he may be aggressive and abusive and that he may be in possession of one or more firearms. 

41Whilst in no sense minimising the seriousness of domestic violence, there is no evidence in the present case of the basis upon which the Applicant's ex-partner obtained the AVO. Nor is it, in itself, any indication that the Applicant is or might be a violent person generally. Further, the information in the COPS material is piecemeal and contains conclusions about this matter without satisfactory supporting material. 

42Nothing in the material that I have suggests that there is a risk to witnesses if the Applicant were released to bail. 

(c) Flight risk 

43The Applicant is prepared to surrender his passport which is an Australian passport. During the hearing of the application I asked if the Applicant had or was entitled to a Lebanese passport since he was born there. I was informed that he does not have a Lebanese passport. There was a dispute, however, about whether he was entitled to one. In my opinion, where the onus is on the Applicant to show that bail should not be refused, it was incumbent upon the Applicant to prove that he was not entitled to any passport other than his Australian passport. 
44There is no doubt that the Applicant has strong family connections in Lebanon. His parents now live there and, it would seem from the evidence of his brother Abbas, that they do not intend to return to Australia because they are too old to travel. In addition, the Applicant's brother Koder has lived in Lebanon since August 2010 and before that had spent considerable time there. The Applicant clearly has a close relationship with Koder which can be judged not only from Koder's offer to postpose priority for the $1.5 million he lent to his parents on the proposed security properties, but also by the telephone calls passing between the Applicant and Koder, particularly on the morning of the day the sports bags were picked up by the Applicant and, perhaps, more significantly, by the call the Applicant made to Koder within minutes of having collected the bag. I note again that there also seems to be some association between Koder and Blackman, and Blackman spoke of Koder to the Applicant whilst discussing the plan to import Speed. 

45In addition, I place some, but not great, weight on what appears in the COPS report concerning the transfer by the Applicant of s ome $350,000 in cash overseas in February 2008 or thereabouts. I note also that the Applicant's wife was charged with illegally taking 15,000 from Australia although she was subsequently acquitted. I think that this is a matter of minimal significance f or the purposes of this bail application. 

46Despite the evidence of the Applicant's wife about the way the Applicant feels about Lebanon, I do not think it could be said that he has no interest in travelling to Lebanon particularly because his parents reside there and are elderly, and because of the presence of his brother Koder there. Those close family connections must be seen in the light of the fact that the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment and if convicted the Applicant will inevitably spend a lengthy period of time in gaol, likely to be in excess of 10 years. There is an incentive to flee to a place he knows where close family members reside although I accept that that would mean being separated from his daughter. 

47Two other matters cause me some concern in relation to this issue. The first concerns the Applicant's undoubted close association with Blackman. The evidence discloses that Blackman was at relevant times a member of the Lone Wolf Motorcycle Club. In turn, he is an associate within that Club and by telephone records of Erkan Keskin who has been charged and is awaiting trial on offences of producing false travel documents. Secondly, one of the Applicant's brothers, Ali Jomaa, was convicted in 2004 of being in possession of and using false instruments including a false driver's licence. I have concerns by reason of the Applicant's association with those persons that he thereby may have access to false identification and travel documents which would enable him to leave Australia much more easily than a person without such contacts. 

48No doubt because of these factors the Applicant proposes that he should be electronically monitored whilst on bail. My attention has been drawn to 2 recent cases where electronic monitoring has been imposed as a bail condition. I have made reference already to R v RS but there is another factor not mentioned in that case to which I will refer in a moment. The other case was R v Medich [2010] NSWSC 1488. 

49Some evidence was given by Officer Gavyn Tomkinson from the AFP about enquiries that he had made of Paul Keen, the Director of Abakus ElmoTech and with the police officer who was dealing with the monitoring of Mr Medich. His evidence was challenged by Mr Walker SC who appeared for the Applicant as lacking any precision in terms of times and distances. There was some force in the challenge made to this evidence. 

50Nevertheless, the evidence disclosed that the electronic monitoring system works by having three zones. There is the permitted zone in which the person monitored is entitled to be. There are then exclusion zones where the person is not permitted to be, and around the exclusion zones there are warning zones which, if the person enters them, results in a message or signal being sent to the monitor that the person monitored is approaching the exclusion zone. 
51What was not made clear on any of the evidence was how small the permitted zone was able to be for the operation of the equipment. That issue was of considerable significance because the Applicant's home address at xxxxxx Brighton-Le-Sands is within a relatively short distance of the international airport (perhaps a few kilometres) and is in close proximity to Botany Bay. In addition, the usual workplace of the Applicant in Arncliffe is also within a short distance of the airport. 

52What was asserted, although in somewhat unsatisfactory terms, by Officer Tompkinson was that the vicinity of the airport and Botany Bay was so close that the exclusion and warning zones around those places would be tripped frequently by the mere fact that the Applicant was at home or at work or travelling between the two. 

53Officer Tomkinson also drew attention to what he had been told in relation to the monitoring of Mr Medich that there were constant false alarms and human error where the person monitored had omitted to wear both parts of the monitoring device. 

54The evidence was left in a very unsatisfactory state and I do not have any clear information about whether it would be feasible to establish permitted zones in areas as close to the airport (in particular) as the Applicant lives and works without there being frequent false alarms. Again, bearing in mind that the onus is on the Applicant to show that bail should not be refused, I do not consider that the Applicant has discharged his onus of showing that electronic monitoring would be a secure and feasible system to release him to bail. The evidence about the monitoring was, in the first instance, led by the Applicant, but with no consideration of the specific matters that were quite legitimately raised by the Crown through Officer Tomkinson. Even if I had not found that the Crown case was a reasonably strong one I would not have considered that the onus of proof had been satisfied by the Applicant in this regard. 

55In R v RS there was not only the exceptional circumstance of the 3 year delay in the matter coming to trial but also, at the time Buddin J considered the application, the person charged had been at large in the community for 2 months and had observed his bail conditions. He was required to live on the Northern Peninsula and to report to Dee Why Police Station. That is a considerable distance from any point of international departure so that the issue raised by the width of the zones in the present case had no application there. His observance of bail conditions for the 2 months was considered important by Buddin J. 

56In relation to Medich it was not shown that he had any family other than in Sydney. Although he had business reasons for travelling overseas he had voluntarily attended at his solicitor's office for the purpose of being arrested. It is apparent from the judgment that he was released to bail on various conditions including electronic monitoring because Price J found that the Crown case was not a strong one - see at [52]. 

57The other principal matter put forward by the Applicant is the provision of the various properties as security for his attendance at Court. Although the Crown points to the fact that Jomaa Company Pty Ltd still has a caveat on the property the evidence tends to suggest that that caveat will be lifted and the priority of the mortgage will be postponed to the Crown's interest in those 2 properties. 

58I cannot at the moment be satisfied that the 3 rd property at 4 Knoll Avenue, Turrella will be available because no consent has yet been obtained from the First Mortgagee. However, I accept the submission on behalf of the Applicant that it can be made a condition of bail that the properties be offered as security to a certain sum so that if that does not occur the Applicant will not be released to bail. 

59I am not satisfied in the face of a reasonably strong Crown case, and in circumstances where the street value of the cocaine involved is estimated to be between $22-$25 million that the provision of security to the extent of $2.4 million (assuming that is its value) is adequate to serve as a sufficient deterrent to the Applicant absconding. 

Conclusion 

60In the face of a reasonably strong case the Applicant had a heavy onus to show that the s 32 matters meant that bail should not be refused. The most significant of those was the consideration in s 32(1)(a). In my opinion even if there had not been a reasonably strong case the evidence was such that I would have little confidence that the Applicant would appear in court to answer the offence charged when regard is had to the maximum penalty for the offence, the Applicant's continuing family links in Lebanon, and the association of him and his brother Koder with the co-accused Blackman. When the strength of the Crown case is considered the Applicant fails to satisfy me that bail should not be refused. 

61For these reasons, bail is refused.

		09 May 2011",2011-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2756956,Hanh Thi Nguyen v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 92,"Judgment 

1SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Grove AJ. Subject to what follows, I agree with his Honour's analysis. I do not propose to restate the facts, or the arguments. 

2I have difficulty with the proposition that the applicant was a ""principal"" in the drug enterprise. A finding to that effect was made by the sentencing judge where she held that the applicant and Mr Ngo were, on the evidence available, partners and joint principals of the operation (ROS p 6), and, again, in saying, of the applicant, that ""she was one of at least two principals"" (ROS p 7). She explained this by adding: 

""[The applicant] was physically involved in an important part of the cultivation process; she was not associated with the major part of the setting up but was involved in the day to day management of the crop and recruited Mr Vu to assist her. She was seeking to profit from the venture but there is no information as to how much she was seeking to make."" 

This was immediately followed by: 

""I accept that she was used by others who may have preyed upon her naivety and vulnerability ..."" 

3The fact finding exercise for her Honour was difficult. The Agreed Statement of Facts was, in part, based upon a recorded interview in which, as the applicant subsequently acknowledged, she did not tell the truth. The evidence the applicant gave in the sentencing proceedings was, in many respects, not credible, as her Honour found. That left the sentencing judge with little basis for evaluating the role played by the applicant. 

4There was, in my opinion, no proper basis for the finding that the applicant was a principal. ""Principal"" is an expression that is commonly used in sentencing in respect of drug offenders, but may not have a commonly accepted or applied meaning. In my opinion, the indicator of the role of an offender as ""principal"" involves at least some of the following characteristics: 


contributing financially to the cost of setting up the operation; 

standing to share in the profit (as distinct from receiving payment); 

having some hand in the management of the operation (although it is well recognised that principals will, so far as possible, distance themselves from the day to day operation, they nevertheless maintain considerable control over the enterprise); 

having some decision making role (which may not be different from the item above). 

This does not purport to be anything like an exhaustive list. There may well be other features that indicate that an offender ought to be characterised as a principal. 

5In my opinion, in this case, the evidence fell far short of establishing any of these characteristics. 

6A very considerable financial outlay had been made in establishing the cultivation. The premises were rented (which, one would expect, would have involved payment of a bond, and some rent in advance). Considerable modifications had been made to the premises. The Statement of Facts asserted that no less than five rooms had been ""fitted out as sophisticated hydroponic growing rooms"". There were, on my count, no less than 57 ""high wattage heat lights/lamps"". These were supplied with electricity through transformers. The cannabis plants (at least 101, on my count) in four rooms were in pots. There were carbon filters, fans, and pumps. There was ""nutrient rich water"". 

7There was not the slightest evidence that the applicant was in any position to contribute anything financially to this enterprise. Her answer, in the interview, that she had paid the rent from savings, was unbelievable, and did not in any way account for the set up costs. True, her oral evidence threw no light on either the source of the rent money or the source of the set up costs, and anything she did say had to be treated with considerable scepticism. 

8While it could be accepted that the applicant had a day to day hands-on role in the cultivation, I do not discern in the evidence anything on which could reasonably be based a conclusion that she had any management or decision making role (other, perhaps, than when to water the plants) such as to justify the conclusion that she occupied a position as principal (even one of two principals). 

9It is difficult also to reconcile the finding that the applicant was a principal with the subsequent finding that others may ""have preyed upon her naivety and vulnerability"". In my opinion the finding that the applicant was a principal was not open on the evidence. 

10There is no ground of appeal that expressly challenges this finding of fact. The issue was raised only obliquely in written submissions, in which it was put that the applicant was not responsible for the ""sophistication"" of the operation. I would accept that. 

11The finding as to the role played by an offender in a drug enterprise is an important issue going to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. 

12Since this was a case in which a standard non-parole period ( Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") Pt 4 Div 1A) applied, the assessment of objective gravity was of considerable significance. In respect of an offence of mid-range objective gravity (where conviction follows trial) a standard non-parole period of 10 years is prescribed. The finding made by the sentencing judge that the applicant's offence was ""slightly less than mid-range seriousness but at a level much closer to mid-range than low range"" was, to a significant extent, based upon the finding that the applicant was a principal. 

13The result is that, in my opinion, the sentencing proceeded upon a false premise. 

14The Court was provided with summaries of cases in which offenders have pleaded guilty to the same offence. Invariably, in those cases, the sentences imposed were substantially less than the 10 year standard non-parole period. It is true that, since each of the offenders in those cases entered pleas of guilty, the standard non-parole period did not strictly apply, and, even in respect of a mid-range offence, a reduction could be expected by reason of the plea of guilty, the sentences are still well below what might be expected following diligent application of the requirements of Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. What these cases appear to disclose is that the standard non-parole period is not being given the recognition due to statutory mandate. 

15As I have mentioned, an offence in the mid-range of objective gravity attracts a standard non-parole period of 10 years. A reduction of 25 per cent allowed in respect of the plea of guilty (which is what the sentencing judge allowed the applicant) would reduce that non-parole period to 7 years and 6 months. I do not understand the sentencing judge to have found any other reasons for departure from the standard non-parole period. Assuming, because of what I consider to be the more limited role of the applicant than that found by the sentencing judge, the offence is, to some extent, below the mid-range of objective gravity, that circumstance would allow a further reduction. A finding that the offence is ""to some extent"" below mid-range of objective gravity does not adequately discharge the obligation under Pt 4 Div 1A. Given my view that the applicant could not be found to be a principal, I would consider the offence to be moderately below mid-range of objective gravity. However, given also the evidence of her day to day activities, her constant presence, and her responsibility for the maintenance of the plants, the extent to which it falls below mid-range is modest. In this respect, I observe that, in my view, ordinarily one would expect the objective gravity of the offence of a principal to be assessed at significantly above the mid-range of objective gravity. 

16The sentence imposed included a non-parole period less than half of the standard non-parole period. In my opinion, no lesser sentence could possibly be warranted. 

17For those reasons, although I take a different approach to that taken by Grove AJ, I would reach the same result, and agree that leave to appeal ought to be granted, but the appeal dismissed. 

18DAVIES J : I agree with the reasons of Grove AJ and the orders he proposes other than his conclusion that the sentencing Judge's characterisation of the Applicant as a principal was correct. In that regard I agree with the reasons of Simpson J. 

19GROVE AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Syme DCJ in Campbelltown District Court to which the applicant had been committed after pleading guilty in the Local Court to an offence of cultivating not less than a large commercial quantity of prohibited plants (cannabis) by enhanced indoor means. Such offence has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a prescribed standard non-parole period of 10 years. Her Honour took into account in sentence assessment a scheduled further offence of having a false instrument in possession within intent to use it, this being a NSW driver's licence in a false name. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a total term of 6 years 5 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months. 

20Drawing from an agreed statement of facts, her Honour found that on 29 February 2009 police attended the premises at Blairmont where a screen door was forced and the requisite notice read and interpreted to the applicant over a telephone. Within the house five rooms had been fitted out with a sophisticated hydroponic growth system. Each room had heat lamps and lights. Investigation demonstrated that the mains electricity supply board to the house had been bypassed and some sixty-one electrical transformers were located within the house. 

21Four of the rooms had extensive plumbing so as to carry nutrient rich water to the crops and there were also fans, pumps and carbon filters in the rooms. Altogether 317 cannabis plants were growing. Plants in the fifth room were hand watered. Supplies of plant food, chemicals and fertilizers were found in the premises. A large commercial quantity of plants grown in this manner consists of 200 plants. 

22Whilst police were in occupation a co-offender Tuan Trong Vu was seen walking from the kitchen area. He was detained and in due course he was also charged. 

23The applicant was interviewed by Constable McPherson at Macquarie Fields Police Station where, inter alia, she said that she had been living at the premises for about three or four months. She paid rent of $1000 per month to an agent of the owner. She claimed the money was sourced from her own savings. She had met Vu at a coffee shop and, as he had nowhere to stay, she invited him to move into the premises and share the work to be done there. Together they undertook planting and she said that they, and no one else, looked after the plants. The plants that had been located by police were a re-planting after a first intended crop failed. The re-planting occurred about one month before police arrived on the scene. 

24The applicant claimed that she herself had wired the lights and bypassed the electricity meter as well as attending to boarding up some of the windows and to collateral activity such as purchase of fertilizer. She paid the electricity account. She said that she did not yet know what she would do with the plants when they were fully grown. Police estimated the potential street value of the crop, if successful, at $1.2 million dollars. The applicant is a citizen of the Republic of Vietnam and has no visa or other authority permitting her to remain in Australia. 

25At the sentence hearing she gave evidence that she did not tell police the truth when she was interviewed by them. Her Honour made various findings about the credibility or lack of it in the applicant's evidence and these findings have not been the subject of challenge except indirectly to the extent that her Honour categorised the applicant as a principal in the operation. 

26The applicant testified that she became involved in the operation at the behest one John Ngo, a Vietnamese Australian, who befriended her and promised to marry her. It was he who arranged the false identity, convinced her to enter the lease of the premises, set up the hydroponics and electrical circuits and purchased the plants and fertiliser. She said that she originally believed that he intended to grow medicinal herbs. 

27Police inquiries of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship concerning John Ngo, and a possible alias Anh Lam, showed that that Department had no electronic record of any such person. 

28The learned sentencing Judge found that the applicant's evidence that she originally did not know that she was growing cannabis or that it was illegal was totally unconvincing. However her Honour accepted that the applicant herself did not have the skills to install the hydroponic system or attend to the associated electrical wiring. She was satisfied to the necessary standard that the applicant was involved in the initial set up of the cultivation and she planted the crop and re-planted it when this was required. It was her intention to profit from the venture. The applicant knew from the outset that it was illegal to grow these plants and, with that knowledge, she involved herself in the day to day management of it and in the recruitment of an assistant. 

29Her Honour found that the applicant was one of at least two principals, another being the man said to be John Ngo. Her Honour found that allegations by the applicant of threats of harm or worse by Ngo were examples of recent invention which ""she seemed to make up for the purpose of the Court hearing"". She accepted that the applicant was used by others who preyed upon her naivety and vulnerability but she was neither forced nor coerced into participation in the illegal activities. 

30Senior Counsel for the applicant contended that there must have been someone, for example John Ngo, who inspired the decision to grow the crop and either installed or organised the installation of the light fittings and the wiring bypass and associated electrics, who therefore must be regarded as more highly ranked than the applicant in the criminal enterprise. It was submitted that it was wrong to categorise the applicant as a principal. 

31It may well be that there was another, or others, who could be ranked higher than the applicant but the structure of participation in such activity is not necessarily pyramidal. Conceptually there can be principal roles and subordinate roles filled in each category by more than one person. Her Honour's finding (and her reference at one point to the applicant as one of at least two principals) was a description of the position of the applicant as a principal rather than a subordinate. It was not a finding that the applicant was the principal. Her finding was amply justified by the evidence of the applicant's activities and no error has been demonstrated. 

32The first ground of appeal asserted that ""the Learned sentencing Judge erred by failing to properly apply Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the standard non-parole period provisions in sentencing the Applicant."" 

33As above stated, there is an applicable standard non-parole period prescribed for the offence. That prescription is found in the division of the Statute recited in the ground of appeal. Section 54A(2) provides: 

"" 54A What is the standard non-parole period? 

(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division."" 

34Counsel then drew attention to the contrasting expression applicable when assessing sentence (as distinct from setting a non-parole period) legislated in Part 3 Division 1 of the Statute. Section 21A provides: 

"" 21A Aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing 

(1) General 
In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters: 

(a) ... 
(b) ... 
(c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 


35Thus for different purposes it is necessary to distinguish between the ""objective"" features of an offence and the ""subjective"" features of the offender. This does not mean that circumstances personal to the offender cannot objectively affect the seriousness of an offence: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at 186. 

36The challenge by the applicant was largely focused upon the following remarks by her Honour: 

""The charge that Ms Nguyen faces is subject to a standard non-parole period of ten years. The question for the court to ask is whether there are proper reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. I have considered the objective seriousness of the offence in light of the facts which relate directly to the commission of the offence and why it was committed to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of this particular kind. I have also considered the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation, including the plea of guilty, but not limited to the plea of guilty. I accept that the standard non-parole period is a guide to the sentence to be imposed for a mid range offence where the matter has proceeded to trial. 
In this case, taking into account the offender's level of involvement, the number of plants; her expectation of some profit, financial or otherwise; her level of naivety; the reasons, personal to her circumstance, as to why she involved herself in the offence; her remorse and contrition; her early plea and the difficulties she will have in custody due to the lack of a support system in Australia. I find the criminality of this offence to be of slightly less than mid range seriousness but at a level much closer to mid range than low range."" 

37It is evident that her Honour therein expressed taking into account some subjective factors, for example remorse and contrition, when considering the objective seriousness of the offence. Such factors would not be available for such purpose. Hence it was argued there were unavailable elements taken into account in scaling into the range dictated by the provisions concerning standard non-parole periods when considering that issue. 

38Be that as it may, such subjective factors as her Honour mentioned patently favoured the applicant and would not have elevated the assessment of seriousness. The essential question is whether her Honour erred in finding, when dealing with standard non-parole period, that the offence was ""slightly less than mid range of seriousness but at a level much closer to mid range than low range."" 

39As above described, the growing of this illicit crop was obviously planned and involved installation of a complex of irrigation and electrical support mechanisms. Although the applicant was not the initiator nor the installer of the systems, she was unsupervised in advancing the cultivation and in charge of the operation to the extent that, inter alia, she could re-plant a failed crop and recruit assistance from Vu. 

40Although there were errors as above identified in her Honours remarks concerning standard non-parole period, an assessment excluding consideration of purely subjective matters, could not reasonably place the objective seriousness of this offence any lower in range than that which her Honour found. 

41The ground fails because no adverse consequence to the applicant has been shown. 

42The second ground relied upon by the applicant contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Allowing for the reduction for the plea of guilty, it can be calculated that a head sentence of approximately eight and a half years was initially contemplated. 

43As above noted, for the purposes of the offence a large commercial quantity is set at 200 plants whereas this crop exceeded 300 plants. Senior Counsel for the applicant in his written submission acknowledged that the offence was serious and that it was ""a relatively sophisticated operation"". He proceeded to contrast the specification of 200 plants as a large commercial quality with the specification at 1000 plants for what he described as ""the ordinary case"". Such an ""ordinary case"" would not involve growing by enhanced indoor means. Thus if the applicant's offence was an ""ordinary case"" the number of plants would be less than the large commercial quantity and thereby attract a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years to which is attached no standard non-parole period. 

44The comparison is otiose and the argument is fallacious. It implies that the legislature has left available the comparison now advanced. Clearly it was intended that there be a discrimination in terms of the number of plants grown between a crop cultivated by enhanced indoor means against a crop not so grown. It is of passing interest to note that in the second reading speech of the Minister introducing the relevant level, the Parliament was informed that ""cannabis plants cultivated by hydroponic or other enhanced indoor means grow much faster than plants grown by traditional outdoor methods, and produce between 5 and 7 times the yield."" He went on to explain that the purpose of the amendment was to address the inequity in commerciality between ""bush grown"" and hydroponic cannabis operations. 

45There is no need to repeat what has already been observed in relation to the seriousness of the offence and the contribution of this offender. Counsel referred to summaries and outcomes of cases including those collected by Hislop J in Tran v R (2010) NSWCCA 72. In addition to those cases reference was made to R v LP (2010) NSWCCA 154 (which was a Crown appeal wherein the offender had received a substantial discount for assistance) and Wong v R (2010) NSWCCA 160. 

46In the latter case 255 plants were involved in indoor cultivation and the offender received a sentence of 3 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months. It was claimed that his role was similar to that of the applicant. Any similarity is very limited. Wong came to a house where the crop was already growing. At age 22 he was seeking accommodation and he came to an agreement whereby he watered and fertilized the plants in lieu of paying rent. Significantly Barr AJ (McClellan CJ and CL and Hislop J agreeing) observed that no assistance was received from examination of cited cases. His Honour said: 

""[ 14] The appropriate way to consider any submission about manifest excess is to gather the salient facts of the case and assess them by reference to the maximum applicable sentence and the standard non-parole period. The maximum sentence was 20 years imprisonment. That resulted from the fact that there were more than 200 plants, which for plants cultivated by enhanced indoor means, constituted a large commercial quantity. The standard non-parole period was imprisonment for 10 years. "" 

47The applicant was one of the principals in a planned and calculated criminal enterprise. The ultimate sentence represented less than half the prescribed maximum head sentence and less than half the standard non-parole period. Such sentence was not manifestly excessive. 

48I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

		09 May 2011",2011-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2756957,Kearns v R [2011] NSWCCA 103,"Judgment 

1GILES JA : This is a case referred under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). For the reasons which follow, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 

Background 

2In the latter part of 2002 the appellant stood trial before Dodd DCJ and a jury on an indictment containing nine counts alleging breaches of the then Corporations Law (C'th) and the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The trial extended from 23 September 2002 to 2 December 2002. On the lastmentioned date the appellant was found guilty on all counts. 

3The offences arose from the appellant's conduct between 30 September 1994 and 18 May 1995 in relation to Nambucca Investments Pty Ltd (""Nambucca"") and related companies in the Nambucca Group. The Nambucca Group operated in and from Macksville in northern New South Wales. Funds were raised by the issue of debentures, and were used in the provision of mortgage finance and the purchase and development of property. Investors provided funds through a trustee pursuant to a trust deed. The funds were utilised through companies which included Nambucca, Lawnkin Pty Ltd (""Lawnkin"") and Teamcask Pty Ltd (""Teamcask""). 

4In summary, the offences of which the appellant was found guilty were - 

Count 1: Improperly using his position as an officer of Nambucca by causing it to pay $50,000 to Snoco Ltd (""Snoco"") ( Corporations Law , ss 232(6) and 1317FA(1)); 

Count 2: Improperly using his position as an officer of Lawnkin by causing it to pay $50,000 to Snoco (ibid); 

Count 3: Improperly using his position as an officer of Lawnkin by causing it to pay $13,342.27 to Snoco (ibid); 

Count 4: Improperly using his position as an officer of Teamcask by causing it to pay $51,577.73 to Snoco (ibid); 

Count 5: Dishonestly obtaining by deception from Lawnkin bank cheques for $100,000 and $200,000 for himself or Snoco ( Crimes Act , s 178BA); 

Count 6: Making a false statement to Roselyn and Kevin Forbes with intent to obtain $130,000 for Nambucca ( Crimes Act , s 178BB); 

Count 7: Dishonestly obtaining by deception from Betty Bohannon a cheque for $20,000 for Nambucca ( Crimes Act , s 178BA); 

Count 8: Dishonestly obtaining by deception from Roselyn and Kevin Forbes a cheque for $30,000 for Nambucca (ibid); and 

Count 9: Making a false statement to Roselyn and Kevin Forbes with intent to obtain $88,717.56 for Nambucca ( Crimes Act , s 178BB). 

5On 18 December 2002 the appellant was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 

6The appellant appealed against conviction and applied for leave to appeal against sentence. The sole ground of the conviction appeal was that the trial judge had also been the trial judge in a matter of Damien Parkes, another person involved in Nambucca. 

7On 1 December 2003 the appeal against conviction was dismissed, and leave was granted to appeal against sentence but the appeal was dismissed: R v Kearns [2003] NSWCCA 367. 

8An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused: Kearns v The Queen [2004] HCA Trans 553. 

9On 16 April 2007 the Minister for Justice and Customs referred the whole of the case in relation to the Commonwealth offences to this Court, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act , pursuant to s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . On 1 August 2007 a like referral was made by the Attorney General for New South Wales in relation to the State offences. 

10Grounds of appeal were filed. The grounds of appeal ultimately maintained were - 

""4. The verdict of the jury in respect of the alleged offences numbered (1) to (5) inclusive of the Indictment as to which the elements alleged by the Crown to ground the charges are that the Appellant was at all relevant times an officer of Nambucca by virtue of: 

a) the Appellant allegedly being in de facto control of Nambucca; 

b) the facts of the execution and delivery by the Trustee for Debenture Holders only and the delivery to the Appellant of, an instrument of retirement from that office, and the execution by the Appellant only and retention by him of, an instrument of acceptance of that office; and 

c) the signing and transmission by the Appellant of a certain facsimile alleged to have been signed and transmitted by the Appellant and referred to in the evidence at the trial as the '14:14 fax', 

should be set aside upon the ground that such verdicts could not and would not be supportable having regard to the whole of the evidence adduced at the trial."" 

""11. The verdict of the jury in respect of the alleged offence numbered (7) in the Indictment should be set aside upon the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence adduced at the trial."" 

""13. By sleeping for significant periods during the trial, the trial Judge failed to exercise supervision and control of the trial resulting in a miscarriage of justice."" 

Is leave to appeal necessary? 

11The nature of an appeal on a referral pursuant to the Western Australian equivalent to s 77(1)(b) was recently considered in Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; (2005) 224 CLR 125. That consideration was taken up for the predecessor to s 77(1)(b) in this State, s 474C(1)(b) of the Crimes Act , in R v JJT [2006] NSWCCA 283; (2006) 67 NSWLR 152. 

12By the terms of s 77(1)(b), the ""whole case"" is referred, and is ""to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912"". This confines the Court to following procedures and making orders apposite to an appeal. It was not disputed that, because the whole case was referred the appellant could rely on grounds of appeal other than the matter or matters raised in the petition for review of his conviction upon which the referrals had been made, see Mallard v The Queen at [10]. The Crown submitted, however, that s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act applied so that leave to appeal against conviction was required unless the appeal was on a ground ""which involves a question of law alone"", and that leave to appeal was necessary for all the grounds of appeal. The Crown opposed the grant of leave to appeal, submitting that none of the grounds was reasonably arguable. 

13The appellant accepted that none of the grounds of appeal involved only a question of law. He submitted that leave to appeal was not required, but that if it was leave should be granted. 

14The appellant drew attention to R v Catt [2005] NSWCCA 279, a referral under s 474C(1)(b) of the Crimes Act , in which McClellan CJ at CL (with the agreements of Adams J and Smart AJ) observed at [14] that ""[i]n so far as the appeal relates to matters of fact no leave is necessary, notwithstanding s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act "". 

15On the other hand, in GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163, a referral pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act which is in materially the same terms as s 77(1)(b), the Court (Tobias JA and Johnson and Rothman JJ), said at [20] that ""the better construction is that leave is required"". Their Honours did not state a final conclusion, because ""the grounds of appeal are at least arguable so that there should be a grant of leave"". 

16There was no detailed consideration of the matter in either R v Catt or GAR v R (No 1) . In R v Catt McClellan CJ at CL referred also to s 474L of the Crimes Act . It provided that on receiving a reference under s 474C(1)(b) ""the Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against conviction ... under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly"". The equivalent under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is s 86, in like terms. Section 86 was not mentioned in GAR v R (No 1) . 

17At the time of R v Catt the Criminal Appeal Rules provided by r 78 that where there was a referral pursuant to s 474C(1) of the Crimes Act ""the person convicted shall be deemed an appellant who has obtained the leave of the Court to appeal"". Although it was not referred to, this underpinned the Chief Judge's observation. Rule 78 as then in force remains, despite the repeal of s 474C and its replacement by s 77(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . It appears that there has been oversight in making an equivalent rule in relation to a referral pursuant to s 77(1). 

18If leave to appeal is necessary, until leave has been granted there is no appeal. On one view, ss 77(1)(b), 79(1)(b) and 86 dictate that there is an appeal, and the direction to deal with the case ""as if the convicted person had appealed against conviction"" bypasses any need for leave to appeal under s 5(1). The Criminal Appeal Act then applies as to the Court's powers and in particular in the disposal of the appeal in accordance with s 6 of that Act. On another view, the words ""as if the convicted person had appealed against conviction"" refer to the convicted person's act of appealing against conviction, which could include any necessary application for leave to appeal, and may not dictate that there is an appeal. The pivotal s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act , and also s 7, apply where there is ""an appeal under s 5(1)"", and if a referral bypasses a need for leave to appeal under s 5(1) it may be that there is a difficulty in the application of these provisions; so that ss 77(1)(b), 79(1)(b) and 86 should be understood conformably with the leave requirement in s 5(1). 

19I incline to the view that leave to appeal is not necessary. The leave requirement in s 5(1) acts as a filter, the alternative in that subsection of the trial judge's certificate that it is a fit case for appeal having the same function. The referral by the Minister (s 77) or the Supreme Court (s 79) is made after a petition for review or an application for an inquiry, and the consideration of the petition for review or the conduct of the inquiry takes the place of consideration of an application for leave to appeal and makes inappropriate a superadded need for leave. The referral involves satisfaction that the case is fit to be dealt with as an appeal. 

20It is true that, because the whole case is referred and the appellant is not confined to grounds of appeal reflecting the matter or matters raised in the petition for review or the application for an inquiry, additional grounds of appeal may be relied on which might otherwise not have survived the filter of a leave requirement. That, however, is met by the approach of Toohey and Gaudron JJ, Mason CJ and Brennan J agreeing, in Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 312, endorsed in Mallard v The Queen at [11] - 

""The words of s 21(a) of the Code, so far as they require 'the whole case ... [to] be heard and determined', permit of only one meaning. It is the whole case which must be passed upon by the application of legal principles appropriate to criminal appeals. That being so, the power to exclude matters from consideration is properly to be seen as an aspect of the inherent power of a court to control its own proceedings. That power will authorize the exclusion of issues which are frivolous or vexatious. However, subject to an issue being properly excluded as frivolous or vexatious, it is, in our view, the duty of a court to which there has been a reference of the whole case to pronounce upon the whole case as presented."" (footnote omitted) 

21It may be noted that in R v Chard (1984) AC 279 at 289, in a passage cited with apparent approval in Mallard v The Queen at [12], Lord Diplock said of s 17(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (UK) that - 

"" ... the person whose case which resulted in his conviction is the subject matter of the reference is to be treated for all purposes as if he were a person upon whom there is conferred by section 1 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 a general right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on any ground which he wishes to rely (whether it be of law or fact or mixed law and fact), without need to obtain the prior leave of that court."" 

22Section 17(1)(a) of the UK Act provided that the referred case ""shall then be treated for all purposes as an appeal to the court ... "". Section 1 of the Criminal Appeal Act (UK) was an equivalent to s 5(1), although differently structured. Lord Diplock appears to have had it in mind, and to have considered that the leave requirement did not apply. 

23It is not necessary to express a concluded view. That the Minister and the Attorney-General have seen fit to refer the case pursuant to s 77(1)(b) is ordinarily a sound, although not inevitable, reason to grant any necessary leave to appeal; see also McClellan CJ at CL in R v JJT at [88]. The Court is aware from interlocutory matters that in the present case the grounds of appeal go beyond the matters raised in the petition for review, which was essentially concerned with what is now ground 13. However, I do not regard the additional grounds as frivolous or vexatious; as will appear, I do not think that any of them should be upheld, but (with reservations as to ground 11) they warrant the grant of leave to appeal. 

24In my opinion, if leave to appeal be necessary it should be granted. 

Ground 4 

25Although it referred to ""offences numbered (1) to (5) inclusive of the Indictment"", this ground concerned only counts 1 to 4. Those counts involved that the appellant made improper use of his position as an officer of Nambucca, Lawnkin or Teamcask by causing money to be paid to Snoco. 

26The ground was not happily worded. The argument was, in short, that it was not reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was an officer of the companies. The written submissions contained some criticism of the Crown's address to the jury and the summing-up, but it was said in oral submissions that that was ""only there to highlight the fact that there was a difficulty with the evidence as presented to the jury"". Expansion of the ground of appeal was disclaimed. 

27It was common ground that the Court's approach to this ground, and to ground 11, was that most recently restated in The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 271 ALR 493 at [33] - 

""[33] The task of an appellate court in considering whether a verdict of guilty returned by a jury 'should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence' was described by this court in M . As four members of the court pointed out in M , the conclusion that a verdict should be set aside on this basis is often expressed in terms of the verdict being 'unsafe or unsatisfactory', 'unjust or unsafe' or 'dangerous or unsafe'. The question for the appellate court is one of fact. 

'[T]he question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.' 

As the plurality in M went on to point out: 

'But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 

The authoritative guidance which this court provided in M about the task of a court of criminal appeal was expressed in the following terms: 

'It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" (footnotes omitted) 

28The only issue under ground 4 as to satisfaction that the appellant was guilty was satisfaction that he was an officer of the companies. 

29Snoco was controlled by the appellant. It held 30 per cent of the shares in a New Zealand company, Equitable Investments Ltd (""Equitable""), through which the appellant (by Snoco) was in a joint venture with the Spencer family who held the remaining 70 per cent of the shares in Equitable. Each of the parties had to subscribe funds to the joint venture, and Snoco had to provide $300,000 by 30 September 1994 and a further $200,000 by late December 2004. In addition, in August 1994 the appellant had made a written offer of $2.5 million to acquire the Spencer shareholding. 

30The sums of money the subject of counts 1 to 4 were paid to Snoco in the period December 1994 - February 1995. On the Crown case, the appellant committed the offences the subject of those counts, and the other offences, to obtain money for Snoco to subscribe the required funds to the joint venture and to obtain money to finance the acquisition of the shares. On that case as to counts 1 to 4, the appellant obtained effective control over the Nambucca Group by falsely representing to the then trustee, and the then members of the board of Nambucca, that Equitable had offered to buy a number of Nambucca companies and to fund Nambucca, and that he was representing the interests of Equitable by assuming control of the Nambucca Group during an escrow period; and having obtained control, the appellant improperly used his position to obtain money to satisfy Snoco's obligation to contribute money to the Equitable joint venture. The trustee was Mr Hilton Searle, and the board members were Mr Phillip Hall, Mr Leslie Hall, Mr John Poynten and Mr John Florent. 

31At the trial, ""control"" was often used in a shorthand way, but the Crown case as to being an officer of the companies as summed up to the jury was that an officer includes a director, a director includes a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company were accustomed to act, and the appellant was such a person (see Corporations Law , s 9). The question was and is one of satisfaction that the directors of the companies were accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of the appellant. 

32It was common ground that Lawnkin and Teamcask were wholly owned subsidiaries of Nambucca. The trial judge suggested to the jury that because of the way the trial had been conducted, if the appellant was an officer of one of the companies he was also an officer of the other companies. It was not suggested on appeal that if the appellant was an officer of Nambucca, he was not also an officer of Lawnkin and Teamcask. 

33The appellant's submissions attributed to the Crown that the relevant control came from the appellant becoming trustee in place of Mr Searle and receiving transfers of the shares in Nambucca companies. He submitted that neither alone nor in combination did those matters establish that the directors of Nambucca were accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions. 

34However, the Crown case was not so limited, and the question was to be decided on the full effect of the whole of the evidence. There was ample evidence (of which becoming trustee in place of Mr Searle and obtaining the share transfers was part) on which it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was an officer of Nambucca. 

35The appellant was introduced to Mr Phillip Hall by Mr Parkes, with whom the appellant had a business relationship, in August 2004. Mr Phillip Hall understood from the discussion that the appellant wished to borrow $3 million to buy out the Spencers, and wanted a further $1.3 million to discharge mortgages over property held by the Equitable Group. At a subsequent meeting, according to Mr Phillip Hall, it was suggested by another person - 

""Why don't you get Nambucca Investments to put up its assets to lend the money to Mr Kearns, and then perhaps you could strike a deal where the insurance company [Equitable] would then take control of Nambucca Investments. That was the basic premise of the suggestion."" 

36The appellant took up the suggestion. On 10 September 1994 the appellant visited Coffs Harbour to discuss the proposal with Mr Florent. On 19 September 1994 the appellant, Mr Phillip Hall and Mr Florent met in New Zealand. The appellant (falsely) told the others that the board of Equitable had agreed to take control of Nambucca. 

37A memorandum dated 27 September 1994 from Mr Phillip Hall to Mr Florent referred to approval of ""the takeover by Equitable of Nambucca Investments"" and set out a number of ""formalities ... in order to effect the takeover"". They included that ""[a] Sydney solicitor associated with Equitable"" would offer himself as trustee to replace Mr Searle ""and consents to such a position"", and that existing directors and secretaries would retire and Equitable's directors and secretaries would be appointed. 

38The appellant was the Sydney solicitor. On 28 September 1994 he sent a 12.05 fax to Mr Searle saying, ""Further to Phillip Hall's letters of yesterday I confirm my consent to act as trustee"", and also confirming ""our preparedness to purchase all of the shares of the Nambucca Group (except Watercraft P/L, F & H Bennett P/L and Spectrum Marketing P/L) for $2 per company"". He sent a 14.14 fax to Mr Searle stating that in the capacity as Executive Deputy Chairman of the Equitable Group of companies he would, amongst other things, arrange through Equitable Insurance ""to unconditionally fund Nambucca Investments Pty Ltd to cover all debenture withdrawals and all funds required by the group that arise in the normal course of business"", and that he confirmed the offer to purchase the shares. The appellant's case at trial was that he had no knowledge of these faxes and that his signature upon them had been fabricated. The jury must have rejected that, and it was accepted on appeal that it was open to them to so find. 

39On 29 September 1994 Messrs Phillip Hall, Leslie Hall, Florent and Searle attended meetings with the appellant and Mr Parkes. Mr Searle signed a Deed of Retirement as trustee. The appellant signed a Deed of Appointment as trustee. The directors of Nambucca and the Nambucca companies resigned and the Messrs Hall were (re)appointed. Transfers of the shares in the Nambucca companies from Nambucca to Equitable had been prepared, and these were signed by the Messrs Hall and given to the appellant. The appellant did not execute them, saying that he wished to keep them blank to enable him to nominate the appropriate corporate entity once the Spencers had been bought out and there was an Equitable/Nambucca restructure. 

40According to the minutes of Nambucca, the appellant ""was instructed as solicitor to attend to the attaching of the Companies Common Seal and organising of the Directors signatures on all deeds and share transfers and to lodge all documents for stamping and registration and complete such documents as required by law to affect [sic] his appointment"". 

41The Messrs Hall continued as directors of Nambucca. However, each gave evidence to the effect that he did what Mr Parkes told him to do because the appellant told them that he appointed Mr Parkes to represent him and that he would give his directions to them through Mr Parkes. Some of the evidence was as follows. 

42Mr Phillip Hall gave evidence - 

""A. That Mr Jim Kearns stated that he would require two people to be directors of the Nambucca Group for what was referred to as the escrow period. That escrow period being referred to was the period from 29 September until such time as the insurance company, Equitable Insurance Limited, had taken control of the Nambucca Group, upon which time my father and I would be extinguished as directors. We were referred to as escrow directors to take instructions from either Mr Parkes, Mr Kearns or a solicitor Mr Michael Fitzgerald."" 

43Mr Phillip Hall gave evidence as to signing a Lawnkin document on 30 September 1994 - 
""Q. How did that document come to be executed by you on that day? 
A. Damien Parkes put it in front of me and asked me to sign it so I signed it. 

Q. Why at that time were you doing what Damien Parkes asked you to do? 
A. Because I was told some time prior to or on 29 September that I was to take instructions from either Mr Kearns, I was told by Mr Kearns to either take them from himself or Mr Parkes who would be operating the affairs on a day to day basis and or Mr Michael Fitzgerald. 

Q. The affairs of what on a day to day basis did you understand Mr Parkes and Mr Fitzgerald to be conducting? 
A. What I understood they were doing were the day to day activities of allowing Equitable Insurance to take control of Nambucca Investments. 

Q. You were appointed a director of Nambucca on 29 September. We've seen the document appointing you, and that your father continued as a director as and from that date. Why was it that you were taking instruction and direction as a director from somebody who was not so connected with the company? 
A. Because Mr Kearns had accepted the role as trustee on the day before, and the trustee, as I had known from several years of experience with the trustee of Nambucca Investments Mr Hilton Searle, had the ultimate control of the company."" 

44In connection with the appellant as trustee, Mr Phillip Hall also gave evidence that he understood that under the terms of the trust deed the trustee could require directors' resignations ""if there's a skirmish or reason to ask ... "". 

45Mr Phillip Hall said more generally - 
""A. No, all financial matters were under the control of Damien Parkes, who was given the title of financial controller for the Nambucca Investments Group by Mr Kearns. 

... 

Q. To what extent did you have contact with Mr Parkes, was it regular, was it intermittent, what was it? 

A. We would talk on the phone many times during the course of each day. He would send me written instructions as to what to do by facsimile, and obviously when he came up he'd sit face to face with me and we'd do things together."" 

46According to Mr Leslie Hall, he was asked by the appellant ""if I would carry on until more or less the due diligence had been completed"", and - 

""Q. In that period of time whilst the due diligence you say was being undertaken did you have any understanding as to who you were to take directions from or who you were to receive instructions from to do the things that you were asked to do? 
A. Either Mr Parkes or Mr Kearns. 

Q. And who told you that you were to take your instructions or directions from those two fellows? 
A. Mr Kearns."" 

47Mr Florent gave evidence that the appellant said he would take Nambucca on to bigger and better things, and - 

""After, shall we say the formal handshake, signing, hand shaking, we're now in control, Mr Kearns made the statement that Mr Parkes, his directions would go through Mr Parkes, and any instruction or direction given by Mr Parkes was to be considered to be a direction from him, and that anything or everything should be directed through him first to get to Mr Kearns,"" 

48Mr Florent, who was a solicitor, continued to do some conveyancing work for a Nambucca development. He took instructions from Mr Parkes, and said that he did so because ""Jim Kearns told me that he was Jim Kearns' representative and also the representative of the Equitable Insurance Group"". 

49In a Deputy Chairman's report to the Equitable Group for a board meeting on 23 November 1994 the appellant said - 

""I am completing due diligence on the Nambucca Group of Companies which operates in the Coffs Harbour area of New South Wales. This Group has grown haphazardly but consists of hotels, subdivisional real estate, miscellaneous properties and a loan book. I have arranged the sale of one of the hotels, have reorganised the management (halved the staff) of the better hotel to make it profitable and I am reorganising the real estate as a property group (for 'liquidation' to cash for lending). 

I believe that through the Nambucca Group (which is now effectively under my control) we can develop a business in Australia as a regional finance group. I have had some discussions with Colin Grady as to his heading up this Group as I feel it will acquire similar strengths to those that he showed in New Zealand in rebuilding our north island operations"" 

50It was not challenged on appeal that the appellant caused Nambucca, or Lawnkin or Teamcask, to pay the sums of money to Snoco. The causation itself could go to control of Nambucca by the appellant, and when the payment involved one of the directors it could go to the director acting in accordance with the appellant's directions. The Nambucca $50,000 and the Lawnkin $50,000 were paid by cheques signed by Mr Phillip Hall on the instructions of Mr Parkes, from the other evidence as the appellant's representative. 

51The appellant's assumption of the office of trustee did not of itself give him control of Nambucca, but it was an indicium of his dominance in the Nambucca Group's affairs and was seen by the Messrs Hall as occasion to act as the appellant instructed. So also was the appellant's holding of the share transfers and ability to complete them as he wished occasion for the directors to act as he instructed. Going beyond those matters, there was direct evidence from the Messrs Hall that they deferred to the appellant's directions or instructions, and in the report of 23 November 1994 the appellant himself asserted that the Nambucca Group was effectively under his control. It was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was a correct assertion, through the directors of Nambucca being accustomed to act in accordance with the appellant's directions or instructions. 

Ground 11 

52Count 7 was more fully - 

""7. On 5 May 1995 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales dishonestly obtain from Betty Bohannon for Nambucca Investments Pty Limited a valuable thing, namely a cheque in the sum of $20,000 drawn on the account of V & B Bohannon at Advance Bank, North Sydney, by deception, namely by falsely representing to Betty Bohannon that the said sum of $20,000 would be invested pursuant to a prospectus in Equitable Life Insurance Company Ltd ('Equitable Life') for the purchase of insurance bonds, at a time when he knew that no investment would be made in insurance bonds in Equitable Life contrary to section 178BA Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) ('the Bohannon count')."" 

53The appellant accepted that Mrs Bohannon provided a cheque for $20,000 to him pursuant to representations by him that the funds would be invested in two insurance bonds in Equitable, upon the basis of a prospectus issued by Equitable and provided by the appellant to Mrs Bohannon. The ground was concerned with the falsity of the representation. It was submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant knew that the representations as to investment in insurance bonds were false when made other than the subsequent dealing with the money by payment to Nambucca, and that ""the weight of evidence is that he had nothing to do with dealing with the funds ... in a manner inconsistent with those representations"". 

54A submission expressed in terms of ""the weight of the evidence"" does not properly reflect the approach required of this Court, see The Queen v Nguyen above. 

55Mrs Bohannon's cheque was made out to the trust account of Mr Florent. She gave evidence that the appellant told her to make the cheque out to Mr Florent's trust account because the money was to be deposited in the trust account until released by Mr Florent for the purpose of acquiring the insurance bonds. The cheque was paid into Mr Florent's trust account on 12 May 1995. The money was paid out to Nambucca on the same day. 

56Mr Florent gave evidence that the appellant brought the cheque to his office, and that in the presence of the appellant he telephoned Mrs Bohannon. He said that this occurred on 5 May 1995. Mrs Bohannon said that she and her husband ""wanted to go ahead with the insurance bonds for their grandchildren"", and that he could deposit the cheque into his trust account and then draw a cheque ""to who [the appellant] nominated"". The appellant nominated Nambucca, indicating that ""he would then transfer the funds from Nambucca over to Equitable, because Equitable was funding Nambucca"". Mr Florent told Mrs Bohannon that ""it had to be made out to Nambucca"". She asked why, and the appellant ""basically then elaborated on what I had just said was 'goes into Nambucca, we will transfer it as Equitable is funding Nambucca and we're doing it all through Nambucca'"". 

57Mr Florent drew a cheque to Nambucca. The money remained in Nambucca, and was not transferred to Equitable. It was not invested in insurance bonds in Equitable. 

58If the jury accepted Mr Florent's evidence, it was undoubtedly open to them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the representations made by the appellant to Mrs Bohannon were knowingly false, and that the cheque was obtained for Nambucca and the appellant knew that it would not be invested in insurance bonds. In the appellant's submission, however, Mr Florent's evidence was undermined by other evidence, namely - 


Mrs Bohannon's evidence was that on 5 May 1995 the appellant was at her house with her and her husband, when he obtained the cheque; it was the day after her birthday; 

Mrs Bohannon denied that she ""authorise[d] Mr Florent to withdraw that money and deposit it with Nambucca Investments""; and 

on 15 May 1995 Mrs Bohannon wrote to Mr Florent's assistant, Mrs Duncan, ""I should have 'phoned you on Friday authorising you to put the cheque for $20,000 into a trust for our two grandsons, but I got distracted and completely forgot about it"", and gave birthdates of the grandchildren. 

59The appellant submitted that ""the essential elements of the conversation alleged by Mr Florent"" were denied by Mrs Bohannon, and that the conversation was not consistent with the letter of 15 May 1995; further, that Mrs Bohannon was likely to have accurately recalled 5 May 1995 as the day after her birthday, and the day the appellant was at her house collecting the cheque. He submitted, in substance, that Mr Florent's evidence of the appellant instructing that the money be paid to Nambucca could not be accepted, and that Mr Florent had paid the money out to Nambucca without instructions. 

60There is no substance in these matters. The cheque was paid into Mr Florent's trust account on 12 May 1995, and the jury could readily conclude that he was in error as to the date on which the appellant was in his office. Mrs Bohannon's denial must be seen in context: to her, the money was being paid to Equitable, and any agreement to Mr Florent paying it to Nambucca was only as a step to payment to Equitable. It was readily open to the jury to consider that she did not deny ""the essential elements of the conversation alleged by Mr Florent"", and to regard the letter of 15 May 1995 as referring, in Mrs Bohannon's mind and as she said in her evidence when asked about it, to putting the money into ""an insurance trust"", meaning the purchase of the insurance bonds. 

Ground 13 

61For ground 13 further evidence was put before this Court, namely - 


an affidavit of the appellant sworn 21 October 2010; 

a bundle of Judicial Commission documents, as to the documents dated 5 May, 6 July and 4 August 2004 as evidence of the facts and as to the remaining documents as communications to and from the Judicial Commission; and 

an affidavit of Ms Kay Marinos sworn 19 November 2010. 

62The appellant was cross-examined on and beyond his affidavit. The Judicial Commission documents were concerned with complaint by the appellant against the trial judge by reason of his sleeping during the trial. Ms Marinos was not cross-examined. 

63The appellant relied on Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; (2008) 236 CLR 358. He submitted that the facts were ""sufficiently similar to those in Cesan v The Queen ... to warrant the same approach being adopted in this case and accordingly to allow the appeal for the same reasons"". 

64In Cesan v The Queen the evidence was described at some length in the reasons of French CJ at [23]-[45]. The fact finding by Basten JA in this Court was summarised by his Honour at [58], and evidently accepted, and his Honour said at [94]-[95] - 

""[ 94] The trial judge was asleep on a number of occasions on the 11 days when evidence was being given. He slept at least once on most of those days and on some days on two or three occasions. Some of the sleep episodes, possibly between two and five, lasted from 10 to 15 minutes. Most lasted between two and 10 minutes. The judge's sleeping was accompanied by heavy breathing on a number of occasions and he snored when Cesan was giving his evidence. This was disruptive and caused Cesan to look around at the trial judge. The judge also slept through parts of Mas Rivadavia's evidence. The jury was distracted by the judge's sleep episodes and some of the jury members found his behaviour amusing and even emulated it. 

[95] The fact that counsel at the trial did not draw the matter to the judge's attention does not, on the evidence in this case, appear to be based upon any assessment that the judge's conduct did not matter. Rather, it seemed it had been based on the defeatist proposition that nothing could be done."" 

65Gummow J referred at [105] to ""[t]he evidence which was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal"". It is not clear whether this is a reference to the findings by Basten JA, or to the summary next mentioned in the joint judgment of Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. 

66Their Honours said at [115] - 

"" [115] All members of the Court of Criminal Appeal accepted that, as Grove J put it, 'the probability [was] that, from time to time, the judge was ""nodding off"" and on other occasions, notably when he was heard to snore, was asleep in a real and practical sense'. And all members of the Court of Criminal Appeal accepted the evidence of Mr Cesan that, during his cross-examination, the trial judge was heard to snore and that, as a result, some members of the jury 'were looking at the judge and not [Mr Cesan] or the prosecutor' and that some 'looked surprised and others were smiling'."" 

67The appellant represented himself at the trial. As earlier noted, it extended over some ten weeks. 

68The appellant said in his affidavit that - 


from time to time when the Crown Prosecutor was examining witnesses he would occasionally note a lengthy pause in the proceedings, causing him to look up from making notes of the evidence, and that on some of those occasions he observed that the judge appeared to be asleep (para 3); 

the pauses commenced approximately 4 days into the trial and mainly in the afternoon, and were limited to occasions when the Crown Prosecutor was on her feet in the afternoon (para 3); 

the pauses were not every day, and over the course of the trial he ""observed this happen"" once or twice a week (para 3); 

on occasion when one of these breaks occurred he noticed a juror touch another juror on the shoulder ""and direct her attention toward Judge Dodd, who appeared to me to be asleep, and they would both grin and giggle to themselves"" (para 5); 

""On occasions other adjacent jurors would appear to me also to take note of Judge Dodd's sleeping as a result of the actions of these two jurors"" (para 6); 

he occasionally observed that when the judge's associate noted the pause or the actions of the jury she would take actions to waken the judge (para 7); 

""Due to the volume of documents called into evidence during the examination of Crown witnesses these periods of apparent sleep did not last, on my observation, for extended periods, usually in the order of minutes, but became more frequent as the trial drew on"" (para 8); 

the judge ""seemed fully awake and involved when I was cross-examining witnesses"" (para 9); and 

when a tape recording of an ASIC record of interview was played for some hours on 31 October and 1 November 2002, and was played on another day, the judge ""appeared to sleep for lengthy periods and I observed that some jurors (including but not limited to the two young members mentioned earlier) to at first find the Judge's demeanour amusing and later to display no apparent interest in listening to the playing of the record of interview, talking and laughing amongst themselves"" (para 11). 

69The appellant said that he did not think it was his role to draw attention to the apparent sleeping during the presentation of the Crown evidence, and that he ""wasn't game enough to do it myself"". He said that he did not refer to the sleeping during the hearing or in his closing address ""because I didn't want to get [the judge] offside"". 

70Before referring to the cross-examination of the appellant, it is convenient to note the three documents in the Judicial Commission documents standing as evidence of the facts and the affidavit of Ms Marinos. 

71In March 2004 the appellant wrote to the Judicial Commission concerning the judge sleeping, and on 25 April 2004 he made a formal complaint. The complaint was investigated, and the Commission determined that it was established and that it should be classified as minor pursuant to s 30(2) of the Judicial Officers Act 1986 (NSW) and referred to the Chief Judge. 

72One document was a file note of a conversation on 6 July 2004 between an officer of the Judicial Commission and Fullerton SC, who had been the Crown Prosecutor at the trial. It read - 

""ELIZABETH FULLERTON SC - FORBES CHAMBERS 
9390 7777 (6 JULY 2004) 


Knows the judge well - not in a social sense. 

Appeared before him more than once. 

During the course of a trial he drops his chin, which can give the appearance that he is 'nodding off'. 

When he drops his chin in this way it could appear to an observer that he was asleep. 

If one stops - he will immediately pay attention - he misses absolutely nothing. 

In her experience it does not impact on his ability to concentrate on the evidence. 

He is generally painstaking in his attention to detail and in the Kearn's [sic] trial he provided a very good summing up. 

While he may appear to be asleep at times, she could not say that he was. 

Mr Kearn's [sic] represented himself and the judge assisted him to the full extent that he could. 

Happy to make a formal statement if required."" 

73Another document was a letter from the trial judge to the Judicial Commission dated 5 May 2004, responding to a letter from the Judicial Commission which was not in evidence but apparently conveyed the appellant's formal complaint. That complaint had included that the judge ""was often asleep during the afternoon for periods of approximately 15-45 minutes and on some occasions either Counsel for the Prosecution or the Defendant had to wait for his Associate ... to make sufficient noise to wake him up so that he could address a question of evidence/procedure"". 

74It is sufficient to note from the trial judge's letter - 

""I do not believe I fell asleep on the bench during Mr Kearns' trial. I was not 'often asleep during the afternoon for periods of approximately 15-45 minutes'. I did not have to be woken to address questions of evidence or procedure. I do not believe that any action or behaviour on my part affected adversely the jury's understanding of the case or the outcome for Mr Kearns. 

... 

I suggest that the possibility that a judge would be allowed to be clearly asleep or even suspected to be asleep by the parties for 15-45 minutes during a trial is bordering on preposterous. At some point at the trial of Mr Kearns I believe I adopted the practice of taking a short break at about 3 pm, primarily for the jury's benefit. I suggest that practice alone makes it highly unlikely that I was asleep for up to 45 minutes in the afternoons. 

I do not deny that during some trials there is a danger of sleep, either due to tiredness or boredom or a combination of both. I have a variety of strategies to deal with that danger. One of them is to tell my associate to make sure that I do not go to sleep during what I know will be trying periods in a trial. I have no doubt that to this end at some times during Mr Kearns' trial my then associate passed notes to me and occasionally tapped the bench or made other slight noises. This was not on the basis that the parties had to wait for her to make sufficient noise to wake me up so that I could address a question of evidence or procedure."" 

75The third document was another letter from the trial judge to the Judicial Commission dated 4 August 2004, responding to another letter from the Judicial Commission which was not in evidence. Specifically as to the appellant's trial, the judge wrote - 

""As to Mr Kearns' complaint, I expressed myself in part in terms of 'belief' as opposed to absolute denial because his trial took place a considerable time ago and I do not have a detailed recollection of every day of it. But the more I think about it and the more I recollect the more convinced I become that I am correct in my belief that I did not fall asleep during the trial even for seconds. As to the gravamen of his complaint, I assert absolutely that I have never been asleep on the bench for 15-35 minutes. For one thing, during his trial there were a large number of documents admitted into evidence both for the Crown and in his own defence case and a large number of documents marked for identification. Pronouncing upon those as they arose sprinkled thoughout the case would have kept anyone awake most of the time. For another, some afternoons were taken up with Mr Kearns being on his feet, cross-examining one or other of the witnesses. I assert absolutely that when he was on his feet I was not asleep. 

As I recollect, I had to deal with a number of Crown objections from time to time. I recollect that Mr Kearns had difficulty, particularly some afternoons, in formulating his questions. On at least one such occasion or possibly more he searched among his papers, literally wandering from one file to another unsuccessfully. I believe I may have given him a short adjournment on at least one such occasion to collect his material and his thoughts. It may be that I adjourned early one afternoon, either for that purpose or because he was not feeling well. On occasion he would, in the course of cross-examination, seek the Crown's assistance in locating or checking documents. I believe the transcript (which I do not have) will show some but not all of this. It will not show his physical movements nor will it record all of the long pauses between questions that sometimes occurred. It will probably not record the fact of his consultations from time to time with the Crown. It will record my dealing with questions of evidence and procedure as they arose and my belief is that the transcript will record my dealing with those matters promptly and with a full understanding of what has gone before. 

Mr Kearns himself gave evidence over 4 days. I assert absolutely that I was not asleep while he gave evidence. I believe that I gave him what assistance I properly could in the presentation of his evidence. On a further day Mr Kearns called 2 witnesses in his defence case. I assert absolutely that I was not asleep while he was presenting his case through those witnesses. 

Addresses were made over 4 days. I assert absolutely that I was not asleep while the Crown or Mr Kearns was addressing the jury. I know that I listened to Mr Kearns for one day and part of the next day attentively. I then commenced summing up immediately and that continued over the next 2 days. 

Quite frankly I do not know where I could possibly have got the opportunity to go to sleep during Mr Kearns' trial."" 

76Ms Marinos instructed Ms Fullerton during the trial. She sat at the bar table, assisting with documents and taking notes. She said that the Judicial Commission file note of Ms Fullerton's comments ""accurately reflects my observations during the trial regarding his Honour"", and that to the best of her recollection she did not observe that the judge appeared to have fallen asleep nearly every afternoon, was often asleep nearly every afternoon, was often asleep for periods of approximately 15-45 minutes, or slept during the prosecution's examination in chief. She also said - 

""10. I am also aware of the specific allegations made in the applicant's most recent affidavit sworn on 21 October 2010. With reference to the specific allegations set out in: 

(i) paragraph 3 - to the best of my recollection I did not observe the judge to sleep as described by the applicant, or at all. 

(ii) paragraphs 5 and 6 - to the best of my recollection I cannot recall observing any jurors behaving in the manner as described by the applicant. As stated above, I was seated at the bar table, closer to the jury box than the applicant. 

(iii) paragraph 11 - to the best of my recollection I did not observe the alleged conduct of Dodd DCJ nor of the jurors, as described by the applicant. A copy of an edited version of the transcript of the applicant' record of interview was tendered as part of Exhibit C2, and each juror was provided with a copy before the tapes of the interview were played (see trial transcript AB V5 at 1075)."" 

77It will be apparent that the complaint to the Judicial Commission of often sleeping during the afternoon for periods of approximately 15 to 45 minutes differs from the evidence in the appellant's affidavit. The principal differences between that evidence and the appellant's communications with the Judicial Commission were - 


In a letter of 17 March 2004 the appellant said that during his trial ""it did appear Judge Dodd had fallen asleep nearly every afternoon and often there would be a delay (much to the amusement of the jury) while we waited for his associate ... to surreptitiously take steps to wake him up""; this did not confine the sleeping to during the Crown case, and ""nearly every afternoon"" was more frequent than once or twice a week. 

In the formal complaint the appellant said that the judge ""was often asleep during the afternoon for periods of approximately 15-45 minutes and on some occasions either Counsel for the Prosecution or the defendant had to wait for the Associate ... to make sufficient noise to wake him up so that he could address a question of evidence/ procedure""; apart from frequency, this asserted longer periods of sleeping. 

In the communications to the Judicial Commission the appellant made no specific reference to sleeping during the playing of the tape recording of the ASIC record of interview. 

Save for the general reference in the letter of 17 March 2004 to the amusement of the jury in those communications, the appellant did not refer to occasions of the jury's notice of and reaction to the apparent sleeping. 

78These matters were taken up in the cross-examination of the appellant. 

79The appellant affirmed his evidence that the sleeping was in the afternoons, when the Crown Prosecutor was leading evidence, one or two times a week. He said that a pause would cause him to look up, and his observation of the jury would lead him to the judge. He agreed that the judge ""would be alert and proceedings would continue"". 

80The appellant said that he was talking of minutes, not of twenty or forty-five minutes. He agreed that what he wrote to the Judicial Commission about forty-five minutes was not accurate; ""No it was just my attempt to bring the whole thing to their attention for them to address it"". What he wrote about counsel for the prosecution or the defendant having to wait for the judge to wake up was also not accurate - 

""I was trying to draw the attention of the Judicial Commission to what I considered a serious sort of miscarriage if you like that they should address. I didn't, I thought once they got that information they would get it from other people. It was not just in regard to my trial, it was a general problem."" 

81The appellant also agreed that telling the Judicial Commission it was nearly every afternoon was not accurate, and that he ""exaggerated the frequency"". He agreed also that he exaggerated the length of time and exaggerated ""that it had anything to do with you being on your feet"". 

82The appellant agreed that he said nothing to the Judicial Commission about the playing of tapes; he was unable to agree that there was only one afternoon spent playing a tape. He agreed that he had not said to the Judicial Commission that the jury was distracted from listening to the evidence. Importantly, he said, ""I don't know whether I would say that [the sleeping] has distracted them from listening to the evidence"". 

83In my opinion, the account given by the appellant in his affidavit should not be accepted. He submitted to the effect that the differences from what was said to the Judicial Commission favoured its acceptance, because he could have tailored his evidence to match the earlier complaints; this, however, is odd reasoning, particularly when the assertion of sleeping for up to forty-five minutes would plainly not survive examination. There is no reason to give greater credence to the cut-down account than to an admittedly exaggerated account given not for accuracy, but to excite the Judicial Commission's interest. The appellant's credibility is significantly damaged. 

84It is not irrelevant that the 17 March 2004 letter to the Judicial Commission shows that the appellant had been told by an acquaintance prior to the trial that the judge ""goes to sleep most afternoons during criminal trials, you should get that on the record"", and that he was game enough to make a bias application to the trial judge although fearful that it would put the judge offside; this casts doubt on why, if there was the extent of jury distraction of which he gave evidence, he did not get the sleeping on the record. The assertion in para 11 of his affidavit that jurors displayed no apparent interest in listening to the playing of the record of interview is particularly at odds with the appellant's reticence in his oral evidence to say that the sleeping had distracted the jury from listening to the evidence. 

85In other respects doubt is cast on the appellant's evidence. He said that the pauses when the Crown Prosecutor was on her feet commenced approximately four days into the trial, but on days 4, 5, 6 and 7 the appellant was cross-examining Mr Phillip Hall. Only on five days was the Crown leading evidence during the whole of the afternoon, and on those occasions there were many documentary tenders. Further, the tape recording of the ASIC record of interview was not played on the afternoon of 1 November 2002, although it may be that the appellant had not intended to attribute the tape recording sleeping to afternoons. 

86There is no evidence before the Court, which I accept, that his Honour was asleep on any occasion. Further, when regard is had to the file note of the conversation with Ms Fullerton, and to the affidavit of Ms Marinos who was not cross-examined, I am not satisfied that there was more than occasional appearance that the trial judge was asleep; but upon the pause the trial judge (as the appellant agreed) ""would be alert and proceedings would continue"". I do not accept that there was the jury reaction of grinning and giggling, or when the tape recording was played of distraction from listening, as asserted in the affidavit. 

87The facts in the present case are markedly different from the facts in Cesan v The Queen . It is nonetheless necessary to address whether there was a miscarriage of justice on the facts in this case. 

88In Cesan v The Queen French CJ said at [93] that ""[i]f by reason of sleep episodes or serious inattention, the reality or the appearance exists that a trial judge has substantially failed to discharge his or her duty of supervision and control of the trial process in a trial by jury, then enough has been made out to establish a miscarriage of justice"". His Honour concluded - 

"" ... that there was a miscarriage of justice by failure of the judicial process. It was constituted by the judge's substantial failure to maintain the necessary supervision and control of the trial. Further, his conduct created a distraction during the trial process. In particular it distracted the jury and led at least some of the members of the jury to regard the judge with amusement,"" (at [96]) 

89His Honour's conclusion was amplified in his consideration of the application of the proviso - 

"" [97] It could not be said in this case that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice within the meaning of the proviso to s 6(1). The judge's conduct had a discernible distracting effect on the jury. The reaction of some of the jury members raised a real question about the extent to which they would have attended to the evidence and accorded to the judge's directions the respect and attention they required. The Court of Criminal Appeal was in no position to assess these imponderables. The nature of the miscarriage of justice which occurred put such inquiry beyond its reach. Further, this is a case in which the miscarriage of justice was substantial because it created the appearance of injustice which could not be cured by the Court of Criminal Appeal forming the opinion that a reasonable jury would have convicted the appellants in any event."" 

90Gummow J expressed the occasion for the miscarriage of justice - 

""[105] The superintendence of the trial by the trial judge required him to ensure that the jury was not distracted from paying full attention. The evidence which was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal showed both that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence and that the very source of the distraction was the sleeping judge."" 

91The joint judgment of Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ referred at [112] to a miscarriage of justice ""because the trial judge did not exercise that degree of supervision of the proceedings which would ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that the jury paid attention to all of the evidence as it was given"". Their Honours later said - 

""[116] The importance of the evidence given in the Court of Criminal Appeal by Mr Cesan was that it showed that during the cross-examination of one of the two accused on trial at least some members of the jury were not paying attention to the evidence being given. And the findings made by all members of the Court of Criminal Appeal showed that the distraction that occurred during Mr Cesan's cross-examination was probably no isolated incident. There were other substantial periods of time during the trial when the trial judge was asleep and it follows, as Basten JA rightly concluded, that it is probable that the attention of members of the jury was distracted from other evidence being adduced because the trial judge was asleep. And because the trial judge was asleep, no step was taken to refocus the jury's attention upon the evidence. 

... 

[118] As noted earlier in these reasons, in considering whether there was a miscarriage of justice at the trial, attention must focus upon the respect or respects in which it is said that there was some departure from the proper conduct of the trial, rather than upon the cause of the departure. That is why, in the present cases, to focus only upon the fact that the trial judge fell asleep during some parts of the trial diverts attention from identifying whether there was some miscarriage. 

[119] What is important, in these cases, is that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence. And it was upon the assessment of all of the evidence led at trial that the jury's verdict had to be founded. The repeated distraction of the jury from attending to the evidence at various stages of the trial, including when one of the accused was giving his evidence, constituted a miscarriage of justice. 

[120] Ensuring that the jury is not distracted from paying full attention to its task is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge. If trial counsel is concerned that members of the jury cannot give, or are not giving, proper attention during the trial, it will be for counsel to raise that issue with the trial judge. Ordinarily, if the trial judge does not act of his or her own motion, and if trial counsel says nothing, an appellate court will not later be able to conclude that the jury did not pay attention to the evidence that was led. In particular, proffering the opinion of one or more observers about whether the jury appeared to be paying attention to proceedings would not ordinarily suffice to show that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The absence of intervention by the trial judge will usually far outweigh the value of any opinion offered by some observer after the trial is over. 

[121] In the present cases, however, the evidence that was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal went beyond the bald assertion of observers that the jury seemed not to have paid attention during the trial. The evidence that was led in the Court of Criminal Appeal showed that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence and was distracted because the trial judge was asleep."" (footnotes omitted) 

92Heydon J adopted the reasons given by Gummow J and by Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. 

93There may be a difference in emphasis between the Chief Justice and the other members of the court. The Chief Justice may have regarded a judge's substantial failure to maintain the necessary supervision and control of the trial as a matter distinct from whether the judge's conduct created a distraction during the trial process, whereas the other judges saw the distraction by the judge's conduct as itself the failure in necessary supervision of the proceedings. 

94Not every minor inattention by a judge or distraction of the jury, however, will bring failure of the judicial process or departure from the proper conduct of the trial amounting to a miscarriage of justice. As was said by French CJ in Cesan v The Queen at [72], ""The courts are human institutions operated by human beings and there must be a margin of appreciation for human limitations. Otherwise the judicial system would be rendered unworkable by the imposition of unachievable standards"". 

95This was a long trial, to which these observations are particularly pertinent. In my opinion, it has not been shown that, by the occasional appearance of sleeping, there was distraction of the jury from attention to the evidence and to the trial judge's directions constituting a miscarriage of justice. 

Order 

96I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 

97LATHAM J : I agree with Giles JA. 

98ROTHMAN J : I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Giles JA. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and with his Honour's reasons for judgment, except on the question of leave to appeal. 

99As a consequence of his Honour's treatment of the facts and grounds for appeal, it is unnecessary to repeat any of the detail, but I can content myself with a comment on two distinct issues. 

Leave to appeal 

100As a member of the Court in GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163, it is appropriate for me to comment, at least briefly, on the issue of the grant of leave. To the reference by his Honour Giles JA to GAR v R (No 1) , supra, should also be added GAR v R (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 164 at [10] and GAR v R (No 3) [2010] NSWCCA 165 at [5]. The three judgments were handed down as a suite of judgments dealing with three distinct appeals that were argued at the same time and relied upon the same issue of alleged ""fresh evidence"". The issue of whether leave to appeal was necessary did not loom large in the submissions of any of the parties in any one of those appeals. Rather, the parties concentrated on whether leave should issue on the merits. Nor did the requirement for leave occupy significant discussion time between the Court and counsel. 

101The earlier provisions of s 474C of the Crimes Act 1900 required the Court ""to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against conviction"". On one view, a person appeals before leave is granted: see s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. By the foregoing section a person appeals under the Act ""with the leave of the court or upon certificate of the judge of the court of trial"" on any ground involving the question of fact alone, a question of mixed law and fact or any other question. Relevantly and most importantly, the Act prescribes that ""a person convicted ... may appeal"" either as of right or by leave or certificate. The grant of leave (or the grant of a certificate by the trial judge) relates to ""any ground of appeal"" which involves questions of fact or mixed law and fact. An appeal by right is against the conviction ""on any ground which involves a question of law alone"". 

102Thus, leaving aside a reference to the Court, such as the present case, any proceeding initiated by an appellant may involve grounds for which there is a right of appeal, grounds for which a certificate of the trial judge has issued and/or grounds for which leave is necessary. It is not all of the ""appeal"" that is of right; it is the ground of appeal that is either of right or requires leave or a certificate. 

103The foregoing analysis renders even more difficult the construction of the relevant provisions. The Court must be extremely cautious in using the Criminal Appeal Rules, promulgated as delegated legislation under the Criminal Appeal Act , as a basis upon which to construe the Act itself. Further, it would seem that the provisions of s 77(1)(b) are more likely to result in the outcome which Giles JA prefers than would a construction of s 474C(1). The reason for that view is that s 77(1)(b) requires that the whole case ""be dealt with as an appeal"", while s 474C(1) of the Crimes Act , and the ancillary provisions thereto, referred to the case being dealt with in the same way ""as if the convicted person had appealed"". To the extent that there is a distinction in those words, the latter provision is more consistent with the continued requirement to obtain leave or a certificate. 

104In most instances, and certainly in this case, the issue is not a live one. If leave were necessary, then, in my view, leave should be granted. 

105Nevertheless, it is necessary, in my view, to deal in a little more detail with the operation of the Criminal Appeal Act and the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. As earlier stated, an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal to overturn a conviction is allowed by s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act . It grants a right to a convicted person to appeal. 

106The use of the word ""may"" in s 5(1) is facultative, it allows an ""appeal"" at the discretion of the person convicted, which, if lodged, must be considered by the Court: Re Coldham; Ex Parte Brideson [1989] HCA 2; (1989) 166 CLR 338 at 347-348. 

107By operation of s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act , the convicted person may appeal to the Court against conviction on any ground involving a question of law alone. Further, by operation of s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act , the convicted person may appeal to the Court, by leave or after grant of a certificate by the trial judge, against conviction, on any other ground. It is unnecessary to deal with sentence appeals under s 5(1)(c), other than to note that they also require leave of the Court. 

108As earlier stated, a document (to use a neutral term) lodged may seek to appeal both conviction and sentence; and may seek to appeal conviction under each or both of s 5(1)(a) and s 5(1)(b). In such a case, the appeal against conviction on a ground or grounds involving a question of law alone is of right and any other ground requires either a certificate of the trial judge or leave of the Court. 

109In that way, the Criminal Appeal Act requires that each ground of appeal be treated quite separately. The Act seems to treat each ground as a separate appeal, which must, procedurally at least, be dealt with separately. The foregoing is not intended to suggest, and does not require, separate proceedings. 

110Once an appeal is lodged, and leaving to one side the requirement for leave, the Court is required to deal with it: see Brideson , supra. For each ground for which leave is necessary, there must be consideration of the grant of leave. 

111In this case, the only basis for the application or petition for review was what has become Ground 13 in these proceedings. The petition for review of the conviction raised only that ground. The Minister of the Commonwealth referred ""the case"" and the Minister of the State referred ""the whole case"" to the Court of Criminal Appeal, each under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . 

112The question of leave depends on the proper interpretation of the phrase ""the whole case"" (s 77(1)(b)) and the meaning of the term ""be dealt with as an appeal"" (s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act ). 

113In that respect, it is necessary to consider the judgments in Mickelberg , supra, Mallard , supra, and JJT , supra. In Mickelberg , the High Court was dealing with an appeal from the Supreme Court of Western Australia in which application was made to admit fresh evidence. The Attorney General of New South Wales, intervening pursuant to the s 78B Notice, submitted that, where the Attorney General possessed a power to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal, then, if fresh evidence could be admitted, it ought not. 

114In Mickelberg , the joint judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ, recited by Giles JA, above, refers to the whole case. But in that case, the ground of appeal was that the fresh evidence disclosed, and otherwise there existed, an unreasonable verdict (as it would now be called). In those circumstances, it must be necessary for the Court of Criminal Appeal to examine all of the evidence (and the whole of the trial) in order to reach a conclusion. 

115Likewise, in Mallard , supra, the High Court was dealing (again in relation to the equivalent Western Australian legislation) with the effect of fresh evidence on the appropriateness of conviction. As a consequence, all of the evidence, ""whether 'new', 'fresh' or previously adduced, in the case against, and the case for the appellant"" is required to be considered: Mallard , supra, at [10], per Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ. 

116In both Mickelberg and Mallard , ""the case"" was the unreasonableness of the verdict and/or miscarriage of justice and required all aspects of the trial to be examined. This is also true in JJT , supra, where there was a ""change in heart"" on the part of one of the witnesses requiring reassessment of the whole evidence. 

117In the case now before the Court, no ground was raised in the petition other than a miscarriage of justice based upon the allegation that the judge was asleep. It was not suggested that any ruling was incorrect. Nor was it suggested that the summing-up was deficient. Further, it was not suggested that the result was unreasonable. The petition raised one matter. The justiciable controversy was whether, because the judge had fallen asleep during the trial, there had been a miscarriage of justice. 

118In resolving that justiciable controversy, it would be necessary to examine the trial, in its entirety, for evidence of inattentiveness or otherwise supporting (or excluding) the allegation of inattentiveness, or any resulting miscarriage. 

119But the controversy is defined by the pleadings, in this case, the petition and the reference. The ""whole case"" is the whole of that controversy. The reference replaces, where it may otherwise have been required, the grant of leave by the Court or the issue of a certificate by the trial judge. 

120After reference, any ground of appeal that is not within the justiciable controversy referred is to be treated in the same way as if it were an appeal under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act . The alternative construction would lead to some anomalies. 

121The Governor or Minister may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with a petition, if the matter complained of has been fully dealt with in the proceedings at trial; has previously been dealt with under the review provisions; or has been the subject of appeal. 

122If, as is suggested by some analyses but not accepted by me, the provisions of the Act mandate the consideration of each and every ground raised at the hearing of the appeal but not in the petition, then no inherent or implied power would entitle the Court to ignore a ground. Of course, if the ground were truly frivolous or vexatious, it would take little or no consideration, but there is a significant difference between, on the one hand, the exclusion from consideration of any issue that the Court is mandated to consider and, on the other hand, the determination that the issue is frivolous or vexatious, as a consequence of which the appeal on that ground would be dismissed. 

123Further, such a construction would lead to the anomalous result, that grounds of appeal could be raised at hearing, and would be required to be dealt with, which grounds would have resulted in the ground not being considered by the Governor or Minister, pursuant to s 77(3) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act . 

124I accept that the foregoing is an interpretation of the legislation that is not universally accepted, and may be against the generally accepted view. But in my view, the Governor or Minister refers the case raised by the petition, and may, in so doing, refer some grounds, but not others. And the Court is required to deal with the whole of the case referred. The ""appellant"" may raise other grounds (i.e. that were not raised in the petition and referred), but the Court is required to deal with such grounds as if it were an appeal proceeding, namely, to the extent necessary, consider leave for each ground not described by s 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act . 

125Ground 13 in these proceedings was the basis for the matter referred by the Attorneys, and each other ground, to the extent that it does not involve a question of law alone, requires leave. 

126As earlier stated, it is unnecessary to determine the issue finally. If leave were necessary, it should be granted. 

Ground 13 

127As already stated, I fully agree with the analysis of Giles JA on the question of facts and all other questions save as to whether leave is needed. 

128The evidence before the Court on this appeal, relevant to Ground 13, is in relatively short compass. The appellant has given a version in the witness box which is at odds with the version given on earlier occasions and, frankly, none of his versions can be believed. 

129As a consequence, there is no evidence before the Court, which can be accepted, that his Honour the trial judge was asleep on any occasion. Independent evidence is inconsistent with the assertions of the appellant in that respect (see, particularly, the Affidavit of Ms Marinos, who was not cross-examined). 

130While there is other evidence that his Honour's positioning of his head may have given an uninformed observer the impression that his Honour may be nodding off, that impression was, on the evidence before the Court, disabused by the obvious attentiveness of his Honour to the occurrences in court, including objections to evidence, the tendering of material, and the issues that arose from time-to-time, seemingly at a point in time when his Honour was giving the earlier mentioned impression. 

131I agree with the analysis of Giles JA in this and other regards and with his analysis on all grounds of appeal. For the reasons given by Giles JA, and the further reasons herein, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.

2756974,SMITH v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 110,"Judgment 

1CAMPBELL JA: I agree. 

2RS HULME J: I agree with Hoeben J. 

3HOEBEN J: 
Offence and sentence 
Between 26 August 2009 and 3 September 2009 the applicant was tried by a jury before Acting Justice Mathews upon an indictment that pleaded a count in terms that on 28 June 2008 at Narrabri he did murder Bradley Robert Hoye (the deceased). 

4Before the resumption of the Crown case in the trial, on the morning of 3 September 2009, the applicant was re-arraigned upon the indictment in the presence of the jury. The applicant then pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted the plea to manslaughter in full satisfaction and discharge of the indictment. Pursuant to s157 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 her Honour accepted the plea of guilty, discharged the jury and found the applicant guilty of manslaughter. 

5Manslaughter is an offence contrary to s18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 which has as its maximum penalty imprisonment for 25 years. 

6On 6 November 2009 her Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing 11 May 2009 and expiring 10 November 2013, with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months expiring on 10 February 2016. 

7The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed by her Honour. The grounds of appeal are: 

Ground 1 - The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
Ground 2 - Her Honour erred in her assessment of the degree of threat posed by the deceased. 

Factual background 

8Her Honour set out the factual background in paragraphs [2] - [8] of her Remarks on Sentence as follows: 

""2 The circumstances of the offence are as follows.""' In June 2008, Bradley- Hoye, who was then 32 years old, was living in Narrabri. It seems that on the night of Friday, 27 June, he had had an altercation with a person or group of people in the vicinity of the Tourist Hotel in Maitland Street, Narrabri. He was heavily intoxicated at the time. He returned to his home, not far away, changed his clothes, collected two knives, put on a balaclava and went out looking for the person whom he believed was responsible. 

He returned to the Tourist Hotel shortly after midnight. At about the same time Neil Gibbs, who was a friend of the offender, parked his car outside the Tourist Hotel. The offender and several of his friends were also in the vicinity, having recently left the nearby Caledonia Hotel where they had been drinking for part of the evening. None of them had ever met Mr Hoye before. Even if they had, they would probably not have recognised him, as his head and face were entirely concealed by the balaclava. 

3 Mr Hoye first ran in the direction of Mr Gibbs. He was wielding the knives in the air and saying ""you're that cunt, I'm going to get you, I'm going to cut you up."" Mr Gibbs evaded him and Mr Hoye then turned his attention towards the offender, Ashley Smith. He ran towards him, but Mr Smith threw a can of rum at Mr Hoye, and his companions started to do the same. At about this time a chase developed, which took the group through an arcade which ran between Maitland Street and Tibbereena Street. Mr Gibbs was being pursued by Mr Hoye, who was still wearing his balaclava and wielding his knives. He in turn was pursued by Ashley Smith and his companions. At Tibbereena Street the group turned to the right and in due course ended up outside the Crossing Theatre in the same street. At this point, according to Mr Gibbs, Mr Hoye was still swinging his knives and saying he was going to kill Ashley Smith and his associates. At about this time, Mr Gibbs ran to a nearby tree and broke off a fairly large branch. He ran back to Mr Hoye, raised the branch and told him that he would hit him with it if he, Mr Hoye, did not drop his knives. Mr Hoye raised his hands in the air, as a sign of surrender, and said that he wanted to make a truce. At that point Mr Hoye started to back away, still holding his knives. Also at about that time, one of the other men took the tree branch from Mr Gibbs. Very shortly afterwards it was taken by Ashley Smith. Mr Smith swung the stick with both hands, and struck Mr Hoye in the head on at least two occasions. Mr Hoye fell to the ground. Whilst he was on the ground, Mr Smith again struck him with the stick at least once, and possibly more. He also kicked him around the head until one of his friends pulled him back. It is likely that another of his companions also kicked Mr Hoye once when he was on the ground. 

4 At some stage during this fracas, Mr Smith sustained an injury to the webbing of his left hand between the forefinger and the thumb. This must have been caused by one of Mr Hoye's knives, although there is no clear evidence as to when or how this injury occurred. 

5 The police and ambulance were called to the scene. The first paramedic to arrive, at 12.36am, found that Mr Hoye was not breathing and there was no pulse. Attempts to perform CPR, both at the scene and in hospital, were unsuccessful. At 1.40am life was pronounced extinct. Mr Hoye never regained consciousness after collapsing in Tibbereena Street. 

6 An autopsy performed by Dr Kevin Lee found that the cause of death was inhalation of blood, caused by blunt force head and neck injury. The deceased had sustained extensive injuries to the right side of his face including a complex tripod fracture of the right maxilla, and multiple fractures to the zygomatic bone as well as an oblique fracture of the right lower jaw. These injuries were associated with extensive haemorrhage, particularly within the mouth. 

7 Internal examination revealed a fracture of the skull in the left occipital area. In addition there was extensive bilateral haemorrhage to the muscles at the back of the neck. These injuries were consistent with blows by a hard instrument, or kicks by a person wearing a hard boot, as the offender was at the time. It was the combination of bleeding from these injuries and being profoundly unconscious which led the deceased to swallow and inhale large quantities of blood, thus causing his death. 

8 The plea of guilty to manslaughter was offered by Mr Smith and accepted by the Crown on the basis of excessive self-defence. This was, in the circumstances, an entirely appropriate outcome. By the time Mr Smith inflicted the fatal injuries, Mr Hoye posed no immediate threat whatsoever, either to Mr Smith or to any of his companions. However, Mr Smith had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol that evening. Almost certainly his judgment was seriously impaired. The injury he sustained to his hand, which immediately started bleeding profusely, reinforced his mistaken view that he was at risk and that he had to defend himself and his companions."" 

Remarks on sentence 

9The evidence in the trial was evidence before her Honour on sentence. This was supplemented by documentary evidence tendered during the sentence proceedings and the evidence of the applicant's father. The applicant did not give evidence. Even though he did not give evidence, her Honour noted as part of the background facts that when the applicant spoke to a clinical psychologist, Mr Champion, he had only a patchy memory of the incident and did not know how he obtained the stick with which he struck the deceased. He told Mr Champion that he could not remember kicking the deceased when he was on the ground, although as her Honour found and as the evidence clearly indicated, he undoubtedly did so. 

10In relation to the applicant's subjective case, he was aged 23 at the time of sentence, having been born in March 1986. He was of Aboriginal descent, as were both his parents. He was the fourth of five children and had lived all his life in Wee Waa. He was living there with his parents at the time of the offence. His family background was a supportive one and his parents were highly regarded in the area. 

11On the basis of Mr Champion's two reports, her Honour noted that the applicant had a ""truncated"" education and had tried unsuccessfully to complete year 10 on two occasions. As a result, his employment had been of a manual or unskilled nature, mainly in rural industries. He was working as a cotton picker at the time of the offence. 

12Her Honour found that the applicant had a long history of cannabis and alcohol abuse, having started using cannabis at about the age of 12. His use of cannabis was on a daily basis and on the night of the killing he had used cannabis, as well as consuming a considerable amount of alcohol. The applicant had started drinking alcohol at about the age of 16. Although his consumption was generally moderate, on occasions it was excessive. 

13Her Honour found that in relation to other aspects of his life, the applicant demonstrated a high degree of stability. He had been in a de facto relationship with a young woman for a number of years, which had terminated shortly before the offence. Since then they had reconciled and she had remained supportive of him throughout the proceedings. 

14A matter which her Honour regarded as particularly impressive was that the applicant had an almost non-existent criminal record. The only convictions recorded against him, other than driving matters, related to damage to property and contravening an apprehended violence order which took place at almost the same time as this offence and related to his relationship with his then estranged girlfriend. Her Honour treated the applicant as a person of prior good character. 

15Her Honour characterised the killing of the deceased as a tragedy which should never have happened. She noted that the deceased was heavily affected by alcohol at the time, having a post mortem blood alcohol reading of .195, and that there were traces of amphetamines and methylamphetamine in his blood. This accounted for the deceased's aggressive and belligerent behaviour towards a group of strangers. Her Honour took into account that the applicant was also significantly intoxicated with alcohol and was probably also affected by his cannabis use. As a result, her Honour found that his judgment was very seriously impaired. 

16Nevertheless, a key finding by her Honour was that by the time the applicant struck the deceased with the tree branch, the deceased was already retreating. While he was still holding the knives, he no longer posed any realistic threat to the applicant or his companions. In the particular circumstances of this case her Honour was prepared to treat the applicant's intoxication as a mitigating factor, albeit a minor one. Her Honour took this approach on the basis that the applicant's conduct was an irrational response which was brought about by the effect of alcohol consumption ( Stanford v R [2007] NSWCCA 73). 

17Her Honour accepted that the situation in which the applicant found himself was one which had been thrust upon him against his will. Her Honour regarded that also as a mitigating factor. In particular, her Honour noted that what occurred was very much a spur of the moment action. Her Honour was not able to determine how the branch came into the applicant's possession but found that obtaining it was a spontaneous, as distinct from a considered, act on his part. Her Honour also had regard to the fact that the injury to the applicant's hand was significant and would have bled profusely at the time and would have increased his sense of insecurity. 

18Her Honour considered that those matters were relevant to determining the objective seriousness of the offence. On the negative side, her Honour found that the applicant continued to strike and kick at the deceased, even after he was on the ground, and regarded this as constituting an unnecessary and excessive display of aggression. Taking that and the mitigating circumstances into account, her Honour determined that the case fell within ""the lower range of culpability for manslaughter involving excessive self defence"". 

19In relation to s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , her Honour could find no aggravating factors but did take into account some further mitigating factors. In that regard, her Honour noted that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. She also found that the applicant had shown remorse for his actions as represented by his plea of guilty. Finally, her Honour took into account the applicant's age, i.e. that he was only 22 when the offence was committed. 

20In relation to the plea of guilty, her Honour found that the applicant was entitled to a 10 percent discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. 

21In passing sentence her Honour summarised her conclusions as follows: 

""31 The maximum sentence for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. Actual sentences can vary between a non-custodial outcome at one extreme and a sentence approaching the maximum at the other. The present offence is in the lower range of objective seriousness for manslaughter and was committed by an offender who has a number of mitigating factors in his favour. Nevertheless, it cannot be forgotten that the offence involved the unnecessary and violent taking of another person's life."" 

The appeal 
Ground 1: The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
Ground 2: Her Honour erred in her assessment of the degree of threat posed by the deceased. 

22It is appropriate to deal with these grounds of appeal together, since each ground raises the same issue. 

23The applicant's basic submission is that her Honour did not have due regard to the degree of threat posed by the deceased to the applicant and others in the group, even though he might no longer have presented the same threat to Mr Gibbs. 

24The Court was provided with detailed references to the transcript of the evidence at trial with a view to establishing that although the deceased had raised his hands in the air as a sign of surrender and was backing away, he was still holding the knives in a threatening way. 

25The applicant submitted that in those circumstances, it was reasonable for him to conclude that his life was still at risk as were the lives of his friends. 

26The applicant submitted that a proper analysis of the evidence by her Honour would have demonstrated that the blows struck while the deceased was on his feet were not criminal but were excused by the law of self-defence. He submitted that such an approach was not inconsistent with the guilty plea, i.e. the plea would amount to an acceptance that the blow with the stick and the two kicks to the head while the deceased was on the ground substantially contributed to his death, were done with an intent to cause grievous bodily harm and were not a reasonable response to the circumstances as the applicant perceived them. 

27The applicant submitted that her Honour did not approach the facts in this way and that it was clear from her remarks on sentence that she treated all the applicant's acts after he obtained possession of the branch as criminal. The applicant submitted that had her Honour properly assessed the evidence, she would have concluded that the culpability for any blows delivered by the applicant to the deceased while the deceased was standing was ""extremely slight"". 

28The applicant submitted that on a proper understanding of the evidence, and by reference to the applicant's very strong subjective case, it was clear that the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive. This was particularly so when her Honour had assessed the offence as being of low objective seriousness. 

29I do not accept that her Honour did not accurately summarise and appreciate the effect of the evidence concerning the actions of the applicant. It was well open to her Honour to make the findings which she did. The two sober members of the group, i.e. Mr Gibbs and Ms Dicks, made it clear that after Mr Gibbs threatened the deceased with the branch, the deceased said on a couple of occasions that he wanted to make a truce, lowered his hands and commenced backing away. He still held the knives but had lowered his hands from the threatening stance he had originally adopted when confronting Mr Gibbs. At that point in time, the deceased was facing a group who had chased him and who were now standing around him in a threatening manner (T.319.10). 

30In making her assessment of the evidence, her Honour had an advantage which this Court does not. Her Honour saw and heard the witnesses give their evidence. In setting out her summary of the factual background, her Honour was relying not only upon the transcript but on her assessment of the various witnesses. 

31Once it is accepted that it was open to her Honour to make those findings of fact in relation to how the offence occurred, the primary basis for the applicant's appeal falls away. It is clear from her Honour's findings that from the time when the deceased indicated that he wanted a truce and commenced backing away from the group, he no longer presented a threat to the applicant. It was against those background facts that the applicant struck the deceased on the head on at least two occasions and then struck him on the head at least once more after he had fallen to the ground and kicked the head until he was pulled away. 

32The findings made by her Honour were inconsistent with any conclusion that the response of the applicant was a reasonable response to the conduct of the deceased at the time of the fatal blows , even allowing fully for the circumstances of the previous aggressive conduct of the deceased and the intoxicated state of the applicant. Such findings, while still being consistent with her Honour's conclusion that the case fell within the lower range of culpability for manslaughter involving excessive self defence, are not consistent with the proposition that the culpability of the applicant was ""extremely slight"" in relation to the blows delivered by him when the deceased was still standing. 

33All of the other matters referred to by the applicant in his submissions, in particular his strong subjective case, were fully analysed and given appropriate weight by her Honour. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the sentence passed was well within the legitimate exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. 

34This emerges clearly when one takes into account the undisputed objective elements in the offence. 

(i) It involved the taking of a human life. 

(ii) There was a substantial level of excess involved in the offence, e.g. the nature of the weapon used, and the number and location of the blows and kicks to the head. 

(iii) That some of the blows were struck as the deceased lay helpless on the ground. 

(iv) At the time of the first blow, the deceased was backing away and was asking for a truce. 

35It follows that the grounds of appeal have not been made out. 

36The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

		13 May 2011",2011-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2756977,Inspector Nicholson v Pymble No 1 Pty Ltd & Molinara (No 3) [2011] NSWIRComm 59,"Judgment re costs 

1The prosecutor, Inspector Anthony Nicholson of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales, brought proceedings against the defendants, Pymble No 1 Pty Ltd and Silvio Molinara, alleging certain breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000. In judgment delivered on 12 November 2010, I found each of the defendants not guilty and reserved costs. (See Inspector Nicholson v Pymble No 1 Pty Ltd & Molinara (no 2) [2010] NSWIRComm 151.) 

2By arrangement with the parties, the question of costs was to be dealt with by way of written submissions. 

3Each of the defendants was unrepresented and the carriage of the proceedings was conducted by Mr Molinara in his capacity as a director of the corporate defendant and in person in connection with the proceedings brought against him. 

4In a document entitled ""Application for Costs Order"", Mr Molinara sought orders for costs on an indemnity basis. In addition, he sought orders for what he described as ""special damages"", ""economic loss"", ""pecuniary damages"" and disbursements. 

5These latter orders were sought in some way to compensate the defendants for the financial and emotional burden imposed upon them by the proceedings, exacerbated by straitened financial circumstances and the fact that they could not afford legal representation. 

6There was no quantification made of any of the amounts claimed. 

7In written submissions in reply, the prosecutor pointed out that the Court only has before it the question of costs of the proceedings and this is the only matter that is the subject of the leave to apply that was granted. I agree with this submission. Whether and to what extent either or both defendants wish to maintain some other claim for the payment of monies apart from costs will be a matter for them, such claim obviously having to be made independent of the current proceedings before the Court. 

8In terms of costs, I agree with the submission of the prosecutor that there is no basis for the awarding of indemnity costs having regard to the nature of the proceedings instituted by the prosecutor and the manner in which they were conducted before the Court. 

9I recently had occasion to examine the circumstances in which a defendant who successfully defended a prosecution brought under the Occupational Health and Safety Act might be entitled to an order for costs in Inspector Wayne James v Justin James Ryan (No 2) [2010] NSWIRComm 63. Relying upon the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59; (1991) 70 CLR 534, I concluded that 

a defendant who has been successful in having a criminal charge dismissed should in general terms be entitled to a costs order against the prosecutor. In exercising the discretion to award or refuse costs, the matter should be regarded by reference to the position of the defendant. 
(At [7]) 

I intend to take the same approach in the circumstances of these proceedings. 

10There is nothing in the manner in which the defendants conducted themselves, on the evidence, that would disentitle them to an order for costs. Accordingly, I would propose to accede to the making of such an order, save for two matters. Firstly, there is no reason, as I have said, why costs should be ordered on an indemnity basis. Secondly, at all times the defendants were self-represented. I agree with the prosecutor's submissions that the defendants should be limited to recovering costs that reflected monies actually disbursed in and about the defence of the proceedings and witness expenses incurred during the conduct of the litigation. Furthermore, I agree with the prosecutor's submissions that the defendants are not entitled to any amount to compensate them for the time and effort spent in the preparation and conduct of the proceedings other than the actual disbursements of witness expenses, which I have indicated. For completeness, I note that the prosecutor cited, in aid of this submission, Cachia v Hanes (1991) 23 NSWLR 304, Cachia v Hanes (1994) 179 CLR 403 and Lawrence v Nikolaidis & Co (2003) 57 NSWLR 355.

2756979,R v Hawi & ors (No 4) [2011] NSWSC 1650,"Judgment 

Judgment on admissibility of evidence of SP conducting surveillance upon Peter Zervas two weeks prior to the airport incident 

1The Crown proposes to adduce evidence from the witness known as SP which is generally to the effect that two weeks prior to the incident at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009 he, and other nominee members of the Comanchero motorcycle club, were directed to carry out surveillance upon certain Hells Angels members, particularly Peter Zervas, the brother of the deceased, Anthony Zervas. The Crown proposes to lead this evidence only in the case against Mr Hawi and Mr Abounader. It is asserted to be admissible against Mr Abounader because he was directly involved in the events. The Crown contends that it is admissible against Mr Hawi because, having regard generally to the hierarchical command structure of the club, the inference is available that such activity would not occur without at least the knowledge, if not the sanction, of the national president. 

2Mr Grant, counsel for the accused Hawi, and Mr Trevallion, counsel for the accused Abounader, have both indicated that they object to the evidence. Counsel for the other Comanchero accused (Messrs Menzies, Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin) also object, even though the evidence is not sought by the Crown to be admitted in their cases. 

3The evidence is that nominee members were called to a meeting at the home of Mr Herb Laupepa, the Comanchero sergeant at arms, about two weeks prior to 22 March 2009. They were shown confidential police documents relating to Hells Angels members which included photographs. There is some evidence suggesting that the Comanchero had an inside source in the Police Department who provided the confidential documents. SP was shown one that concerned Peter Zervas. There was a photograph and an address. The nominees were directed to carry out surveillance in order to determine if the addresses were current. 

4Immediately after the meeting, SP and another nominee travelled to Lakemba to the address indicated for Mr Peter Zervas and lay in wait. Eventually they saw a man arrived by car. SP thought that the man looked like Peter Zervas. A phone call was made to indicate, ""we think we found them"" . There was a return phone call from the accused Abounader who asked them to ""stay where they were"" . Despite that, SP and his companion met up with Abounader, his former co-accused Costa and Aouli (they have pleaded guilty and await sentence) and another Comanchero at a service station in Revesby. 

5Mr Abounader rebuked SP's companion for leaving the address. The ensuing discussion included SP and his companion telling the others that they were ""pretty sure"" that the address was still that of Peter Zervas. The others left and SP later received a call from Mr Abounader who described a car in the same terms as that in which SP had earlier seen Peter Zervas. 

6SP was a participant in the events at the airport on 22 March 2009 and has pleaded guilty and undertaken to give evidence for the prosecution. As a consequence, he is a witness whose credibility is expected to come under attack. The Crown has available certain evidence, which it will adduce if necessary, that it will contend supports that of SP on the present subject. The description SP gave of the photograph of Peter Zervas that he was shown is consistent with the photograph which was current on police files at the time. The person thought to have the contact with an inside source in the Police Department is known to have had an association with a former detective who is under investigation by the Police Integrity Commission for, inter alia, providing confidential police information to others, including motorcycle clubs like the Comanchero. 

7There is, it seems, no evidence to establish the identity of the other Hells Angels members whose photographs and addresses were shown to the other nominee members at the meeting at Mr Laupepa's house and it is not known whether they carried out surveillance as SP did in respect of Peter Zervas. 

8The Crown asserts that the evidence is relevant in the following way. One of the central issues in the trial concerning the accused Hawi and Abounader will be their state of mind when they, and other Comanchero members, approached Hells Angels members in the departure hall. The Crown case is that they had an intention, at least, to assault the Hells Angels. The Crown anticipates that Mr Hawi and Mr Abounader may contend that the approach was either accidental, in that they were lost on their way to the baggage claim area, inadvertent, or otherwise innocent of any criminal intent. 

9The jury will have other evidence from which it will be able to resolve this factual dispute, such as eyewitness accounts, CCTV footage, the evidence of SP as well as that of AL (another accomplice witness) and the general layout of the airport terminal. There is also a proposed agreed fact that there was hostility between the Comanchero and Hells Angels clubs. Notwithstanding this evidence, the Crown says that the evidence of the surveillance upon Peter Zervas a short time before 22 March 2009 will also assist the jury in resolving this factual dispute. The fact that Peter Zervas was known to Mr Hawi and Mr Abounader and was of some interest to them could be regarded by the jury as being inconsistent with any claim that their approach to the Hells Angels in the departure hall was accidental, inadvertent or otherwise innocent. 

10There are a number of problems with this. I very much doubt that the evidence is relevant but, even if it is, its probative value is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. 

11Apparently there is evidence of a proposal that Peter Zervas be ""knocked"" (murdered). That would tend to be a reason for wanting to confirm his address. But the Crown does not propose to lead this evidence. That is understandable. However, it leaves this surveillance evidence as establishing that Comanchero members had some interest in Peter Zervas and a number of other, unnamed, Hells Angels. The fact in issue is the state of mind of Messrs Hawi and Abounader as they came into contact with the Hells Angels in the departure hall. I am unable to see how evidence of a previous unspecified interest in Peter Zervas and other Hells Angels, if accepted by the jury, could rationally affect, either directly or indirectly, the jury's assessment of the probability of the existence in the minds of Messrs Hawi or Abounader of a hostile intention. 

12If the evidence was to the effect that Peter Zervas was a specific target or focal point of hostility by the Comanchero members at the airport on 22 March 2009, the evidence might have some relevance. However, as the Crown case was explained to me by the Crown Prosecutor in the course of her submissions, it does not seem that Peter Zervas was of any greater interest to the Comanchero members than any of the others in the Hells Angels group. True it is that there is evidence of a verbal argument involving him and Mr Hawi at the commencement of the incident. But I do not understand the case to be that the animosity from which this emanated was confined to just Peter Zervas. The animosity extended to all Hells Angels as the agreed fact indicates and the incident near Gate 5 a short time before tends to confirm. 

13All that the surveillance evidence is capable of establishing is that there was prior animosity between the Comancheros and Peter Zervas and other Hells Angels. The agreed fact establishes that. 

14The submissions of various counsel for the accused identified a number of ways in which the evidence could be unfairly prejudicial. Mr Grant submitted on behalf of the accused Hawi that the jury would speculate about what the purpose of the surveillance was and how the Comanchero came to be in possession of confidential police documents. Mr Trevallion on behalf of the accused Abounader submitted that the possible purposes of the surveillance were many but the jury may well conclude that it was for a sinister purpose (which seems to have been the reality). Mr Stratton SC, counsel for the accused Menzies, expressed a concern that even if the evidence is not admitted against his client, it would be difficult for the jury to ignore the evidence no matter what directions were given. The jury might use it as strengthening the Crown's case that the Comanchero accused had an intention to harm or kill the brother of the surveillance target. Mr Driels, on behalf of the accused Potrus, expressed concern about the additional evidence the Crown may lead concerning the source of the confidential police documents. This may introduce into the trial the notion that the Comanchero motorcycle club had a relationship with corrupt police. 

15Some of these concerns are more valid than others but it is unnecessary to consider them in any detail. If the jury is not given any direction about the lack of evidence of the purpose of the surveillance, it is highly likely they will speculate that it was for some sinister purpose and give the evidence greater weight than it deserves when assessing the state of mind of Mr Hawi and Mr Abounader on 22 March 2009. If the jury are directed against engaging in any such speculation, it is highly likely that the direction would simply achieve the opposite of what was intended. 

16If the evidence has any probative value, it is minimal and is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. It is not admissible.

		09 February 2012",2011-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2756994,Monteiro v R; R v Monteiro [2011] NSWCCA 113,"Judgment 

1SIMPSON J : On 9 December 2008 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment that alleged four offences. The first was an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, in circumstances of aggravation (an offence against s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900). The circumstance of aggravation pleaded was that, immediately before the sexual intercourse, the appellant intentionally inflicted on the complainant actual bodily harm. The second offence, pleaded in the alternative to the first, was that the appellant assaulted the complainant thereby causing actual bodily harm ( Crimes Act , s 59(1)). The third offence was of intentional damage to property ( Crimes Act , s 195(1)(a)), and the fourth of stealing specified property ( Crimes Act , s 117). (I will refer to the third and fourth offences collectively as the property offences.) The events the subject of counts 1 and 2 were alleged to have taken place on 2 January 2008. The offences the subject of counts 3 and 4 were alleged in the indictment to have been committed between 3 January and 4 January 2008. 

2The appellant entered pleas of not guilty to each of the first and second counts, and guilty to the third and fourth. A jury was, accordingly, empanelled, and a trial of the first and second charges took place. The appellant was represented by Mr Clive Jeffreys, a solicitor and barrister experienced in the practice of criminal law. 

3On 17 December 2008 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first count. It was, therefore, unnecessary to return a verdict in respect of the second count. 

4On 9 April 2009 Norrish DCJ sentenced the appellant. In respect of the property offences he imposed fixed term sentences of, respectively, 2 years and 8 months and 1 year and 9 months, each to date from 8 January 2008, and the shorter, therefore, to be served concurrently with the longer. 

5On the sexual intercourse without consent count, he imposed a sentence of 11 years, made up of a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months, and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months, to commence on 8 April 2009, and therefore accumulated by 1 year and 3 months on the earlier imposed sentences. The total effective sentence is of 12 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months, commencing on 8 January 2008 and expiring on 7 October 2015, with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months expiring on 7 April 2020. 

6The appellant appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the asserted severity of the sentences imposed in respect of the sexual assault offence and the malicious damage offence. The Director of Public Prosecutions has cross-appealed against the sentence imposed in respect of the sexual assault sentence, asserting that it is manifestly inadequate. 

The grounds of appeal 

7Initially, on appeal, the appellant was represented by senior and junior counsel. A single ground of appeal against conviction was pleaded, that the conviction is, having regard to the evidence, unreasonable and cannot be supported. Written submissions signed by both counsel were provided and have been considered by this Court. 

8Thereafter, the appellant terminated the retainer of his legal representatives, and undertook the conduct of the appeal himself. He added a further ground of appeal against conviction, that he formulated as follows: 

""Breach of Legal Professions Act by Clive Jeffreys, incompetence."" 

9No objection having been raised by the Crown to that additional ground being argued, the Court treated the Notice of Appeal as having been so amended. 

10In support of that ground, and, it seems, the original ground, the appellant filed multiple handwritten documents, some of which were intended to be affidavits, and some submissions. Again, the Crown took no objection to any formal deficiencies in the affidavit evidence, and, in my view, those documents that purport to be affidavits ought to continue to be treated as such, as, to date, they have been. 

11Central to the second ground of appeal was a claim by the appellant that, in a number of respects, the counsel who appeared for him at trial failed to comply with explicit instructions given to him by the appellant. The appellant also claimed that, in other respects, the counsel was incompetent. 

12Because of the assertions made by the appellant concerning the quality of his representation and particularly the asserted failure to comply with instructions, it was necessary that this Court take the unusual step of hearing evidence. That occupied three days in September 2010. 

13In respect of the conviction appeal, evidence was given by the appellant, by Mr Jeffreys (trial counsel) and by Mr Jeffreys' former employed solicitor, Ms Anne Green. Evidence relevant to sentence was also given. I will deal with that when I come to the sentence appeals. 

Background 

14Given the nature of the grounds of appeal, and the argument directed thereto, it is necessary to set out in some detail the relevant facts and circumstances. Compartmentalisation is, however, necessary. Consideration of the first ground of appeal is necessarily confined to the evidence given in the trial. Consideration of the second ground will involve examination of the additional evidence given in the hearing of the appeal. Nevertheless, in the account of the factual circumstances, I will incorporate reference to matters that arise principally in regard to the second ground. 

15I begin with the case the Crown sought to make at trial. What immediately follows, under the next sub-heading, is, unless otherwise indicated, drawn from the evidence in chief given by the complainant. It is not intended to represent any findings of fact. 

The Crown case 

Evidence of the complainant 

16The complainant was born in 1970. In 2007 she lived in an apartment in Birriga Road, Bellevue Hill, Sydney. On an evening in March of that year, after she had been at a hotel with a friend, consuming alcohol, she and her friend encountered the appellant (who she did not previously know), and a male friend of his. After the four had had a pizza, the complainant and the appellant shared a taxi. Both alighted at the complainant's address at Bellevue Hill and the appellant stayed overnight. A sexual relationship developed. In about April, the appellant moved into the apartment. Initially, the complainant thought that she had met ""the man of my dreams"". However, the appellant became ""quite possessive"". He persistently telephoned the complainant, and accused her of associating with other men. Arguments developed. On one occasion, the appellant smashed the complainant's telephone. He began using physical force on the complainant. 

17In June 2007 the complainant became pregnant, but, by agreement between the complainant and the appellant, the pregnancy was terminated. 

18At some time after this termination, the appellant went out with friends, without the complainant. When he returned home he was intoxicated. He had non-consensual penile/vaginal sex with the complainant. This was not the sexual intercourse the subject of the first count on the indictment. The appellant then either went to sleep or passed out. The complainant showered and slept on a couch. A couple of hours later the appellant joined the complainant. She said ""You raped me"". He denied the accusation and said ""Prove it. Where are the marks?"" (T 70). 

19Notwithstanding this event, the relationship continued. The complainant said that this was because the appellant told her that if she reported him to the police, he would ""come after me or my family"" and that she would ""have to live with that"" (T 71). Threats of this nature, she said, were constantly made. 

20In September the complainant was again pregnant. Initially, she and the appellant decided to proceed with the pregnancy. However, on 16 October, the pregnancy was terminated. 

21Throughout the relationship the appellant was both physically and verbally abusive. There were other occasions when he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent. In about September 2007 he pulled out a clump of her hair, and again had sexual intercourse with her against her will (T 72-73). This also was not the subject of the charge on the indictment. On this occasion the complainant contacted police, but did so anonymously. She spoke to a Constable Kylie Westfallen at the Rose Bay Police Station. The complainant said that she made the complaint anonymously because the appellant had told her that, if she went to the police, he would: 

""... go after my family and he'd gut my dad like a fish ..."" (T 75/1-5) 

He threatened her with iron bars, which he thrust towards her, under her chin, while at the same time making threats of assault on her, her father or her brother. This happened more than once (T 76). 

22Eventually, the complainant did disclose her identity to Constable Westfallen, but did not proceed with any action, and signed a notebook entry stating that she was not in fear for her life, and that the appellant would be vacating the apartment that week. She said that she did this because she was frightened of what the appellant would do if he knew that she had been to the police, and that he would know that she had been to the police (T 75) because he had been assisting them with another matter, and therefore had access to information (T 156). She said that after that event, she and the appellant reconciled. (Evidence subsequently given by Constable Westfallen established that the complainant's first contact with her was on 15 October 2007, and the notebook entry was signed on 16 October, the same day as the second termination.) 

23In October, after being threatened with an iron bar, the complainant told the appellant that the relationship was over and asked him to find alternative accommodation. This was shortly before the second pregnancy termination. The appellant did not vacate the premises. The complainant slept on the couch, the appellant in the bedroom. He told the complainant that he was looking for somewhere else to live. The complainant fixed the date of the termination of the relationship as 16 October, the date of the termination of the second pregnancy. 

24These living and sleeping arrangements continued until December. Just before Christmas, the complainant travelled to Goulburn to visit her parents. (Later evidence suggested that this was on 22 December.) While she was in Goulburn, the appellant repeatedly rang her on her mobile telephone. He suggested that he might come to Goulburn to deliver a Christmas card to her parents (who he had never met) and the complainant told him not to do so. Although the complainant had never given the appellant her family's addresses in Goulburn, the appellant came to her sister's house at lunchtime on Christmas day; he did not enter the house. The complainant had a conversation with him outside the house about how he had obtained the address. Initially, he told the complainant he had obtained the address from an internet search; later, he said that he had obtained her parents' address from electoral rolls at a library, that he had gone to that address, and had been given the complainant's sister's address by a neighbour. The appellant's arrival in Goulburn terrified the complainant. She told him to leave. He told her that he had travelled to Goulburn by taxi, which he had paid for on a credit card. The complainant gave him a small amount of money and some food from her sister, which he consumed sitting in the gutter at the end of the driveway. The appellant then left. (The circumstances of this event featured prominently in the appellant's second ground of appeal.) 

The events of 2 January 2008 

25The sexual intercourse offence charged in the indictment was alleged to have been committed on 2 January 2008. 

26The complainant returned to Sydney at about midday on that date. Her parents drove her from Goulburn. Because there was only one set of security keys to the apartment block, the complainant telephoned the appellant and asked him to leave the keys out for her. She told him that it was inappropriate for him to be present when her parents dropped her at the apartment because their relationship was over. Nevertheless, he was present. 

27The complainant had a hair appointment at Bondi Junction for later (4.00pm) that afternoon; it was her intention that her parents would drive her there on their way home. However, the appellant told the complainant that the appointment had been cancelled by the hairdresser and she remained at the apartment. Her parents then left (at about 12.15pm or 12.20pm) and the complainant remained at the apartment with the appellant. The complainant later re-booked the appointment for an earlier time. (In cross-examination it was established that this call was made at 2.46pm.) 

28After farewelling her parents, the complainant walked into the apartment, with the appellant following closely behind her, so closely as to be pushing at her with his body. The complainant walked into the living room, the appellant to the kitchen on the other side of the apartment where the complainant heard him rummaging in the drawers. The appellant turned and pushed towards the complainant, his hand against her face, pushing backwards into the bedroom and on to the bed; he did this with sufficient force that a pair of sunglasses that had been on the back of the complainant's head fell forward onto her face and broke. The appellant was shouting at the complainant. He said: 

""Think you're a smarty do you. Think you can play games with me. You will do what you're told. You will be my girl and we will be having a baby. That slut dog Dunne is off limits and don't think that you won't be getting fucked."" (T 96-97) 

(""Dunne"" was a female friend of the complainant's.) At this time the appellant had a pair of scissors in his hand. As he pushed her on to the bed, he said: 

""Your stupid fucking plastic hair, you think that's better than me, I'll cut it all fucking off."" (T 98) 

29The appellant struck the complainant in the face, in a slapping or cuffing motion. He said: 

""Get them off, get them off"" (T 97/40) 

and pulled her sneakers from her feet. The complainant sought to retreat from him, saying: 

""No, Simon, it doesn't have to be like this, please don't do this."" (T 100/15) 

30The complainant told the appellant that she needed to use the toilet. The appellant said: 

""I don't care, piss the bed."" (T 100/20) 

31The appellant then moved on to the bed, and lay on top of the complainant, his hand over her face, pushing it into the mattress. The complainant was crying. She asked him not to ""do this"". The appellant pulled the complainant's pants off. He told her to take off her dress. She refused. He repeated the instruction to take it off. She struggled, but took off the dress. The appellant was sitting between the complainant's legs, on top of her, alternately pushing and slapping her. He put his hand over her face, preventing her from breathing and screaming. At times he momentarily released his grip to allow her to breathe. She tried to scream. The appellant took a pillowcase, with which he gestured, indicating that he would put it in the complainant's mouth or over her face, and said: 

""Scream again and it will be your last."" (T 101/35) 

32He removed his shorts and with his hand he guided his penis into the complainant's vagina. This was the act of sexual intercourse the subject of the first count on the indictment. The complainant had both hands clenched under her chin. The appellant told her to kiss him. She said that her mouth hurt. He said: 

""Touch my balls while you're being fucked and then I won't kiss you."" (T 102/30) 

He took her hand and placed it on his testicles. 

33After a short time the appellant ejaculated. The complainant again said that she needed to use the toilet - urgently - and the appellant again told her to: 

""piss the bed"" (T 103/15) 

The complainant then gave the following evidence: 

""and then I said, 'well, please, can you get something for me to go to the toilet in."" And he went to the wardrobe and I had a glass jar with my hair ribbons in it and he handed that to me. And I said, 'I'm not going to the toilet in my ribbon jar. Just let me go to the toilet.' And so I started to get up and I was sliding myself on my bottom across the bed to get up and I went to grab my pink sundress so I could put my dress back on and he said, 'You won't be needing that.' And I said, 'Well, Simon, what do you think I'm going to do? You've deadlocked the flat. I can't get out anyway.' And then he said, 'I'm coming with you.' So I went to the bathroom and I went to the toilet and the window in the bathroom was open but he reached over and shut it, shut the window. And then after I had been to the toilet he kind of I guess herded me back to the bedroom. And I was just sitting on the bed and then it was like he completely calmed down. His demeanour completely changed and then he passed me my sundress and he said, 'Okay, you can put this on.'."" (T 103/15-25) 

34She walked back into the bedroom and sat on the bed. The appellant handed her her dress. Her face was hurting, her head was throbbing and her mouth was sore (T 116). 

35The complainant dressed and walked to the living room and sat on the couch. She was feeling giddy and strange. The appellant walked past and asked if she was all right. She said she was not. He gave her a cold pack wrapped in a tea towel. 

36The two then had a conversation about some photographs of a boat that the appellant had on his computer. The complainant said that she was trying to speak ""softy and gently"" to him, because past experience had taught her that this was the best way of curbing violent outbursts on his part (T 118). 

37The complainant examined her face in a mirror. She observed abrasions to her face, and that her lip was swollen. She saw a cut under her left eye where the sunglasses had broken on her face. These constituted the actual bodily harm that was the circumstance of aggravation alleged in the indictment. 

38The complainant walked into the bedroom and saw the scissors on the floor. She kicked them under the bed. She then walked to the telephone, intending to cancel the hair appointment she had earlier made. The appellant demanded to know what she was doing, and set the telephone on loudspeaker. (In cross-examination it was established that this call was made at 2.56pm.) He then told the complainant that he was in love with her, and wanted to marry her and have children with her. He asked why she had stopped loving him. She told him that it was because of his anger and violence, and said: 

""This isn't love"" (T 124) 

gesturing to her face. He said to her: 

""[Name of complainant] this is not violence, you don't know what violence is."" (T 124/25) 

He told her that one day she would meet somebody who would be really violent with her and that she would miss what he (the appellant) did. 

39The complainant then raised the subject of the appellant moving out of the apartment. She suggested looking at an Internet accommodation site, which the appellant did. He located an advertisement for a room to let in a boarding house in Double Bay. At the complainant's suggestion, the appellant telephoned and made an appointment to see the room at 6.00pm that afternoon. The two left the apartment and walked to the address in Double Bay. Before doing so the complainant applied make-up to conceal the marks on her face. The walk to Double Bay took about 20 minutes. 

40They were let in to inspect the room by a male (in later evidence identified as) Peter Smith. After the inspection they walked back to the Birriga Road apartment. Both the appellant and the complainant stayed in the apartment that night. The complainant intended to sleep on the couch, but the appellant told her that she could have the bed. He then joined her in the bed; when she resisted, he said: 

""Oh look I'm not going to touch you, I'm not going to do anything."" (T 130/20) 

They both slept in the bed. 

3 January 

41The following day, 3 January, the complainant rose at about 7.00am, in order to prepare to return to work that day. She later noticed that the appellant had removed the sheets from the bed, and turned on the washing machine. She presumed, but did not see, that he had washed the bed linen (T 135). She packed an overnight bag with sufficient clothes for the week, showered and dressed. She did not intend to return to the apartment and told this to the appellant. She told him that she intended to terminate the lease on the apartment. She left the apartment alone, carrying her overnight bag, but the appellant followed very closely after her. He caught up with her at the bus stop. He took the overnight bag from her and said: 

""Don't think you won't be coming home tonight."" (T 133/5) 

He carried the bag to the bus stop. The complainant entered the bus. The appellant remained at the bus stop. The complainant began screaming (although her voice was hoarse from screaming the previous day), telling the appellant to return her bag. The complainant left the bus, still screaming, and attempted to retrieve the bag. The appellant asked if she was mad, but eventually surrendered the bag. The complainant again entered the bus, as did the appellant. There followed an argument on the bus, in which the appellant accused the complainant of stealing money from him, and claimed that the contents of the bag were his. 

42The fracas over the bag appears to have lasted for some time, and involved the bus driver, who ordered them to cease or to leave the bus. After they left the bus in Bondi Junction, the complainant, on the instruction of the appellant, opened the bag to demonstrate that she did not have any of his possessions in it. He shouted at the complainant: 

""You want to go down this road, do you?"" 

and: 

""Call the police."" 

He snatched the complainant's mobile telephone from her hand. She took the bag and ran towards her workplace. The appellant followed, and attempted to return the telephone. She refused to take it. On arrival at her workplace, the complainant encountered a female colleague, Julie Martire. After a moment's pleasantries, the complainant broke down and told Ms Martire that she was: 

""in trouble, in big trouble."" (T 152) 

She fell to the floor, crying, and pointing to the bruises on her face. 

43Eventually, on the urging of Ms Martire, the complainant rang Rose Bay Police Station, and then Paddington Police Station, where she spoke to Constable Westfallen. The complainant was taken to the Police Station and then the hospital, where she was medically examined by Dr Patricia Brennan. 

Other evidence in the Crown case 

44I will in due course return to deal with the cross-examination of the complainant. Evidence was also given in the Crown case by Dr Patricia Brennan, Mr Vincent Lopez, Mr Michael Bailey, Ms Julie Martire, Mr Peter Smith, Ms Annamaria Galimi, Ms Louise Humphries, and police officers Mark Reynolds, Kylie Westfallen, Anthony Whyte and Kay Whitty. 

45Dr Brennan was the medical director of the Liverpool Sexual Assault Service and a staff specialist in forensic medicine at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. She examined the complainant, and took a history from her. The history includes the following: 

""On 3 January 2008 between the hours of 1440pm and 1630pm ... I attended an interview with [the complainant]. When asked what happened [the complainant] described how she had been in a violent threatening relationship with a male she has lived with for nine months. She stated she'd previously rung the police but signed a disclaimer as being 'too terrified to proceed with police'. When asked to describe the violence [the complainant] states that three weeks ago the male struck her on the forehead, a large egg shaped bruise came up on the right side of the forehead and then yesterday after about 1pm when her parents left he shut the door, grabbed her by the clothes, punched her face and head back hard such that her glasses broke. He then proceeded to slap her hard across the head, over the ears and face, she was sitting on the bed crying and he then threatened her with scissors which he had on the bed. He pulled her shoes off and then her underpants, she took her dress off and he proceeded to have forced penile-vaginal intercourse without a condom. At some stage he punched her in the abdomen ..."" (T 219-20) 

46On physical examination Dr Brennan observed ""abrasioned bruises"" above and below the left eye, pin point bruising near the ear, a bruise over the right eye, an abrasion on the neck, abrasions to the right hand and bruising to the lips. Dr Brennan formed the opinion that the injuries she observed were consistent with the history given by the complainant of having been slapped heavily over the ears and the face. 

47Dr Brennan took a number of specimens from the complainant's body, including low and high vaginal swabs and smears, and vulval swabs and smears. (These were later analysed and DNA tested by the Division of Analytical Laboratories.) 

48Mr Lopez was the driver of the bus taken by the appellant and the complainant on the morning of 3 January. He recalled picking up a male and a female (accepted as having been the appellant and the complainant). The complainant was ""acting a bit distressed"". He said that she entered the bus, and then alighted to get something from the appellant. She was screaming at him on the bus. She took a bag from him and re-entered the bus, followed by the male. They argued, the appellant speaking loudly to the complainant, and asking if she wished to make a scene. Mr Lopez pulled into a bus stop and told them to separate or leave the bus. The complainant thanked him and walked to the back of the bus. The appellant started speaking loudly to her again, ""cursing"" and swearing. They left the bus at Bondi Junction, the complainant holding the bag. 

49Mr Bailey was a passer-by in Bondi Junction on the morning of 3 January. He observed a female (accepted as having been the complainant) walking towards him in an upset and distressed state, and looking over her shoulder. She was carrying a black bag in her right hand and attempting to use a mobile telephone with her left. A male (accepted as having been the appellant) ran past Mr Bailey, and in front of the complainant, and grabbed her with both hands around the arms. She told him to let her go; he demanded to know what was the matter with her. 

50Ms Martire worked with the complainant in Bondi Junction. She was the first person to whom the complainant spoke when she arrived in the office on the morning of 3 January. She said to Ms Martire: 

""Julie, I'm in so much trouble"" 

and began to cry (T 374). 

51Ms Martire asked what had happened, the complainant replied: 

""Simon raped me."" 

The complainant then told Ms Martire that, the previous day, her parents had dropped her off at her apartment, but that as soon as they left: 

""... she got dragged into the unit by her hair ... Then he [the appellant] just started hitting her around the ears"", 

held scissors at her throat and held her down on the bed. The complainant told Ms Martire that she tried to push the appellant away and had her hands on her face in attempting to do so. 

52Ms Martire observed some bruises to both sides of the complainant's head, especially around the tops of the ears, and a little mark under her left eye. She told Ms Martire she had tried to conceal the injuries with make up. 

53The complainant then telephoned police. 

54Mr Smith was the caretaker of the boarding house in which the appellant and the complainant had inspected a room in the afternoon of 2 January. He recalled the appellant and the complainant arriving at the premises but noticed that they were not talking to each other. He was able to give a description of the complainant as having a small frame and blonde hair, and wearing a dress. He noted that she was attractive. 

55After they inspected the room the appellant and the complainant left. The next Mr Smith saw of the appellant was on the following Sunday, 6 January. The appellant returned to Mr Smith's premises, and wanted to talk to him. He asked Mr Smith if he remembered him. The appellant said: 

""I was here, came around looking at a room for my girlfriend. She's accused me of assault. It's a frame up. Could you say that nothing happened between us while we were here?"" (T 379) 

Mr Smith replied: 

""Nothing happened between you while you were here."" 

The appellant then pulled out a document, which he asked Mr Smith to sign, as he said: 

""... to verify that nothing happened while we were here."" 

Mr Smith declined to do so, saying that the appellant was a complete stranger to him and that, as he had not made the statement himself, he would not sign it. 

56Ms Galimi was a hairdresser working in the salon at which the complainant had an appointment on 2 January. She recalled an occasion towards the end of 2007 when she was attending to the complainant's hair, when she noticed a bald patch at the back of her head. She described it as: 

""It was just, it was just a missing patch of her hair, very, very short, it was very, very obvious."" (T 385) 

57Ms Humphries was a neighbour of the complainant. She rented an apartment immediately above that of the complainant. She recognised but did not know the complainant. She was aware that the appellant moved into the apartment in about April 2007. She recalled a conversation with the appellant on 22 December 2007, during which the appellant said: 

""... yes, I know, it's over, we're not together anymore. She's told me I have to be out by 1 January."" (T 389) 

58Ms Humphries also recalled 2 January 2008. She could hear an argument from the complainant's apartment between a male and a female that involved: 

""... just a whole heap of yelling and crying."" 

The female was crying, and the male was yelling. She said that this took place between 4.00 and 5.30pm. 

59She had heard arguments from that apartment previously, perhaps in October. 

60Constable Reynolds gave evidence of having attended at the complainant's apartment on 4 January. He saw a pair of broken sunglasses in a cupboard in the bedroom, and a pair of scissors on the floor in the bedroom, to the left of the bed. 

61Constable Westfallen was the police officer with whom the complainant had a conversation on 15 October 2007, and another the following day, 16 October. On that date the complainant signed a statement in Constable Westfallen's official notebook. That statement is: 

""On Monday 15 October 2007 I had a conversation with Constable Westfallen over the telephone. I held this conversation in confidence and wanted police to be aware I was separating with my partner Simon. I do not have any immediate fears for my safety in the future. I and Simon have discussed separation and Simon is moving out by Friday 19 October 2007 and Simon has agreed to this. At this stage I do not want any police action."" (T 398) 

62Constable Westfallen spoke to the complainant again at about 8.30am on 3 January, and later in the morning she met the complainant at the Paddington Police Station. She observed bruising and swelling around the complainant's left eye and abrasions to her face. She accompanied the complainant to the hospital where she was examined by Dr Brennan. 

63Constable Westfallen also gave evidence that on the same day, 3 January, she received a telephone call from the appellant, and that he walked into the police station at 9.20am that day. She observed a superficial scratch across his left cheek, and a faded bruise on his left leg. 

64On 3 January Constable Whyte was rostered for duty at Paddington Police Station. At 9.20am on that day, the appellant entered the police station, saying that he wished to report an assault. He said: 

""My girlfriend has assaulted me and she's making claims that she's going to tell police that I've raped her."" (T 416) 

The appellant named the complainant, and said: 

""It's an ongoing thing, have a look at this, she's had a real good go at me"", 

indicating scratch marks on his face, 

""[name of complainant] is trying to make it look like I've been raping her. She's threatening to tell the police that I bashed her and raped her. She reckons I've drugged her with medication."" 

65The appellant then raised his shorts and indicated five to eight pale yellow bruises, of golf ball size, between his thighs. He said: 

""See, she's hit me with a baseball bat, she's mad ... I've been teaching her to box, you know I'm a fighter, I like to keep fit. She asked me to teach her to fight. I tried to teach her but the marks on her face are because she wouldn't listen to me and she gets hit in the head all the time."" (T 416) 

Exhibit J is a series of photographs of various parts of the appellant's body taken at the Waverley Police Station on 8 January. 

66The appellant told Constable Whyte that he did not wish to pursue assault charges, but preferred to make a report. He said that he had spoken to Constable Westfallen, and another police officer, and ""they know what she's like"". 

67The following day Constable Whyte attended the complainant's premises and took part in a search of the apartment. On the floor under the bed he found a pair of scissors. The bed was ""dishevelled"", the mattress off the base, draping down to the floor. 

68In cross-examination, Constable Whyte said that when he came to the police station on 3 January, the appellant was in possession of a pillowcase, containing clothing, which he showed to the constable. Constable Whyte did not see any blood on the pillowcase. The appellant told him that the sheets (which he did not produce) had his blood on them. 

69Detective Whitty was the officer in charge of the investigation of the complainant's allegations. She was contacted by Constable Westfallen during the afternoon of 3 January, and at 4.30pm on that day, she spoke to the complainant. She observed some bruising behind the complainant's right ear. On that day, and the following day, Detective Whitty took a statement from the complainant. With other police she attended at the complainant's apartment. 

70In that statement the complainant told Detective Whitty that she had seen the scissors on the bed (the implication being that she had not seen them previously). Thereafter, from time to time, Detective Whitty received emails from the complainant. In one email, dated 4 February, the complainant told Detective Whitty that she had been giving some thought to where she had first seen the scissors. Her clear recollection at that date was (in accordance with her evidence) that she had heard the appellant rummaging in the drawers in the kitchen, and that she was ""certain"" that that was when and where the appellant had obtained the scissors, and that they were not already on the bed (at the time the two entered the bedroom). 

71On 8 January Detective Whitty went to the Waverley Police Station where she saw the appellant. He was cautioned and declined to answer any questions. A buccal swab, for the purpose of DNA testing, was taken from him; since, in the trial, the appellant accepted that there had been sexual intercourse on the day, the result of that testing did not assume great prominence in the trial, although, as will appear below, it had indirect relevance. 

72In cross-examination, Detective Whitty said that a canvass had been made of the residents in the apartment block; only one witness (Louise Humphries) emerged as having any relevant information. 

73In cross-examination, Detective Whitty was able to give evidence of two telephone calls made by the appellant to the emergency number, 000. These were made at 10.23pm on 14 October and 3.18pm on 31 December 2007 respectively. Transcripts of the telephone calls were in evidence as Exs H1 and H2. 

74In the first call the appellant asked the operator if there was ""a reference number"" for the call. He confirmed that calls to that number were tape-recorded. He then gave his first name and his date of birth and said: 

""I've a girlfriend that is threatening me. She threatened me with an iron bar. She's threatened me that she's going to set me up with the police because she knows if she makes a complaint to the police, the police will come and arrest me. So I just want to put this on record that that's what ..."" 

The transcript then shows that something untranscribable was said in an unidentified female voice, followed by the appellant saying: 

""No she doesn't want to talk to you. I just want to put ..."" 

The operator then asked for his address but the appellant declined to give one. The operator said that the only way he could put it on record was for the police to come to see him. There was then some further speaking from an unidentified voice in the background, followed by the appellant saying: 

""Excuse me, excuse me. I'm just telling the lady. Excuse me, madam. So that's all I'm doing, I'm putting it on record, thank you. Bye."" 

75In the second call the appellant again confirmed that what he said was being recorded and said: 

""Oh good, okay, so there'll be a record of it."" 

The operator confirmed that. The appellant said: 

""Okay, goody. Now, I'm very sorry to occupy your emergency line ... I've made a complaint of a domestic violence matter, and also threats from my girlfriend to say that she was going to say that I raped her and all of this ..."" 

He gave his full name and date of birth and was asked by the operator to identify his complaint. He said: 

""My complaint is now that, that I'm obviously, um, thinking that this person is trying to set me up with the police to get me, um, ah, charged with something I didn't do. So I'm calling the police ..."" 

The operator asked if he would like police to attend, to which he replied: 

""No, well, I want to be able ... I'm just putting on record, because I know this is recorded, and I'm sorry to call 000 ..."" 

76There was then an exchange between him and the operator about the call being recorded, and the appellant said that he did not mean ""to take up your time ..."". He then said: 

""I'm in fear, I'm in fear of being set up by this ... with this woman for something I didn't do and I want it on record that I've spoken to you about it, that she's threatened me to say that she's going to make up a story to say that I raped her and all this type of thing, and I want it on record because, I've got ... don't worry I've got letters and everything, there's no way she's going to get around this."" 

The operator confirmed that the appellant did not wish police to attend and the call ended. I note without comment that this second call was made on 31 December, at a time when the complainant was still in Goulburn with her family. 

77Detective Whitty also gave evidence (somewhat imprecise) that in early December the appellant had spoken by telephone to a Detective Sergeant Krisafuli, who recorded in the duty book that the appellant was concerned that the complainant was threatening ""that she would set him up for rape"" or words to that effect. 

78Exhibits G1 and G2 were Certificates of Analysis from the Division of Analytical Laboratories. The first certificate established an overwhelming probability that the appellant's DNA was present in the high vaginal swab taken from the complainant. 

79The second certificate provided an answer to a question posed by Detective Whitty. The question was: 

""What is the estimated time frame for the persistence of spermatozoa in the vagina?"" 

After explaining the progressive process of dilution and degradation of seminal fluids, the analyst indirectly answered the question as follows: 

""I would estimate the time since intercourse in this case as most likely to be less than 24 hours and possibly less than 12 hours."" 

(The sample had, on the evidence of Dr Brennan, been taken between 2.40pm and 4.30pm on 3 January.) 

Cross-examination of the complainant 

80The complainant was extensively cross-examined. In the first questions asked of her, it was established clearly that the appellant's response to the allegation was that the sexual intercourse that had (apparently admittedly) taken place on the afternoon of 2 January was consensual, and that the complainant's assertion to the contrary was a lie. 

81It was then put to the complainant that after consensual sexual intercourse she and the appellant went to Double Bay, then returned to the apartment, and that, while the appellant was in the bedroom, the complainant rushed at him in a ""very, very angry"" state, brandishing scissors with which she attacked the appellant, accusing him of having had a female in the apartment, and that, in order to protect himself, and stop the attack, the appellant slapped the complainant. 

82This, no doubt, was an attempt to explain a number of circumstances in the Crown case - the injuries to the complainant's face (observed by Dr Brennan and Constable Westfallen), the presence of scissors in the bedroom (seen by Constable Reynolds and Constable Whyte), the excursion to Double Bay (confirmed by Mr Smith), and the presence of the appellant's DNA in the complainant's body. The complainant emphatically denied the proposition put, labelling the scenario ""a lie"". 

83At one point in the cross-examination counsel asked the complainant about her psychiatric condition. She said that she had consulted a psychiatrist ""maybe six or seven years ago"" (T 202) (from the date of her giving evidence, December 2008). She denied having been referred because of ""massive mood swings"", but was not expressly asked what she understood was the basis for the referral. She agreed that she was prescribed medication to control mood swings. She said, in response to a series of questions: 

""I was under the impression that it was because I'd had a really crappy year and I was feeling a bit down, that was it as far as I understood it ... 

... as I understood it, it was because I was having a really crappy year. I didn't ever hear the term mood swings, sorry. 

... 

I went there [to the psychiatrist] because I was having a crappy year and I wanted to talk about it."" (T 203) 

She said that she was prescribed an anti-depressant. 

84Counsel also cross-examined at considerable length about the relationship between the appellant and the complainant. The complainant agreed that the appellant had been working on a film project, called ""Plastic Fantastic"", for which he was seeking sponsorship, and with which she was assisting by typing documents. 

85One subject of cross-examination concerned the complainant's second pregnancy, which she acknowledged was not accidental. It was put to her that, as at September 2007, the relationship was sufficiently close for her to become pregnant. She said that the appellant wanted to have a baby; she did not want to make him angry, and that she did not wish to have a baby with him. She said: 

""... I did what I needed to survive ..."" (T 238) 

86Another subject of cross-examination concerned inconsistencies or discrepancies in the various accounts given by the complainant to Dr Brennan, Detective Whitty and Ms Martire, and the evidence she gave in the trial. Dr Brennan recorded that the complainant said that the appellant ""grabbed her by the clothes""; the complainant did not give evidence to that effect. Nor did she say that to Detective Whitty when interviewed. Ms Martire said that the complainant told her that the appellant dragged her into the unit by the hair. The complainant did not give evidence to that effect, and denied having said so to Ms Martire. 

87As to the events of 2 January, the complainant was expressly asked whether any incident in which she was crying or screaming had occurred at a time after the 2.56pm telephone call to the hairdresser. Her answer was definite, that no such incident had occurred after that time. 

88The complainant agreed that in email communications with Detective Whitty at some (unspecified) time after 3 January, she had said that the first time she saw the scissors they were on the bed, and that it had occurred to her that the whole scenario had been planned by the appellant. In her evidence she said that she first saw the scissors in the appellant's hand in the bedroom. 

89The complainant was also cross-examined about telephone records that showed that a call had been made from the appellant's mobile telephone to her own at 4.22pm on 2 January. The call lasted 12 seconds. This was intended to contradict her assertion that, from the time she returned from Goulburn on that day, she and the appellant were constantly and continuously in one another's company. After some thought (overnight) the complainant explained this by saying that the appellant was in the habit of taking her mobile telephone from her. If he were unable to find it, he called it so that it could be located from its ring tone. 

90A good deal of the material that provided the basis for the cross-examination consisted of electronic communications between the complainant and the appellant, either email or SMS messages. In considering this cross-examination it is important to bear in mind that the complainant fixed the date of the termination of the relationship as 16 October 2007. She was adamant that, from that date, she and the appellant had no romantic relationship. It is, however, also relevant that her evidence had been of an abusive and violent relationship for some time before that date. It is also relevant that, in her evidence in chief, the complainant said that she and the appellant had reconciled, after the day that she signed Constable Westfallen's notebook (T 78). (That was 16 October.) 

91Exhibit 5 was a folder of emails that passed between the complainant and the appellant. To the casual observer, these appear to be the communications of a loving, untroubled, couple. It is worth taking a little time on their contents. On 24 September 2007 (when she was pregnant) the complainant sent an email to the appellant. She gave as the subject line ""Cub Cub"". The message was: 

""This is what we have made so far ..."" 

and was accompanied by a photograph of a foetus. 

92On 2 October the complainant sent another email, headed ""Daddy Update"". The message read: 

""Good morning baby, here is some information for you. The photos are spread over two pages, in case you miss some. 

Love you Mr Monteiro x 

..."" 

The balance of the email gave information about her pregnancy. 

93Both of these emails pre-date 16 October, the date the complainant claimed the relationship ended, and are, therefore, perhaps, unsurprising. However, the tone appears to have remained unchanged after that date. On 25 October the complainant forwarded to the appellant an email headed ""Mental Feng Shui"" that she said contained ""words of wisdom that make a good deal of sense"" and that she thought was worth sending on. The tone is friendly and affectionate. 

94On 29 October the appellant emailed the complainant, commencing ""Hi baby"", and concluding: 

""I love you, thank you for this."" 

95On 30 October the appellant emailed the complainant, telling her she was getting ""a little testy"", and concluding ""Love you always"", followed by a line and a half of x's and ""And 1 million more"". The complainant replied, commencing ""Sime darling"", saying that she was not ""testy"", just ""frikking busy"", and signing ""Your [complainant's abbreviated first name] xox"". (The x's and o's that permeated the emails represented kisses and hugs.) 

96On 28 November the complainant emailed the appellant, saying ""check out how clever your girl is"", and saying ""Love you ... xo"". 

97Later the same day she again emailed the appellant, beginning ""HONEY"", and saying: 

""This is EXCELLENT!! This will all come together. Your efforts will pay off. I am SOOOOOOOOOO PROUD of you. Good Job ..."" (bold and upper case in original) 

She signed: 

""Love you ... xoxo"" 

98On 3 December the complainant emailed the appellant, commencing ""Baby"", and saying (after the main message): 

""I hope you are having a wonderful and positive day ... Love you, 

[abbreviated name of complainant] xox"" 

99Another email on 11 December she commenced ""Babe"". 

100On 13 December a number of emails passed between the two. In one, the complainant sent the appellant: 

""... an idea for a double sided business card for you"", 

and finished with: 

""Love you xoxo."" 

101On 14 December the appellant emailed the complainant, calling her ""Honey"", and asking her to do some artwork for him for Plastic Fantastic. The last line was a long row of x's and o's. 

102There were indications of a different tone on some occasions. On 12 December the complainant emailed the appellant about the Plastic Fantastic project. After a personal message, she wrote: 

""By the way Simon, contrary to your preferred opinion , I am not a fool. I am well aware that it has been your modus operandi over the past period to secure a means or reason to gain access to telephone records to try and find a reason not to trust me. Sorry to disappoint you and your ever fervent efforts, but there is nothing to hide here. I do not believe that having the aforementioned documentation will gain any weight to your defense, but then again, I am not a lawyer - but I am not a dummy either! 

Do you have any idea what it is like to be CONSTANTLY doubted by you. If I say I am not on the phone Simon, I am NOT on the phone. Simple. I have no reason to lie to you Simon. Maybe you are so paranoid because you have been lied to in the past, or perhaps, because you lie, you presume it is my mode of operation too. If you are trying to catch me out or set me up Simon, I am afraid you are not only wasting your time, but pushing me away. At a rate of knots. STOP tarring me with a brush that carries a paint different to my own. 

..."" (bold and upper case in original) 

103When asked about why, if she was, as she claimed, attempting to finish the relationship and get away from the appellant, she complained that he was pushing her away, she said: 

""... all of this was part of my survival manual, I didn't know how to manage the abusive situation that I was in and so I was trying to keep things peaceful, I wanted him to be successful so he'd just leave."" (T 333) 

104In the morning of 17 December she emailed the appellant. The purpose was to make arrangements for the payment of a telephone bill. But the complainant added: 

""One last thing - 

All I ever really wanted Simon was to be respected by you. That's all. You cannot love somebody if you don't respect them. If I asked you not to do something to something that was not yours, I wanted you to honour that. That's' all. As I said to you Simon, it was never about the juice, or the diet coke, or WHATEVER. Just about the fact that you always did what you wanted, with whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted. You constantly second guessed me and went through my belongings. Don't get me wrong, Simon, I have nothing to hide, it is just horrible, to have somebody going through your stuff, taking it, hiding it, doing whatever with it. That is why I react Simon. I don't think that is a very nice way to treat anybody. Let alone, a person you profess to love. It just does not stack up. 

You are right about most things Simon. I am fat. I am ugly. My use by date has been and gone. I am an 'egg'. You are right about most things. One thing you are wrong about is the lump in my breast. Perhaps the wish you made aloud to your mum about me getting cancer of the 'twat' or whatever rude word you called it, has just misplaced itself. We will just have to wait and see. Perhaps you are far more powerful than I gave you credit for. I stand corrected."" (bold and upper case in original) 

105On 18 December the complainant emailed the appellant, attaching some documents that she said she had found on her computer. She gave some advice about available food in the apartment, reminded the appellant about arranging payment of the telephone bill, and added: 

""I am so sad that we were such a disaster Simon. In answer to your question this morning, yes, I do love you Simon. My love for you has never been in question. Print it, shout it to the world, subpoena it, if you must, but, sometimes, love just aint enough. I need so much more than I have received from you - and no, I am not talking materially, although, it is relevant ..."" 

106The final email in the series was a short one from the appellant to the complainant dated 22 December enclosing, for her to show to her family, a synopsis of the Plastic Fantastic project. 

107On the evening of 17 December the complainant sent to the appellant a series of text messages. Although the evidence is not easy to follow, it seems that the appellant had gone out without the complainant and she was unable to contact him on his telephone. At 9.03pm she sent a text message saying that she would leave the keys in the usual spot, and repeated this just two minutes later. At 9.23pm she sent the following message: 

""I know it's none of my business but a part of me is sad that you have moved on so quickly as you said you were leaving an hour ago. I hope she is nice."" 

When asked about this message, the complainant said, repeatedly, that she sent it because she wanted the appellant to think that she was disturbed, so that this would make him ""move on"" and that she wanted him to think that she was sad that she did not want them to be together any more. 

108At 9.53pm she sent a further message about the keys; at 10.23pm she sent the following message: 

""Simon, I'm sick of your selfishness and lack of respect for anybody but yourself. Borrow some money from your uncle and get the hell out of my life. You've well and truly outstayed your welcome. This charity has closed its doors. Go and find somebody else to sponge off. You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a huge bruise on my forehead from you and you can't even bother to call. You are a loser."" 

At 10.48pm she sent the last of the messages for that evening. It read: 

""Don't bother coming back here. You are horrible. I was even arranging a Christmas present for you as you will be on your own. What was I thinking? As you've turned your phone off you dirty alcoholic I can't tell you where I've put the keys. I was explaining the whole respect thing to you and you can't even hold the ball for one day. Very sad. Not angry Simon, just supremely disappointed. Please don't come back here tonight as I need to sleep. x"" 

109She said that she sent this message out of exasperation because there was only one set of keys to the apartment, and she could not go to bed until the appellant knew whether she was going to leave the keys, and she could then lock the door. When asked about contemplating buying a Christmas present for the appellant in the circumstances she claimed to exist, the complainant reasserted that she was terrified of him and said that she would have done anything to keep him ""peaceful"" (T 210). 

110She said that when the appellant finally arrived at home late that night, she opened the door for him, and, out of frustration, slapped his face. 

111Also in evidence as Ex 2 was a rather lengthy handwritten note from the complainant to the appellant, the provenance of which is not clear, but which needs to be re-produced in full. The note reads: 

""beautiful boy, a beautiful Soul who deserves to and will shine. I am really sad and heartbroken at the moment but ultimately am blessed to have shared this small part of my journey. I have learned much of love and life at your hand and hopefully, when my wounds have healed, I will look back and smile and understand why things turned out like this. I am not quite sure what lesson the Universe is trying teach me through this experience but hopefully, one day I'll get it. I meant what I said in my sms. My love for you is boundless and not in any diminished by our human experience. If at any time, for whatever reason, you feel sad or alone, or if the demons that haunt us all from time to time come, just close your eyes and you will feel my love - wherever you are and whatever your circumstance or situation may be you just called and said you want to talk to me this afternoon but I don't know what else there is to talk about. If you are worried that I would ever be vindictive or nasty - please get those thoughts out of your head. You can keep them there if you want but they are unnecessary and unfounded as I will hold no malice. Perhaps that is why I am alone and perhaps will always be alone as my very nature enables people to take advantage of me - whether that be emotionally or financially. Maybe I am just too messed up and insecure that I keep on giving because I am scared to be alone or rejected. I don't know the answer(s) but from now, at least in solitude, I will always know who I can count on, where my support will come from and learn that neither acceptance or love come from another person or life experience. I am tired - exhausted in fact - of being let down. Of indulging momentarily and believing in happiness and excitement - only to find once more - that it is a journey that nobody wants to share with me - other than Bosley. I just realised this is turning all soppy and it is not serving any due purpose - self-indulgent twaddle - as you would say. I know that anything we have shared - and any secrets we have told - are safe with me. I am not a nasty person and genuinely wish you all the best. 

I meant what I said about you leaving and not having to pay back the money you theoretically 'owe' me. I did not support us with a tit for tat mentality. There are lessons in every situation and I have to teach myself the hard way. Besides - I am not a victim and always have and always will land on my feet. 

With regard to our c.c. I don't expect you to give me money. I will work things out. There are government pension things that can help and I have paid my taxes for 20 years so it is time for the system to work for me. 

I don't understand how legal things work in situations like this but I think if I initial and date each page it should be enough so you don't have to ever worry but when you make it big time that I will change my mind. 

I checked the flights because you didn't tell me which one you have changed to but I will go out (the last one lands at 11.10pm) as I don't want to make things worse for either of us. Please let me know when you have sorted out your things. I know it will take some time (but I understand why you want to move to QLD - you need a new start like you said and you will like it there). I will just pop in and out to get some clothes etc and leave you your space to do your things. I know you have a big meeting on Monday - so I imagine you won't put anything in place until after that time. Let us do this peacefully and quietly as we both did our best and for whatever reason it didn't work out and is obviously not meant to be. Sometimes it is hard but you just have to let things go as hanging on just hurts your fingers."" 

112The note bears on the bottom of each page the date ""22/10/07"". The complainant acknowledged that she had written the letter, and thought that she had left it in the apartment for the appellant but queried the date. She said that she did write a date but it probably would have been ""more like the second"" (ie 2 October). She also said that it was written at a time when she and the appellant were going to separate, and that he was supposed to vacate the apartment on 19 October. She said she took this view about the date of the letter because there were references in the note to her being pregnant and that she had had the pregnancy terminated on 16 October. (I assume that what she said were references to the pregnancy are those to ""our c.c."" and government pensions.) 

113The complainant agreed that, in August 2007, she had, at the request of the appellant, purchased a baseball bat for the appellant. It was put to her, in effect, that it was unlikely that she would do this if she had been, as she asserted, ""terrified"" of the appellant. She replied: 

""I lived on egg shells the whole time ..."" (T 273) 

and said: 

""I was surrounded by iron bars anyway, so what's a baseball bat?"" (T 274) 

114Also in evidence were two bundles of photographs. The first, Ex 4, were said to have been taken on 27 October 2007 by the appellant and the complainant. They are portrait shots of one another, and do not suggest any animosity; indeed, each appears to be very happy. The second set of photographs, Ex 3, was said to have been taken on 3 November, by a friend of the appellant's. They depict the appellant and the complainant in apparently loving embrace. (The dates on which the photographs were taken were never established; the dates mentioned above are drawn from counsel's questions. The nearest the complainant came to giving a date was: 

""it would've been towards the end of last year"" 

ie the end of 2007.) 

115The complainant was also cross-examined about her contact with the appellant during the time she was in Goulburn over Christmas. Mobile telephone records revealed extensive telephone calls between the two of them, on one occasion continuing over more than an hour and a half. It seems, from the evidence, that most of the calls emanated from the appellant's telephone, although there were some, much shorter, calls from the complainant to the appellant. It was suggested that this was because the complainant had limited credit on her telephone, and may have called the appellant only in order to have him call her back. The complainant said that she participated in these conversations because she was frightened of what the appellant would do. She denied a proposition put to her that she and the appellant were attempting a reconciliation. 

116Although the complainant agreed that the emails extracted above had been exchanged between herself and the appellant, she was not asked to explain the apparent contradiction between their consistently (until 12 December) loving tone, and her assertion that the relationship had ceased by 16 October. And although, at the end of cross-examination, the Crown Prosecutor sought and was granted an opportunity to confer with her, specifically for the purpose of preparing for re-examination, no question was asked to elicit such an explanation. I do observe, however, that, although the complainant pinpointed the date of cessation of the relationship as 16 October (by reference to the date of the second termination) she also said, in her evidence in chief, that the couple reconciled after the day on which she signed Constable Westfallen's notebook (which was also 16 October). 

The defence case 

117The appellant did not give evidence. No evidence was called on his behalf. Since, when arrested on 8 January and given the opportunity to participate in an interview, he had declined that opportunity and exercised his right to silence, there was no indication, other than what was put to the complainant in cross-examination, of his response to the complainant's allegations. There was no version of events given in his own words. Those propositions, where rejected by the complainant, were therefore entirely without evidentiary foundation. Counsel said, in the presence of the jury, that he was ""content to rely on the matters elicited in cross-examination"" (T 455). (That was supplemented by the documentary material admitted into evidence during the course of cross-examination.) 

118The appellant's case was encapsulated in a series of questions put to the complainant at the end of her cross-examination. It is convenient to re-produce the questions, together with her answers: 

""Q When you came back to the apartment, the true position is this. That there was no sexual assault, it was consensual sex that started off with you giving him a massage. That's the fact isn't? 
A Absolutely not. 

Q After the sex, which took some little time, when you were talking about various things there was then discussion of separating and you wanted some money didn't you? 
A Absolutely not. 

Q You told him that you had been speaking with your friend Tanya about being able to claim as a de facto -- 
A Absolutely not. Sorry, absolutely not Mr Jeffreys. 

Q After the sexual intercourse had taken place we've established have we not that the sexual assault that you claim took place you say that you rang the hairdresser? 
A At 3.00pm in the afternoonish. 

Q At 3.00pm alright and then after 3.00pm you say you were trying to calm the accused - you weren't calming the accused down, you were going through Domain with him to see if you could find accommodation and talking to him about accommodation and things of that nature, correct? 
A Yeah. 

Q Between the time of the phone call and when you left to go to Double Bay was there any incident where you were crying or screaming or making a noise about anything? After the phone call. 
A After I'd called the hairdresser? 

Q Yes. 
A No. 

Q So after the phone call we've established that as 2.46 [sic - this may be a transcription error; earlier evidence established the phone call as having taken place at 2.46pm] 

... 

Q I suggest to you that after the phone call some couple of hours, maybe an hour after the phone call you had this discussion with the accused which I've put to you about getting some money? 
A No Mr Jeffreys. 

Q You told the accused that he was leaving you and you were broke and he was going to get money from Plastic Fantastic, he was going to get money from the property deal and you wanted a share. That's the fact isn't it? 
A There was no such conversation Mr Jeffreys. 

Q You'd certainly thought about it earlier because you wrote about it in your letter or note of 22 October hadn't you? 
A I'm sorry I don't follow. 

... 

Q You said that the legal things that that was referring to was any suggestion that you might make a de facto claim, remember that? 
A That is correct. 

Q This was something I suggest to you that you raised on 2 January after you'd had the phone call to the hairdresser? 
A That's not true Mr Jeffreys there was no such conversation. 

Q He told you that you weren't entitled to anything because you'd only been together for a short of period of time and then you started bursting out crying, what do you say to that? 
A No Mr Jeffreys. 

Q The accused was saying to you 'Look you're not entitled to that, you're not getting it' and he was talking down to you in that fashion, now what do you say to that? 
A No Mr Jeffreys. 

Q That was some time between 4.00pm and 6.00pm, probably closer to 6.00pm, 5.30, 6.00 o'clock what do you say to that? 
A Nothing like that happened Mr Jeffreys."" (T 340-342) 

and: 

""Q Now once you got back to the unit in Birriga Road [from Double Bay] I suggest to you that you then started doing some of your art work and Mr Monteiro went into the bedroom. What do you say to that? 
A Absolutely not. 

Q I suggest to you that at some stage you came into the bedroom and confronted him with a hair clip, that's a female hair clip. What do you say to that? 
A Absolutely not. 

Q I suggest to you that you said words to the effect of, 'Whose is this? You've had a female or a woman in the flat.' What do you say to that? 
A Absolutely not. 

Q ... 
And you asked him if he had any females in the flat, what do you say to that? 
A Absolutely not. 

Q He told you that he had a person from the Marrickville Council in relation to the Plastic Fantastic project? 
A There was no such conversation. 

... 

Q You also asked him if he'd been seeing any other women? 
A No I didn't. 

Q He told you that he'd seen a friend Vanessa and he'd had a coffee with her, and you said, 'You've been fucking her.'? 
A No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q You just got yourself worked up and angry and then you had your scissors in your hand and you attacked him whilst he was on the bed? 
A No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q You told him that you were going to gouge his eyes out with scissors? 
A. No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q That's when he slapped you? 
A No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q He slapped you a number of times and tried to push you away as you were attacking him with the scissors and you were biting him at the same time, what do you say to that? 
A No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q Now the next day you say don't you that when you got on the bus, or before you got on the bus, Mr Monteiro was claiming that you'd stolen some money? 
A That is correct. 

Q You had in fact taken his money hadn't you? 
A No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q You told him that you were leaving the flat? 
A I told him I was leaving the flat, yes. 

Q That you were going to stay out until you found somewhere else? 
A That I would not be returning, correct ... Sorry, to be precise, I wouldn't be returning and I was arranging for a removalist to come on the Saturday to collect my belongings, and I did not return other than to get my stuff. 

... 

Q I suggest to you that after you'd attacked him with the scissors and he'd slapped you, you calmed down and he told you that he hadn't had sex with anybody through his entire relationship other than you, what do you say to that? 
A There was no such conversation, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q He told you that what you'd done to him, 'This is assault, I'm sick of this shit' what do you say to that? 
A Absolutely not. 

Q And a number of times whilst you were attacking him and also afterwards you said to him 'I hate you, I hate you' what do you say to that? 
A No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q You said to him 'I'll say you raped me, you're sperm or cum is inside me' what do you say to that? 
A No, Mr Jeffreys. 

Q And he said to you 'You're insane'? 
A There's no such conversation Mr Jeffreys. 

Q A discussion continued in you said 'After tonight I'll stay somewhere else until you move out' and the accused said 'Whatever' what do you say to that? 
A I said that I was not returning and that removalists would be getting my stuff on the day after, that was the only conversation that we had in anything to do with that."" (T 346-348) 

119There was other cross-examination about the events of 3 January but I do not propose to extract it. 

Ground 1 of the appeal: unreasonable verdict 

120Hesitant as I am to prolong this already lengthy judgment, it is necessary to state precisely the question to be posed when this ground of appeal is raised. That question was stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, in the following terms: 

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty ... But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations ... 

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence ..."" (pp 493-494, internal references omitted) 

That test was re-endorsed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. 

121The written submissions made by counsel on behalf of the appellant in support of this ground were concise and precisely structured. They hinged entirely upon an attack of the credibility of the complainant. 

122As is common in such cases, the only direct evidence of the events that gave rise to the charge was given by the complainant. The only challenge to that evidence is what emerged in her cross-examination. There is one qualification to the former proposition: the evidence of Ms Humphries was important evidence corroborative of the complainant's claim that an incident that was acrimonious and marked by violence, at least (on Ms Humphries' evidence) verbal violence, occurred on 2 January. Ms Humphries' evidence of her conversation with the appellant on 22 December is also important in countering the suggestion that the complainant was untruthful in her claim that, by that date at least, the relationship was over. 

123Counsel submitted that the evidence of the complainant was unreliable and ""unacceptable"". As I read their submissions, they made a number of specific points, which they said pointed to the implausibility of the complainant's account of the events and her explanations for matters that had arisen in cross-examination. The points may be encapsulated as follows: 

(i)that, despite the complainant's claim of having been sexually assaulted by the appellant in June or July, and again in September, she continued to live in the apartment with him for many months thereafter. This, it was put, was highly implausible; 

(ii)equally implausible (if not more so) is the complainant's evidence that, notwithstanding her assertions as to the appellant's prior conduct, she deliberately became pregnant again in September, planning to have a baby with the appellant; and her explanation that she did so in order to keep the appellant ""peaceful"" could not be believed; 

(iii)the complainant insisted that the relationship had come to an end on or by 16 October; the loving emails and photographs (Exs 3, 4 and 5) well after that date are irreconcilable with that proposition, as is Ex 2, the complainant's handwritten note bearing the date 22 October; 

(iv)the complainant's evidence that she lived in fear and was terrified of the appellant is irreconcilable with her evidence that, on 17 December, on his late return to the apartment, she slapped his face; 

(v)the records of telephone calls between the appellant and the complainant during her sojourn at Goulburn over Christmas cast further doubt on her claim that the relationship had ended; 

(vi)the complainant's purchase in August of a baseball bat for the appellant is inconsistent with her stated fears of his violence; 

(vii)the complainant's account of the critical events of 2 January is ""unacceptable"": in particular - 


in her initial account to police the complainant said that when she first saw the scissors they were on the bed; in her evidence she said that the appellant went to the kitchen and came running at her with the scissors in his hand; 

had the complainant been assaulted to the face as she claimed, it is implausible that Mr Smith would not have observed the marks to her face when she and the appellant inspected the boarding house; 

the record of a call from the appellant's mobile telephone to the complainant at 4.22pm on 2 January contradicts her assertion that the two of them were together continuously throughout the day from the time she arrived at the apartment; 

the complainant's assertion that, after the events she described, she and the appellant slept in the same bed is implausible; 

(viii)the complaint made by the complainant to police is entirely consistent with concerns expressed by the appellant in his two telephone calls to 000. 

124Some of these points are well made. Some are not. I will begin by disposing of those that are not, using the numbering system above. 

(i) and (ii) 

125These propositions disregard what is well known to those who take an interest in issues concerning domestic violence. It is all too common to see victims, most commonly women, overlook and forgive abusive treatment, and accept apologies, protestations of regret, declarations of love and promises to reform. Here, there is no evidence that the appellant ever acknowledged having behaved as the complainant said he did; but I find no difficulty in accepting, however regrettable it may be, that the complainant was prepared to proceed with the relationship notwithstanding the conduct she described. 

(vii) 

126I do not find it implausible that Mr Smith failed to observe any marks to the complainant's face. She said that she applied make-up to conceal the marks; there is no reason to think that Mr Smith paid particular attention to her. It is notable that although Mr Smith was closely cross-examined about his opportunity to observe the complainant, and about his observation that she was attractive, counsel adroitly steered clear of asking about marks or signs of injury to her face. The complainant's explanation for the 4.22pm telephone call is acceptable, if not persuasive. That is supported by the fact that the call itself was 12 seconds only. The complainant's assertion that, despite her protests, the two slept in the same bed after that assault is also explained by her evidence. 

(vi) 

127The evidence of the purchase of the baseball bat by the complainant falls into the same general category as (i) and (ii) above although, perhaps, with less force. The complainant said that she purchased the bat, at the appellant's request, ""for another purpose"", but was not given the opportunity of identifying what that purpose was. There is also some force in her response to one question, that she was surrounded by iron bars, so that a baseball bat posed little additional threat. 

128I now turn to those matters that have significant weight. The most compelling of these are the post 16 October emails, the text messages of 17 December, and the photographs, Exs 3 and 4, none of which suggests a fractured relationship, at least prior to 17 December. Much the same can be said of the lengthy and frequent telephone calls to the complainant at Goulburn, although the content of these calls is not known. But the events of Christmas day, when the appellant travelled to Goulburn, but was banished by the complainant, run counter to the conclusion that the relationship was friendly and functioning. 

129To the contrary is Ex 2. As I have mentioned, it bears, on each of 18 small pages, the date ""22/10/07"". The complainant accepted that she had dated the note, but suggested that that date could not be correct, because the note referred to her pregnancy (in current terms) and that pregnancy had been terminated six days earlier. She postulated that she had written the date ""2/10/07""; unstated, but clearly suggested, was that an additional ""2"" had been inserted. In my opinion, that hypothesis must be rejected. In the first place, it is impossible to conceive of any reason why anybody would have taken that course. In the second place, I have carefully examined the original of the exhibit. Admittedly without the aid of expert evidence, it appears to me that the date - the whole of the date - is written with the same pen as the whole of the note. Moreover, the ""2's"" appear plainly to have been written by the same hand. On some pages they are, to my eye, identical. The note, in my opinion, must be accepted as having been written on the date that it bears. I note that the jury were given the original of the note to enable them to compare it with the copies they had been given (T 128). 

130What to make of the note is more problematic. It is clear that, as at that date, the complainant perceived that the relationship had terminated. The references to the (already terminated) pregnancy (if that is what they are) are a mystery. Also a mystery is the circumstances in which the relationship reached the stage indicated in that note. It is quite inconsistent with the subsequent emails of 29 October, 30 October, 28 November, 3 December, 11 December, 13 December and 14 December. 

131In my opinion very significant weight indeed must be given to the email correspondence, the photographs, and Ex 2. The question for determination is whether that weight (together with other matters) is such as to create a reasonable doubt about the complainant's account of the events of 2 January. 

132There is some force in the point made about the complainant's evidence about where the scissors were when she first saw them. On balance, however, I am not greatly troubled by this, having regard to the highly traumatic events the complainant described. It is, I accept, a matter to be given some weight in the overall assessment of the case made on behalf of the Crown. 

133One matter to which little attention was paid, but which to me appears important, is Constable Reynolds' evidence of finding the broken sunglasses in the bedroom. There is nothing in the appellant's hypothesis that accounts for them - his proposition (it has to be called that, because there was no evidence to support it) was that, after their return from Double Bay, the complainant did some artwork before becoming enraged and attacking the appellant in the bedroom. It is unlikely, in those circumstances, that she would have been wearing sunglasses. 

134What was put, in the appellant's alternative scenario, in cross-examination of the complainant, was this: 


consensual sexual intercourse took place during the afternoon of 2 January (the timing roughly consistent with when the complainant alleges that non-consensual intercourse took place); 

following that sexual intercourse a discussion took place about separation, and about money - the complainant claiming some entitlement under de facto relationships legislation; 

after the sexual intercourse (at about 3.00pm) the complainant rang the hairdresser; 

after that the complainant and the appellant searched the Internet for accommodation; 

an hour or a couple of hours after that, the complainant and the appellant argued about her entitlements to make a claim against him under de facto relationships property legislation; 

thereafter (at an unspecified time (but probably about 20 minutes before 6.00pm)) the complainant and the appellant walked to Double Bay; 

on their return to Birriga Road the complainant began doing some art work, involving the use of scissors, while the appellant was in the bedroom; 

the complainant suddenly accused the appellant of having had another female in the apartment; 

the complainant became enraged and attacked the appellant on the bed with the scissors; 

the appellant slapped the complainant and she bit him. 

135The scenario is out of alignment with the evidence given by Ms Humphries, that the screaming and arguing she heard from the apartment occurred between 4.00pm and 5.30pm. Ms Humphries' evidence also does not sit easily with the scenario advanced by the Crown through the complainant. In particular her answer to one question is critical. The question was: 

""Between the time of the phone call and when you left to go to Double Bay was there any incident where you were crying or screaming or making a noise about anything? After the phone call."" 

The telephone call to which reference was made was the 2.56pm call to the hairdresser. 

136The answer given by the complainant was: 

""After I'd called the hairdresser? [at 2.56pm] ... No."" (T 341) 

But nor does Ms Humphries' evidence sit comfortably in the scenario advanced on behalf of the appellant. It was not suggested that the argument about money - that may be thought to have taken place between 4.00pm and 5.30pm - involved any screaming or crying. The question postulating a violent event involving scissors, precipitated by the complainant, suggested that that event occurred after the return from Double Bay, well after the outside time fixed by Ms Humphries. 

137Together with the evidence of the emails, photographs and text messages, Ms Humphries' evidence casts some doubt upon the complainant's general credibility, at least in relation to her recollection of the events of the later part of the afternoon of 2 January. 

138Ms Humphries' evidence does not cast doubt on the complainant's evidence about a violent and loud event earlier in the day because she (Ms Humphries) was not in her apartment until 4.00pm. 

139As against that is the evidence of Constable Whyte concerning the appellant's attendance at the police station on 3 January. There, he told Constable Whyte that the complainant had accused him of drugging her with medication and of hitting her with a baseball bat. He told Constable Whyte that he had been teaching her to box or to fight, and that the complainant sustained marks to her face because she would not listen to him and got hit in the head all the time. 

140These propositions were never put to the complainant and, it seems, by the time of trial the appellant disowned them. The attack upon this aspect of Constable Whyte's evidence took the form of a challenge to the accuracy of his record of the conversation. I will make that a little clearer. From the cross-examination, it appears that the relevant sequence, on the appellant's version, was this: 


when the appellant entered the police station and spoke to Constable Whyte he said that he wished to report an assault. Constable Whyte made some notes in his notebook but, because the appellant had told him that he did not wish to proceed with action, his notebook entry was incomplete - it was, Constable Whyte said, for use as ""a prompt or bare bones indicator of our conversation"" (T 424). Constable Whyte did not enter in the notebook any reference to the appellant teaching the complainant to box; 

the following morning, 4 January, Constable Whyte made a computerised entry in the COPS system. Although this was not in evidence (neither was the notebook) I infer from the cross-examination that the statement attributed to the appellant about teaching the complainant to box was included in that entry; 

on 13 January Constable Whyte made a formal statement for the purpose of the appellant's prosecution. I again infer that this incorporated the reference to teaching the complainant to box. 

141The inference that was invited was that Constable Whyte's evidence about the boxing lessons was, at the best, unreliable. But it was never put directly to Constable Whyte that the appellant did not make that statement; it was put to him that the appellant had said, in a flippant fashion in response to a question about marks on the complainant's face: 

""Boxing training, mate. I already told you what happened."" (T 427) 

The suggestion being that Constable Whyte had misunderstood, or recalled inaccurately, what the appellant had said. 

142The simple fact is that there was no evidence to support the appellant's hypothesised account of events. The complainant emphatically rejected every proposition contained in the series of questions I have extracted above, put as encapsulating the appellant's case. 

143I also note that the questions put to the complainant at the end her cross-examination included the proposition that she had attacked the appellant with scissors, intending to ""gouge his eyes out"" and was biting him. Not only were these accusations apparently not put to Constable Whyte, there is no evidence that the appellant showed him any sign of biting. 

144True it is that there are some - and some significant - aspects of the complainant's evidence that are inconsistent with other, objective, evidence. The most notable of these are her assertions concerning the course of the relationship, and the emails. These impinge upon her credibility. But, when examination is made of her account of the events of 2 January, no real inroads were made in cross-examination. What may appear to be a small point - the broken sunglasses - is, in fact, compellingly corroborative of her account. To that may be added the abandoned explanation given by the appellant to Constable Whyte for the bruising and injury to the complainant's face. 

145There was also some support for the complainant's account of the violence of the relationship in the evidence of Ms Galimi, the hairdresser, that she had, in September, observed a ""bald patch"" on the complainant's head where hair was missing. This was consistent with the complainant's claim that the appellant had pulled a clump of hair from her head. 

146In my opinion, it was well open to the jury on the evidence before it to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt. For my part, having made my own independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, I am also satisfied, to the same standard, of his guilt. I would therefore reject ground 1 of the appeal. 

Fresh evidence 

147The appellant sought to adduce additional evidence which appears to be relevant to this ground. The Court determined that the evidence should be admitted provisionally, and later determination made as to any use that could be made of it. The evidence upon which he sought to rely was contained in two statutory declarations made by Mr Peter Blyton, on 26 July 2010 and 16 August 2010. Mr Blyton also gave oral evidence. His proposed evidence was primarily directed to the occasion on which, the complainant said, the appellant had first raped her (which she placed as in about June 2007). Her evidence was that she and the appellant had a pact not to drink alcohol but that the appellant had, notwithstanding that pact, gone out with Mr Blyton and Mr Blyton's then girlfriend, Lorraine, and another person. She said that the appellant repeatedly telephoned her during the course of the evening, sounding intoxicated, and asking her to join them. She refused. She said that he returned home, intoxicated, they argued, and he raped her. 

148In his first statutory declaration, Mr Blyton referred to a night in mid August 2007 when, he said, he was with a group of people that included the appellant and the complainant and Lorraine. In his subsequent statutory declaration he added that: 

""... the night the alleged rape took place ..."" 

was: 

""... the one and only time that [the appellant] had ever met or seen"" 

Lorraine. 

149Mr Blyton's oral evidence was to similar effect. He said that the group, including the complainant, had gone to a hotel together, but the complainant left early and went home. The appellant remained, and ultimately returned to Mr Blyton's home where he stayed the night. He repeated that this was the only occasion on which the appellant had met Lorraine. If that were so, the appellant claims, the complainant's allegation of rape on that night can be seen to be false. Plainly, that would affect the jury's assessment of the complainant's credibility. 

150In my opinion, Mr Blyton's evidence could not have advanced the appellant's defence. First, Mr Blyton's account fixed the occasion of the outing as August 2007, while the complainant fixed the date of the rape as June of that year. That of itself may be of relatively little moment. However, the complainant's evidence was that, on the night of the rape, she had not been in the company of the appellant and he had gone out without her. That suggests a different occasion. It is true that Mr Blyton said both in his statutory declaration, and in his oral evidence, that the appellant had only met Lorraine on one occasion. This is critical to the import of his evidence because it could have established that the appellant was not at the Birriga Road apartment on the occasion the complainant alleged the appellant had raped her. But that evidence would not be admissible in a trial. Mr Blyton would not be permitted, even if his evidence were accepted as fresh evidence, to say that the occasion of which he spoke was ""the night the alleged rape took place"". 

151The principles on which fresh evidence may be admitted on a conviction appeal have been considered on a number of occasions: see, for example, R v Gallagher [1986] HCA 26; 160 CLR 392 ; Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259; R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417, and see Howie and Johnson, Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW , Butterworths, [20-270]. Fresh evidence is evidence that was not available to the accused at trial. Mr Blyton's evidence does not meet that test. 

152However, some latitude is permitted and, ultimately, the test is whether any miscarriage of justice has been shown. No such miscarriage is shown. 

153Even if admitted, Mr Blyton's evidence could not alter my view of the strength of this ground. No miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the absence of Mr Blyton's evidence. 

Ground 2: incompetence of counsel 

154The appellant complains that he was incompetently represented, and that his counsel failed to follow his instructions. At one point in his argument he went further and alleged that the failings ""could not have been accidental"". Just what he intended by this he never spelled out. 

155The principles applicable to the determination of a ground of appeal raising alleged incompetence of counsel were settled in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. Those principles include: 

"" 2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention."" (p 685, per Gleeson CJ) 

156Earlier, Gleeson CJ had said: 

""As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case."" (p 683) 

157The Chief Justice cited, and plainly accepted, a passage from Halsbury's Laws of England , 4 th ed, Vol 3(1), par 518 at 420 which is in the following terms: 

""... a barrister is ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted. Unless and until his instructions are withdrawn, counsel has, with regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, unlimited authority to do whatever he considers best for the interests of his client. This authority extends to all matters relating to the action, including the calling and cross-examination of witnesses, challenging a juror, deciding what points to take, choosing which of two inconsistent defences to put forward, and even to agreeing to a compromise of the action, or to a verdict, order or judgment."" (p 684) 

158The decision in Birks was essentially endorsed by the High Court in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124. There, Gleeson CJ said: 

16 It is undesirable to attempt to be categorical about what might make unfair an otherwise regularly conducted trial. But, in the context of the adversarial system of justice, unfairness does not exist simply because an apparently rational decision by trial counsel, as to what evidence to call or not to call, is regarded by an appellate court as having worked to the possible, or even probable, disadvantage of the accused. For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered, or wise. And it is not the role of a Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate such decisions in order to decide whether they were made after the fullest possible examination of all material considerations. Many decisions as to the conduct of a trial are made almost instinctively, and on the basis of experience and impression rather than analysis of every possible alternative. That does not make them wrong or imprudent, or expose them to judicial scrutiny. Even if they are later regretted, that does not make the client a victim of unfairness. It is the responsibility of counsel to make tactical decisions, and assess risks.""

159Many of these remarks are particularly apposite to the issues raised by the appellant. 

160The material presented by him on his own behalf in support of this ground is extraordinarily diffuse, lengthy, repetitive, and, most of the time, difficult to follow. The material consists of: 


a handwritten affidavit that extends over 135 pages; this affidavit bears the date ""1 st July"" but does not specify the year; 

a second undated handwritten affidavit of one page; 

a third affidavit, typewritten, dated 28 July 2010, of a little over two pages; 

two handwritten statutory declarations made by Peter John Blyton (referred to above) dated respectively 26 July 2010 and 16 August 2010; 

one handwritten, undated, page headed ""Submissions""; 

a document, handwritten, of 34 pages, headed ""Outline of appellant's submissions"", undated. 

161The appellant gave oral evidence and was cross-examined, as did and was Mr Blyton. Mr Jeffreys and his former employed solicitor, Ms Anne Green, provided affidavits and gave evidence in the Crown's case. 

162The material in the very lengthy affidavit of 1 July concentrated to a very large degree on instructions the appellant claimed to have given to Mr Jeffreys. To the extent that what he asserts related to factual matters concerning his relationship with the complainant, and the events surrounding (but not including) those of 2 January, Mr Jeffreys accepted that the substantial part, although not the entirety, of those instructions had been given. (It will be seen that I have restricted these comments to instructions on ""factual matters"". That is to distinguish such instructions from instructions the appellant claims to have given Mr Jeffreys with respect to the manner in which the trial was to be conducted. I will come to the latter in due course.) 

163By way of example, the appellant asserted that he had instructed Mr Jeffreys of the following facts (I have generously paraphrased from the appellant's affidavit): 

(a)that only one security key to the Birriga Road apartment block was in the possession of himself and the complainant, that the complainant had taken that key with her to Goulburn, leaving him without access (unless some other resident admitted him) to the apartment block, that the complainant told him that, if he wanted the key, he would have to travel to Goulburn to retrieve it, and that that was his only reason for undertaking that trip. (The appellant does not say when the complainant told him that, but I note that the complainant travelled to Goulburn on or about 22 December, and the appellant did not do so until Christmas day, 25 December); 

(b)that he did not obtain the complainant's parents' address from a computer or electoral roll search, but that the complainant had given it to him; 

(c)that the Christmas present to which the complainant referred in the text message of 17 December was a fluffy toy cattle dog, which he produced to Mr Jeffreys and which Mr Jeffreys had in his possession at the time of the trial; 

(d)that he had not pulled out a clump of the complainant's hair, and that the complainant's hair loss that was observed by the hairdresser was caused by an adverse reaction to a ""cheap and nasty"" hair product that she had purchased at ""Priceline""; 

(e)that, on 24 August 2007, the complainant had purchased for him a baseball and baseball bat; that this was a surprise gift, to remind him of a time he had lived in New York City and because he liked baseball; 

(f)that the telephone calls between himself and the complainant over Christmas were related to issues involving the documentary ""Plastic Fantastic"" (other than, perhaps, one call when the complainant wished him a happy birthday); 

(g)that the appellant had never wished to have a baby with the complainant; 

(h)that, on the walk from Birriga Road to Double Bay on 2 January to inspect the room for rent, the appellant and the complainant walked side by side with the complainant talking all the way; and that, after inspecting the room on that day, the appellant and the complainant stopped for coffee; 

(i)that the room for rent at Double Bay had a particularly pungent and unpleasant odour, and that this was the reason for the lack of communication between them that was observed by Mr Smith; 

(j)that, early in the morning of 2 January, the appellant had purchased a Sydney Morning Herald for the purpose of searching for an apartment; 

(k)that the ""Bosley"" referred to in the complainant's letter of 22 October was in fact a rabbit (the point the appellant sought to make from this was expanded; it was that, in the letter, the complainant envisaged ""sharing her life journey"" with Bosley, that, while rabbits have an expected life span of 7 years, Bosley was 4 years; that the complainant's expectation of ""sharing her life journey"" with Bosley was indicative of mental instability); 

(l)that, when Bosley did die, the complainant placed him in the freezer, that she intended to eat him in order ""to continue the bonding process"", and that she accused the appellant of murdering Bosley with his bad energy and witchcraft; 

(m)that when the appellant protested to the complainant about the physical condition of two rabbits she kept in a cage in the apartment, she threatened him that if he notified the RSPCA, she would call the police and report that he had raped her, and that police would accept her account because they hated the appellant and would arrest and incarcerate him; 

(n)that the complainant had not given the appellant the letter of 22 October, but that he had found it accidentally, and that she had pleaded with the appellant not to leave her, and not to move to Queensland as he contemplated, that she would stop threatening to report him to police and would seek treatment for her continual mood swings; 

(o)that the complainant told the appellant that she was alcoholic, suffered from extreme bipolar disorder, and that she herself considered that the diagnosis ought to have been schizophrenia; 

(p)that the complainant had frequently hidden the appellant's own anti-depressant medication; 

(q)that the complainant had threatened suicide, showing the appellant a plate of about 50 tablets; 

(r)that the complainant was able to ""cry on command [or demand]"" and boasted of her capacity to do so, and in fact demonstrated her talent to the appellant; 

(s)that the complainant had stolen the appellant's deceased mother's jewellery, plus several (or five) thousand dollars in cash, but that when he told her he intended to report this to police, she again threatened to accuse him of rape; 

(t)that, on the occasion on which the complainant alleged that the appellant had first raped her, they had been out as a couple with Mr Blyton and others, and that he (the appellant), but not the complainant (who went home) had stayed overnight at Mr Blyton's home, and had not been at Birriga Road; 

(u)that 2 January was the only occasion on which he had ""slapped"" the complainant, and that, on that occasion, he did so in self-defence; 

(v)that, when they walked from Birriga Road to Double Bay, the complainant was wearing her (sun)glasses; 

(w)that, during the course of their relationship, the appellant regularly took the complainant out to various elite restaurants for dinner; 

(x)that a neighbour, Mr Simon Overall, had visited the complainant's apartment and seen the complainant and the appellant together in circumstances that suggested a relationship different from that portrayed by the complainant; 

(y)that, for many months before the trial, the appellant, who was in custody, was extremely depressed and having trouble with his memory, was very fatigued, and constantly very cold, and that he did not feel able competently to give evidence in the trial. 

164The above by no means exhausts the matters about which the appellant claims he instructed Mr Jeffreys. The essence of his complaint is that, notwithstanding that he had given explicit instructions to Mr Jeffreys on these matters, Mr Jeffreys failed to cross-examine the complainant with respect to them. In respect of a relatively small number of these factual matters, Mr Jeffreys denied that the instructions asserted had been given. I would accept his evidence. Where there is a conflict of fact (and the areas of conflict of fact are relatively limited) I prefer the evidence of Mr Jeffreys. As mentioned above, to a substantial degree, Mr Jeffreys acknowledged that factual instructions along the lines claimed had been given to him. He said that, in the course of the trial: 

""I exercised my forensic judgment ... in a way that, subject to my various duties as an advocate, I believed would give the appellant the best chance of acquittal."" (affidavit, 8 September 2010, para 4) 

Mr Jeffreys said that, at the conclusion of his cross-examination of each witness, he consulted the appellant as to any additional matters the appellant wished him to raise, and, having taken those instructions, made his own judgment on whether or not further to cross-examine. 

165In fact, in respect of many of the items identified above, Mr Jeffreys did cross-examine the witnesses, principally the complainant. As to other items (for example, the rabbits referred to in para [162](m)) he said that he considered the subject matter ""too dangerous"" because there was, in the brief, conflicting material that the Crown may have adduced if he had ventured into that territory. The conflicting material was a claim by the complainant that the appellant had admitted to her that he had killed Bosley. 

166Mr Jeffreys denied that the appellant had instructed him of any incapacity to understand the trial process, or give a reasonable account of himself. I would accept that evidence. Mr Jeffreys produced a copy of written instructions from the appellant that he did not wish to give evidence in the trial. That document is dated 16 December 2009, the second last day of the trial. However, it is apparent that, throughout, there was a real likelihood that the appellant would not give evidence. That raises another consideration in relation to some of the matters about which the appellant now complains the complainant was not cross-examined. Forensically, to challenge a complainant about evidence that she has given, and to put alternative or additional propositions of fact to her, without supporting those propositions of fact, is a difficult and dangerous course for an advocate to take. The advocate knows that the jury will inevitably be directed that the evidence is what is elicited from witnesses, or contained in exhibits, and not what comes from the mouth of the cross-examiner. A litany of propositions put to a witness, not then supported by evidence, is very likely to provoke an adverse response from the jury. Where an accused is unlikely to, or is not going to, give evidence, an experienced advocate may well consider that prudence dictates a limit on the factual issues raised by way of challenge, particularly where they are of material relevance to the events the subject of the charge(s). That is even more so where there is no account, in, for example, a record of interview, given by the accused person. Here, the appellant have never given his own account of the events in question. Whether or not that was Mr Jeffreys' reasoning does not matter (he gave no explicit evidence to that effect). The fact is that the absence of cross-examination on these matters is unlikely to have reflected adversely on the appellant's prospects of acquittal. 

167There were also a small number of areas of fact upon which the appellant focussed in his argument, that formed no part of the evidence in the trial. One example, to which the appellant referred more than once, is an assertion concerning a threat by the appellant to throw acid in the complainant's face. No such evidence was given in the trial. I infer that the appellant drew this material from the contents of statements with which he had been served. It is, of course, correct that Mr Jeffreys could have elicited those assertions, for the purpose of painting the complainant as untruthful, even mentally unstable. But to do so would involve a particularly risky forensic tactic and one that a prudent advocate, especially knowing that his/her client was unlikely to give evidence, would be very hesitant to take. 

168Another matter to which repeated reference was made by the appellant concerned a statutory declaration said to have been made by the complainant, in which the appellant's former surname was contained (or, on another view, blacked out), but which asserted that the appellant's father had threatened to take out an Apprehended Violence Order against the appellant. That document never found its way into evidence, and the appellant's current complaints about Mr Jeffreys' conduct of the trial in this respect are entirely without foundation. The appellant also made a complaint that the jury, if it knew that he had changed his surname, would be likely to regard him with suspicion. There was a document (part of Ex 5) in evidence, and some cross-examination of the complainant that elicited the fact that the appellant had changed his surname, but that was innocuous. 

169The appellant also complained that Mr Jeffreys had inadequately taxed the complainant about the circumstances of his travelling by taxi to Goulburn on Christmas Day, for the purpose, he said, of retrieving the security key to the apartment block. 

170It is, in my opinion, highly unlikely that the jury would have regarded the appellant's version as credible, even if the appellant had given evidence of it, and far less so when he did not. At the time Mr Jeffreys made the decision not to cross-examine the complainant to this effect (leaving aside the extent to which the complainant could be asked to give evidence about the appellant's motivation in travelling) he must have known that the probability was that the appellant would not give evidence. Following the instructions the appellant now claims that he gave would have involved Mr Jeffreys putting before the jury, without evidence, a palpably improbable hypothesis. To decline to take that course, in the exercise of professional judgment, is not evidence of incompetence. 

171The appellant made a number of additional complaints about the conduct of the trial by Mr Jeffreys. He asserted, for example, that he had ""clearly instructed"" Mr Jeffreys to present the fluffy toy (see para [162] above) to the complainant in cross-examination and suggest to her: 

""That a fluffy toy is not something that she would purchase for a man who had twice raped her, threatened to throw acid in her face, threatened to murder her parents by gutting her father like a fish, violently yanked a clump of hair from her head, stalked her all over Bondi Junction, and generally caused her to exist in a state of constant terror, doing what she had to do to survive as she put it."" 

172The appellant asserted that Mr Jeffreys was instructed to cross-examine the complainant about the odorous nature of the Double Bay room that they had inspected. There are many more examples of instructions the appellant claims to have given Mr Jeffreys about the manner in which he ought to conduct the trial. It is unnecessary to prolong this judgment by repeating them. As the passages from Birks and TKWJ above show, these are decisions peculiarly within the province of the advocate. A skilled advocate will be ready to sense the mood of the trial and abandon subject matters of cross-examination if it appears that to pursue them would be futile, or worse. There is no basis for the appellant's complaint that Mr Jeffreys failed to cross-examine in the manner he purported to direct. 

173The appellant also attacked Mr Jeffreys for his failure to locate and call Mr Blyton. Mr Jeffreys denied that he was instructed to obtain a statement from Mr Blyton. I would accept Mr Jeffreys' denial. It is clear from what I have written above (see Ground 1) that, had he done so, Mr Blyton's evidence could not have advanced the appellant's case. Those parts of it upon which the appellant placed most reliance were inadmissible. 

174The appellant made a range of other generalised complaints. For example, he complained that Mr Jeffreys' then employed solicitor (and his then wife) had conferred with him in custody, by way of preparation, but had wasted the resources of the Legal Aid Commission by discussing with him, at length, her personal affairs. These matters could not remotely advance his case. 

175I find nothing in the matters raised that support the appellant's claim that he was incompetently represented, or that any failure by Mr Jeffreys to comply with instructions resulted in a miscarriage of justice. I would reject ground 2 of the appeal. 

176It follows that I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 

Sentence 

177The appellant (as I shall continue to refer to Mr Monteiro) seeks leave to appeal against what he asserts is the manifest excess of the sentence imposed in respect of the aggravated sexual assault offence, and the malicious damage offence. The Crown exercised the right conferred by s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal against what it asserts to be the manifest inadequacy of that sentence. 

178The appellant was, immediately prior to the trial on the sexual assault offence, indicted on two further charges, one of intentional damage to property (""malicious damage"") and one of stealing property. This was done in the absence of the jury panel. The appellant entered pleas of guilty to each charge. The malicious damage charge was brought under s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900; the stealing charge was brought under s 117 thereof. Each carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. 

179The aggravated sexual assault charge carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and, pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

180On the malicious damage count, Norrish DCJ sentenced the appellant to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and 8 months, and on the stealing charge he sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year and 9 months, to be served concurrently, each commencing on 8 January 2008. On the aggravated sexual assault charge, he sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 11 years, made up of a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 8 April 2009, and accumulated on the property offences by 1 year and 3 months. The result was a total effective sentence of 12 years and 3 months, commencing on 8 January 2008, and expiring on 7 April 2020, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months, expiring on 7 October 2015. 

Malicious damage and stealing offences: the facts 

181These offences were committed in the aftermath of the sexual assault, sometime after 1.00am on 4 January 2008. At that time police attended the Birriga Road apartment in order to serve a telephone interim order on the appellant. They were unable to gain access, but were able to observe that the apartment appeared to be intact. When they returned later in the morning and made a forcible entry, the apartment had been extensively damaged. By his plea of guilty to the property charges, the appellant acknowledged that he was responsible for the damage. 

182He threw paint, soy sauce and dirt throughout the apartment, onto the floor, the walls, the ceiling and furniture. He emptied a fish tank, causing the fish in it to die. He filled a bath with books belonging to the complainant, and left the shower running. He upended and slashed furniture. He emptied plants from pots. He tore up photographs. He cut up rugs and cushions. He splashed paint on the complainant's artworks, on blinds and statues, a television cabinet, and squirted oil into a DVD and a video player. In the bedroom, he pulled the mattress from the bed and slashed it, and slashed a throw rug and some of the complainant's clothing. He cut a large painting and splashed paint on the blinds. The complainant estimated the value of the damage to her property to be $14,750. The owner of the apartment stated that the cost of repairs was $1140. 

183The appellant stole from the apartment various items, including a number of Buddha heads and other decorative items, kitchen equipment, clothing, and electronic equipment. 

184Photographs in evidence demonstrate the level of wreckage perpetrated by the appellant. 

Evidence relevant to sentence 

185For reasons not apparent, sentencing proceedings did not take place until 3 April 2009. By then, Norrish DCJ had available to him extensive evidence concerning the appellant's personal circumstances, although the appellant himself did not give evidence. Documentary evidence consisted of a more than usually comprehensive Pre-Sentence Report, prepared by Probation and Parole Officer Kenneth Stevenson, three psychiatric reports, (two from Dr Bruce Westmore, and one from Dr Gordon Davies), and two psychological reports from Mr Anthony Diment. Oral evidence was given by Mr Stevenson, and by Mr Roland Lowe, the appellant's father. The evidence given by the appellant went, in part, to matters relevant to sentence. 

186The appellant's personal history was essentially common to all reports, from which the following emerges. The appellant was born Simon Lowe in December 1966, the youngest of three sons from his parents' marriage. His mother died from melanoma when he was 2 years of age. He then lived with his grandparents for about 2 years. His father re-married, and the appellant's relationship with his stepmother was not positive. Even at the time of his consultation with Mr Stevenson, he harboured and expressed deep resentment of her. Of course, the extent, if any, to which this animosity was justified is impossible to assess. The appellant also spoke of emotional abuse by his father, and of excessive physical discipline. 

187Mr Lowe told Mr Stevenson that, at age 12, the appellant had accidentally been given ""a double dose"" of diphtheria vaccination and that this precipitated a decline in his behaviour. (It is of more than passing interest that, in his evidence, Mr Lowe made a similar claim, but fixed the diphtheria injection as having occurred when the appellant was ""12 months "" old, before which, Mr Lowe said, the appellant had been ""an ideal child"".) 

188Mr Lowe also told Mr Stevenson that, at the age of 12, the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder, and medicated for the following three years. The appellant claimed to Mr Stevenson that this was a misdiagnosis, but acknowledged that he had experienced severe mood swings as a child, and an unrecognised (and unmedicated) mental illness. 

189As a child, the appellant exhibited what must have been quite severe behavioural difficulties, resulting in his admission, at an unspecified age, to Rivendell, a psychiatric institution for adolescents, after which he went to another residential facility, conducted by the Order of St John of God. There is evidence that he attended another residential facility, but this is not very clear on the evidence. The appellant has since claimed that he experienced a level of abuse (which he has specifically asked not be documented) while in one of these facilities. In his evidence, Mr Lowe confirmed that he had had some suspicion that something was untoward during the time of the appellant's residence in that facility. 

190The appellant left school and home at the age of 15, but has, nevertheless, obtained a commercial pilot's licence. He told Mr Stevenson that he has held a variety of other forms of employment, as an actor, filmmaker and model. He has lived in the United States and in Brazil, in the latter of which he has said to have a daughter. He told Mr Stevenson that, while living in the USA in the late 1980s, he was diagnosed as suffering from bipolar disorder and a borderline personality disorder, and that he has a history of depression and anxiety. The appellant also told Mr Stevenson that he had been treated by Justice Health for bipolar disorder, but Mr Stevenson noted that this does not accord with Justice Health records, which state that there is no evidence of mania or major depression, but that the appellant's presentation is consistent with narcissistic personality style. (That is not consistent with Dr Davies' report, with which I will deal below.) 

191Mr Stevenson reported that the appellant had told a drug and alcohol corrective services worker that he had used cannabis from age 14 to 39, ecstasy from 25 to 27, and cocaine from 23 to 39. 

192The appellant has, throughout, denied the sexual assault offence. He maintained that denial during the course of all of the interviews. He admitted to Mr Stevenson, however, that he has an anger management problem. 

193The appellant's conduct in custody up to the time of sentencing had resulted in four charges of institutional misconduct; two of intimidation, one of assault and one of obstruct correct officer. The details of these were not explored. 

194While in custody, the appellant has regularly referred himself to psychiatric and psychological facilities, alcohol and other drugs and welfare workers. He had been described by care workers as ""belligerent, agitated, self entitled, abusive"", and demanding, and failing to accept responsibility for his actions. 

195He was assessed as at moderate to high risk for recidivism. However, as Mr Stevenson suggested, since the appellant had declined to participate in the assessment, it may be of limited value. Mr Stevenson reported that the appellant did not appear to take responsibility for his actions, described the complainant as ""vindictive"", said that he had been ""set up"" for the sexual assault conviction, showed no remorse or empathy for the complainant and had stated that he would refuse to participate in any sex offenders' treatment programme. Mr Stevenson therefore concluded that the appellant was not prepared to address his offending behaviour. 

196Dr Davies has been the appellant's treating psychiatrist since February 2008 (that is, since he has been in custody), and has seen him quite regularly since then. He considered that the appellant's history of symptoms was suggestive of Attention Deficit Disorder, and observed (in his report) that the appellant ""appeared slightly grandiose and paranoid"", and not overtly depressed. He made a firm diagnosis of bipolar disorder. This is in contrast to what Mr Stevenson drew from the records to which he had access. Dr Davies expressed the opinion that: 

""... it is almost certain that his illness was a significant factor in [the] genesis"" 

of the offences committed by the appellant. The appellant maintained to Dr Davies that he was not guilty of the sexual assault offence. 

197Dr Westmore recounted a similar history. He diagnosed: 


mood disorder; 

substance and alcohol abuse (both in remission); 

possible conduct disorder arising in adolescence; 

significant personality dysfunction; 

probable personality disorder, with possible anti-social qualities, borderline characteristics, fragile personality structure. 

It is to be noted that he did not explicitly diagnose bipolar disorder. 

198Dr Westmore considered that the appellant's loss of his mother at an early age, with no substitute maternal figure, would have impacted on his personality development. 

199After receiving further information Dr Westmore again reported, on 13 March 2009. He adhered to his earlier opinion concerning mood disorder, and said that the clinical notes with which he had been provided strongly suggested the presence of significant ""personality difficulties/disorder"". 

200Dr Anthony Diment is a consultant psychologist who interviewed the appellant on 26 February 2009 over a three hour period, and administered various tests. He noted that, even during the interview, the appellant's mood swung from ""high intensity"" to a slower phase. He had above average levels of anxiety and depression. 

201The appellant has a criminal history which began in 1981 in the Children's Court with an offence of stealing. Thereafter, the history records a number of offences of dishonesty, assault, property offences, and some Listening Device Act offences. There is one count, in 2002, of supply prohibited drug, in respect of which the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months and one, in 2004, of stalking or intimidating with intent to cause fear or physical or mental harm. In respect of this offence the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 12 months which was suspended. 

202His most recent offences, as shown on the conviction history, were in 2004, of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and destroy or damage property. In respect of each of these a 2 year good behaviour bond was imposed. This is of some importance. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

203The Remarks on Sentence are lengthy and comprehensive. Norrish DCJ recounted at length the relevant factual circumstances of all offences, and stated the facts that he found proved and that were relevant in relation to the sexual assault charge. He was quite satisfied that the marks on the appellant's legs that he showed police on his arrest on 8 January had nothing to do with the complainant. He considered that the subsequent property offences, of malicious damage and theft, were ""very vindictive indeed"", and perpetrated ""as an act of revenge and intimidation"", to ""cause [the complainant] ... maximum hurt in the emotional sense"". He noted that the appellant had not sought ""in any way whatsoever"" to express any remorse, even in relation to the property offences, which he admitted. 

204His Honour spent a good deal of time recounting the appellant's history, including his criminal history, his drug use and abuse, and his problems with anger management. He noted the psychiatric and psychological evidence. He accepted, to a limited degree, a submission that the appellant is susceptible to some danger in custody, and, although unsupported by evidence, that the appellant was serving his sentence in ""strict protection"" (although he expressed some doubt about what that meant). 

205His Honour turned his attention to s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act (which specifies aggravating and mitigating features that a sentencing judge is required to take into account), and noted that a number of the aggravating features there specified had been proved. These were that substantial emotional harm had been caused to the complainant (s 21A(2)(g)); that the use of a weapon had been threatened (s 21A(2)(c)) (the weapon being the scissors, although the finding was limited to the complainant's fear of the use of the weapon); that there was some (although limited) planning of the offence, which, he said, also had ""an element of opportunism""; and that the offence was committed in the home of the victim (s 21A(2)(eb)). In addition, his Honour took into account that the offence was committed while the appellant was at conditional liberty (s 21A(2)(j), (see below)). Finally, he rejected a Crown submission, made under s 21A(2)(d), that the appellant's record of previous convictions was an aggravating feature. So far as the record was concerned, he held merely that it disentitled the appellant to leniency. 

206His Honour correctly held that there were few (if any) mitigating features, the only one of which he found established being the absence of any level of planning. 

207Since the offence is one to which Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act (imposing standard non-parole periods for certain offences) applies, it was necessary for Norrish DCJ to determine where, on a scale of objective seriousness of offences of its kind, the sexual assault offence fell. He noted submissions made on behalf of the appellant that, by reason of the prior relationship between the appellant and the complainant, the offence fell below the mid-range. He noted that this was ""not a typical or common case"", and questioned the effect of the prior relationship between the appellant and the complainant. He concluded: 

""... that the conduct here does reach to the cusp of the mid-range of the seriousness but I am not prepared to conclude that it does fall within the mid-range. But [it] is very close."" (ROS 40) 

208He gave consideration to the question of the appellant's mental illness, making express reference to the decisions of this Court in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 and R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36], and the impact that mental illness may have on a sentencing decision. 

209Of some significance, he said: 

""I have got no evidence of any relevant illness that contributed to the commission of the sexual assault matters (sic)"" (ROS p 30) 

(This was incorrect: see para [196] above.) 

210His Honour, following the reasoning in Engert , found that the appellant's mental condition fell ""far short"" of what is necessary in order to reduce the weight to be given in sentencing to considerations of general deterrence. 

211Pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, Norrish DCJ found that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the statutory proportions between the head sentence and the non-parole period. These were, particularly, the appellant's need to receive professional assistance to adjust to community living, as evidenced by ""his recalcitrant attitude"". 

212Norrish DCJ had available to him sentencing statistics provided by the Judicial Commission of NSW. The limitations in the use of such statistics are well known and do not need to be restated: see Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [54]. All the statistics provided related to cases decided after the introduction of standard non-parole periods in Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 

213The Remarks on Sentence extend over 44 pages. At their commencement, the transcript records the appellant interrupting Norrish DCJ. It is apparent, from the closing pages, in which his Honour referred to ""the continual interruptions from the prisoner during the course of these remarks"", that that continued. His Honour considered the impact of those interruptions. However, he had already announced the sentences he intended to impose, and he did not depart therefrom in the sentences he did finally impose. 

The appellant's application for leave to appeal against sentence 

214The appellant specified the grounds of appeal against sentence in the following way: 

""Sentences - manifestly excessive. Should run concurrent. 

Sentences - medical mitigation, and strict protection not taken into consideration in sentencing. 

hardship as child not taken into consideration by Judge Norrish. 

IE [here the appellant complained of what he said was a response by the sentencing judge during the course of submissions concerning the mistreatment of the appellant in one of the juvenile residential facilities to which I have referred above] that comment alone demonstrates a prejudicial attitude towards me by Judge Norrish when sentencing me. He showed his hand, so to speak!"" 

215In support of his application the appellant filed an affidavit, dated 22 July (no year is given, but presumably 2010) which extends over 15 handwritten pages, and contains a number of annexures. 

216The appellant complained of not having received material relevant to his appeal (eg ""police brief, subpoenas and transcripts), and said: 

""The whole issue is ridiculous and starting to read like a B-grade soap opera."" 

217He complained that his inability to obtain ""sentencing guidelines"" was inhibiting his preparation and was unfair. The complaints which followed were many and diversified. He complained of the manner and nature of transportation from prison to court; he complained of an assault he alleged had been committed on him by prison officers; he complained that after court appearances prisoners received only a cold meal and no rations for the following day; he complained that the prison system was not focussed upon rehabilitation, that staff are ""overwhelmingly apathetic""; he complained that conditions and treatment of prisoners are ""largely inhumane"". He gave a critique of the NSW prison system, and the flaws in its rehabilitation programmes, and made suggestions for an improved penal philosophy. 

218He asserted that he was serving his sentence as a protected prisoner and that, for the past 2 years, he had been locked in his cell for 22 or 23 hours a day. He complained that he had been forced to share a cell with cigarette smokers, and complained of what he said was the filthy condition of the cells and the beds provided. He complained about his legal representation during the trial and sentencing proceedings. 

219He then asserted that he suffered from a number of medical conditions, including a chronic back and neck condition causing severe pain, and that he had not been provided with an orthopaedic mattress which had been recommended for him. He said that he suffers from depression, a thyroid deficiency requiring hormone medication for which he had not been issued with the appropriate medication. He asserted that he had been the subject of a front-page article in a Sunday newspaper and that this had resulted in his repeated assault, and threats and intimidation. It was for this reason that he had been housed in protection. He complained that he had sought to enrol in a yoga correspondence course, but that the representative of the Academy at which the course was conducted had been told that he was not eligible because he was a rapist. His complaint about this was two-fold: that he had been thwarted in his attempt to undertake the course, and that information about his personal circumstances had been unethically disclosed. He went so far as to claim that the disclosure had damaged his future ""economic"" prospects, and possibly prevented his access to ""pain relieving practices"", as well as breaching his right to privacy. He complained that he did not have access to a particular medication for haemorrhoids, and declared ""garbage"" the explanation (that it was a medication used by inmates to make home brew alcohol) given for its non-availability. 

220He claimed that, by reason of his medical conditions, particularly his back and neck pain, and depression, incarceration weighed more heavily upon him than on other prisoners. 

221In response to all this, the Crown filed an affidavit sworn by Mr Terry Murrell, the Superintendent of Offender Management and Operation of the Department of Corrective Services, and an affidavit affirmed by Dr Stephen Hampton, Clinical Director of Primary and Women's Health at Justice Health. Mr Murrell also gave oral evidence. 

222Mr Murrell reviewed the appellant's incarceration history. He said that, on 24 June 2010, the appellant had allegedly assaulted a staff member, and this resulted in his re-classification, and placement on a segregation order (which was revoked on 30 July 2010, when the appellant was transferred to the Goulburn Correctional Centre). He confirmed that the appellant was, at the time he swore his affidavit, subject to a Protection Requested Limited Association (""PRLA"") order and had, in the past, at his own request, been subject to Special Management Area Placements (""SMAP"") orders. 

223He said that, because these arrangements had been made at the appellant's request, his access to other inmates and facilities was a matter for local management determination, but that the appellant usually had about 3 hours of exercise out of his cell per day, and was housed in a cell by himself, both because he had so requested, and because of threats he had made to harm his former cellmate and officers of Corrective Services. He explained that the appellant had not been granted access to the yoga instruction course for policy reasons concerning potential work with students, together with the nature of the offence for which the appellant was serving a sentence. He denied that the appellant was refused a shower or a hot meal on days when he attended court. 

224Dr Hampton set out the appellant's medical history while in custody, and the medication and other treatment which was afforded to him. He said that he had seen psychiatrists on many occasions. That accords with what is contained in Dr Davies' report. Dr Hampton confirmed that the appellant had been diagnosed as suffering from a thyroid deficiency, and said that he is receiving appropriate treatment for the condition. 

225In written submissions the appellant made the following complaints: 

(i)that the property offences had originally been charged in the Local Court, and he ought to have been sentenced under the more lenient sentencing regime that there applies; he suggested that the offences had been removed to the District Court maliciously, in order to ensure a harsher penalty; 

(ii)that all sentences should have been made to run concurrently; 

(iii)alternatively, that the sentences for the property matters should have been specified to run concurrently; 

(iv)that the sentence imposed in respect of the malicious damage offence was ""far too harsh"" when considering comparable sentences, and that the sentencing judge was biased against him; 

(v)that the sentencing judge commented that there was no evidence that he was a ""PRLA classification inmate"" or, if so, how long he was likely to remain so, and that he was, at the time of the submissions, still so classified; 

(vi)that his status as a ""PRLA inmate"" impeded his access to recreational activities and educational facilities; 

(vii)that the sentencing judge did not take into account his medical conditions, particularly his thyroid condition because evidence of this only became available after his incarceration; 

(viii)that the sentencing judge gave inadequate consideration to his bipolar disorder, because he remarked, during sentencing submissions, that a condition of bipolar disorder ""doesn't make him necessarily mentally ill""; 

(ix)that the sentence imposed in respect of the sexual assault offence was in the top 20 per cent of sentences for such offences imposed after trial. 

226As to the first of these, I accept that, where offences may be dealt with in the Local Court, it is sometimes appropriate to take into account the jurisdictional limits on sentencing in that court. Here, however, the malicious damage offence was an extremely serious example of its kind and it would scarcely have been appropriate, even if it were not linked with the sexual assault offence, to have charged it in the Local Court. I would reject this ground of the application. 

227As to concurrency, the sentences imposed in respect of the property offences were specified to be served concurrently. It is not quite true, as the appellant argues, that all offences were ""part of the same crime spree"". The sexual assault offence was committed in the afternoon of 2 January, the property offences at some time during the morning of 4 January. It may be inferred that, as Norrish DCJ found, the property offences were related to the sexual assault, in the sense that there were committed out of revenge (either for the complainant leaving him, or, more likely, out of his recognition that she had reported the assault to police). Far from reducing his culpability in relation to those offences, that circumstance aggravates them. The property offences were well separated in time from the sexual assault, and were committed when the appellant had had ample time to consider his position, particularly in respect of the sexual assault offence. In my opinion it would have been erroneous not to have specified some degree of accumulation; the accumulation of 15 months was entirely appropriate. 

228As to the appellant's protected status, Norrish DCJ acted on the evidence available to him. It was quite true to say that he did not know how long the appellant was likely to remain so classified. It is now well established that the mere fact that a sentence is being served on protection does not automatically result in a mitigation of the penalty. Evidence as to the precise impact of that classification is required. 

229The principles relating to the admission of fresh evidence in relation to sentence are substantially those, already discussed, that relate to appeals against conviction. These were recently examined in R v Kertebani; Kertebani v R [2010] NSWCCA 221. Where in an application for leave to appeal against sentence it is sought to adduce fresh evidence, the evidence may be admitted if its purpose is to cast new light upon facts that were in existence at the time of the imposition of sentence, but not known to the sentencing judge, or further to explain facts that were known: R v Smith [1987] 44 SASR 587 at 588. See also R v Ehrenburg (NSWCCA, 14 December 1990, unreported ); R v Ashton [2002] NSWCCA 498; 137 A Crim R 73. 

230Fresh evidence is not admissible to establish the occurrence of events, or the existence of circumstances, that post-date sentencing: R v Willard [2001] NSWCCA 6; 120 A Crim R 450 . 

231As I would infer that the appellant's thyroid condition was in existence at the time of sentencing, although not diagnosed and therefore not know to him or to Norrish DCJ, it does appear that the appellant's thyroid condition qualifies as fresh evidence, not available to the sentencing judge, and which it would be appropriate for this Court to take into account. It does not, however, amount to evidence that could or should affect the assessment of the excessiveness of the sentence imposed. The thyroid condition is being treated, as Dr Hampton has made clear. I would reject this basis of the application. 

232The comment (concerning bipolar disorder) to which the appellant refers was made during the course of argument and does not form part of the reasons for the selection of the sentences. I would accept that bipolar disorder is a mental illness. Moreover, although it was not part of the appellant's argument, I consider that his Honour did make a factual error in overlooking the opinion, expressed with some force by Dr Davies, that the appellant's mental illness had a causal relationship with his offending. 

233Although it has not been raised by the appellant, having regard to his unrepresented status, it is appropriate here to deal with the finding that the offence was committed while the appellant was at conditional liberty. I have been unable to find any evidence of that, and the account, given above, of the appellant's history would suggest that it is erroneous. It does not appear from the criminal record that he was at liberty conditionally. Certainly no support was provided for the finding: but that may be because it was not challenged by the appellant. In any event, I will bear this in mind when I come to considering the asserted excessiveness or inadequacy of the sentence. 

234The appellant placed particular reliance upon one set of statistics. These showed that, of 14 convictions, after trial, of offences against s 61J of the Crimes Act that incurred non-parole periods or fixed terms, the lengthiest non-parole period imposed was 9 years; in only 21 per cent of cases were non-parole periods of 6 years or more imposed. 

235Norrish DCJ made particular reference to this statistic, noting that the mean non-parole period appeared to be of about 4 years, but expressed appropriate reservations, given the absence of any detail as to the facts of the matters and the conclusions reached by the sentencing or appellate courts. 

236I would reject the appellant's contentions concerning the statistical material. As his Honour observed, the statistics themselves tell little about the reasons for the sentence ultimately imposed. 

237I would, however, make this tentative observation. All of the cases that contribute to the statistics were of offences of the same kind as that committed by the appellant; and each offender was convicted after trial. Not one was sentenced to the standard non-parole period of 10 years; the vast majority (71 per cent) were sentenced to non-parole periods of significantly less than half the standard non-parole period. It would be very surprising indeed if that proportion of the total number of offences were of significantly less than the mid-range of objective seriousness, or had other circumstances warranting such a substantial departure from the (statutorily decreed) standard non-parole period. The figures would suggest, on the contrary, that Pt 4 Div 1A is not being applied with the rigour that is due to a regime imposed by Parliament. 

238Notwithstanding that I consider that two errors are apparent, both sentences were well within the range available to the sentencing judge. The sentence imposed in respect of the sexual assault offence was not manifestly excessive. When measured against the standard non-parole period, it was very lenient indeed. Only a very generous application of the principles relating to mental illness could possibly have justified departure of such magnitude from the standard non-parole period. Neither was the sentence imposed in respect of the malicious damage offence exercise. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 

The Crown appeal 

239The following grounds of appeal were pleaded by the Crown: 
""Ground 1: His Honour failed to impose a non-parole period that complied with his findings as to the objective seriousness for the purpose of addressing the standard non-parole period. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in his approach to the medical evidence. 

Ground 3: His Honour was inappropriately guided by sentencing statistics. 

Ground 4: His Honour made too great an adjustment to the ratio in relation to his finding of special circumstances; 

Ground 5: His Honour erred in imposing a sentence that is manifestly inadequate."" 

240As I understand it, the Crown bases its appeal substantially upon the degree to which the non-parole period imposed (6 years and 6 months) departs from the standard non-parole period (10 years). This is a case in which, because the appellant was convicted after trial, Pt 4 Div 1A directly applies: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. The standard non-parole period is to be imposed unless the sentencing judge finds that there is a basis for departure. One available basis is that the offence committed is of less than the mid-range of objective gravity. The sentencing judge did find that the appellant's offence was of less than mid-range gravity, but only marginally so - it was on ""the cusp of the mid-range""; he was not prepared to conclude that it fell within the mid-range - but added that it ""is very close"". 

241Such a finding would justify at most only a minimal reduction in the non-parole period. That is, of course, unless there are other circumstances that justify a greater departure. His Honour did not expressly identify any other such circumstances. 

242It was, it seems, in order to support this ground that the Crown hypothesised (expressed as Ground 3) that his Honour gave too much weight to, or was ""inappropriately guided by"" sentencing statistics. 

243A glance at the Remarks on Sentence establishes that his hypothesis cannot be sustained. His Honour, as I have said above, expressed appropriate reservations about the sentencing statistics, noting, in particular, that he had no information about the facts and circumstances of the cases constituting the statistical material. 

244In fact, as I have said above, in the context of the appellant's application, the statistics in this case tell little - other than that sentencing patterns do not appear to be in accord with statutory requirements. I would therefore reject Ground 3. If there was error, it was not caused by undue reliance on sentencing statistics. 

245I do accept (notwithstanding my rejection of Ground 3) that no proper basis was identified for the significant departure from the standard non-parole period. 

246However, there were the two errors in the Remarks on Sentence to which I have already referred - conditional liberty, and the causal relationship between mental illness and the commission of the offences. Each of these was capable of operating to the disadvantage of the appellant in the sentencing exercise, but favours him in the appeal. Were it not for the second of these, I would conclude that the Crown appeal ought to be allowed, and the sentence increased and increased to something very close to the standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

247In this context, it is also necessary to consider the impact of the finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which does, of itself, justify a reduction from the standard non-parole period. (The Crown does not challenge the finding of special circumstances, merely the extent of the variation between statutory proportions that resulted). 

248If the standard non-parole period of 10 years were imposed then, in accordance with s 44(2) and absent a finding of special circumstances, a head sentence of 13 years and about 3 months might be expected. 

249Three circumstances are relevant to determining whether or not the sentence was manifestly inadequate. The first is the finding of special circumstances, warranting modest downward departure from the standard non-parole period (but not relevant to the head sentence). The second and third, both relevant specifically to the head sentence, but having, by reason of s 44(2), a flow-on effect to the non-parole period, are the erroneous finding that the offence was committed while the appellant was at conditional liberty, and the overlooking of Dr Davies' evidence that there was a causal connection between the appellant's mental illness and the commission of the offence. Although, in my opinion, a reduction in the standard non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months - a reduction of 35 per cent - is very generous indeed, it is not so generous as to warrant the intervention of this Court. 

250Put another way, had those errors not been made, the sentencing judge may well have arrived at a sentence within the vicinity of that imposed. 

251For these reasons, I would dismiss the Crown appeal. 

252The orders I propose are: 

(1)Appeal against conviction dismissed. 

(2)Leave to appeal against sentence granted, appeal dismissed. 

(3)Crown appeal dismissed. 

253HOEBEN J: I agree with Simpson J. 

254PRICE J : I agree with Simpson J.

		18 May 2011",2011-05-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2756997,R v Hawi & ors (No 5) [2011] NSWSC 1651,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown proposes to tender before the jury 20 pages, each containing photographs and other identifying information relating to the 12 Comanchero and 8 Hells Angels who were at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009. Each page, insofar as they concern the seven accused, contain still photographs taken from CCTV footage at the airport, photographs taken at some time subsequent to 22 March 2009, and some ""biometric details"", that is, age, height and weight if known. 

2The Crown Prosecutor proposes to tender as an exhibit during her opening address a folder containing various maps, plans and photographs and it is proposed to include the 20 pages to which I have just referred. Objection is taken on behalf of some of the accused to the admissibility of some of the photographs and so it is appropriate to resolve such objection now so that the compilation of the jury folders may proceed. 

3Objection is also taken by Mr Driels, counsel for the accused Potrus, to a photograph of his client that is included in a PowerPoint presentation that the Crown proposes to tender. This is a series of still images taken from CCTV footage at the airport. It has various captions and labels designed to assist the jury to understand who and what is depicted. The PowerPoint presentation has been compiled from the footage from a number of CCTV cameras and the idea, as I understand it, is to provide such a compilation in a chronological order so that the jury can better understand the events which occurred in their proper sequence. 

4The image that Mr Driels is concern with is a head and shoulders, face to camera, photograph of Mr Potrus which has a line connecting it to a figure in a CCTV still that depicts seven men. The purpose appears to be to identify the figure indicated to be Mr Potrus and so there is the photograph with his name underneath it. I was acquainted with this by the Crown providing me with a printout of the PowerPoint presentation. It is not intended that the jury will be provided with this printout, but the Crown will tender a disc containing a recording of the presentation. I suppose, however, that when the jury replay this recording in the jury room, it will be open to them to stop or pause on particular slides in order to make a closer examination. For this reason it is appropriate to approach this issue as if what was being tendered was a still photograph of Mr Potrus. 

5If the subject of this judgment is of any relevance at a later time, I record that oral submissions were made by counsel on 11, 16 and 17 May 2011. Written submissions dated 13 May 2011 were also provided by the Crown Prosecutor. Exhibits on what I have called the ""admissibility of photographs voir dire"" are the 20 photographs of the Comanchero and Hells Angels members who were at the airport on 22 March 2009 (Exhibit A); the PowerPoint printout (Exhibit B) and statements by witnesses identified by the numbers 9 and 48 (Exhibit K1). 

6Before dealing with the objections taken on behalf of each accused it is useful to note the nature of descriptions given by some of the eyewitnesses. I have taken the following sample from the Crown's written submissions: 

Witness 300 witnesses the fatal assault upon the deceased. He describes a man on the ground attempting to fend off his attackers. He describes a man assaulting him with a bollard as being: ""Lebanese, 6'4"", muscular, looked like steroid user, dark coloured short hair, long in back, tattoos on arms, dark coloured singlet and grey tracksuit pants."" 

Witness 3 was working at a check in counter when she saw two men running towards her. One, chasing another male, was muscular, tall, had a tattoo on right bicep. 

Witness 77 saw a man assault [the deceased] with a silver stand. The male was: ""6', big build, well built, middle eastern appearance, olive skin, short dark hair, coloured tattoos around both biceps, ripped tshirt, tracksuit pants, running shoes"". 

Witness 42 saw a male swing a bollard down on [the deceased] twice and describes him as follows: ""very tall about 6'5""m olive skin, dark short shaved hair, short sleeved yellow coloured shirt, tattoos in blue/pink amongst darker colours, they were from elbow to shoulders, dark coloured track pants"". 

Witness 21 heard yelling coming from the economy check in, looked and saw men running towards doors, between check-in counters. One was wearing a dark grey singlet and had tattoos all down his arms. 

7It is also worthwhile noting that no objection was taken by senior counsel for the accused Menzies to the page concerning his client. It includes two photographs showing tattoos on his left and right lower arms and another photograph showing an ""ACCA"" tattoo on the front of his neck. Evidence elsewhere indicates that ""ACCA"" is an acronym for ""Always Comanchero, Comanchero Always"". 

8No objection was taken by senior counsel for the accused Eken to the page concerning his client either. The photographs do not depict any tattoos or any other matters of concern. 

9No counsel objected to the pages concerning the other Comanchero and Hells Angels members who were present at the airport. Photographs of Mr Costa show that he is heavily tattooed on both arms, his left shoulder and his left chest. Mr Aouli is shown wearing a long-sleeved shirt with sleeves rolled up with no visible tattoos. Mr La Rosa has both upper arms heavily tattooed. Tattoos on both arms and across the chest are shown in the photographs of Mr Pirini. There are tattoos extending down the length of SP's left arm as well as tattoos on the back of the neck and on the right upper arm. AL is shown to have discrete tattoos on both arms but they are not as extensive as others. Mr Ovalle has a heavily tattooed right upper arm but no visible tattoos elsewhere. Mr Peter Zervas has a tattoo of the words ""Hells Angel"" on his upper chest, a heavily tattooed left upper arm and chest, and a tattoo on his right forearm. There are no photographs, apart from CCTV still images, of the deceased and the Hells Angels members, Messrs Wainohu, Baker, Martin and Khoury 

The accused Hawi 

10Mr Grant objected to some of the photographs on the page that concerns his client, Mr Hawi. No objection was taken to three photographs taken from CCTV footage. They show Mr Hawi standing or walking somewhere in the airport. The images are grainy and blurred but are sufficient to show that he was dressed in a white T shirt with black writing on the front and white long trousers. 

11The objection is concerned with three photographs that were taken on 6 April 2009. One photograph is a head and shoulders, face to camera image. An elaborate tattoo is apparent on his left shoulder/upper chest which continues up the left side of his neck. Another photograph, which is of his right arm, shows a tattoo on the upper arm. A photograph of his left side shows that the tattoo shown in the first photograph on the left neck and shoulder/upper chest in fact continues down his arm almost to the elbow. There is another tattoo on the left side of his abdomen. 

12The objection is based upon a contention that there is no probative value in the evidence concerning the appearance and location of tattoos on Mr Hawi's body. There emerged in the course of submissions something of a dispute as to whether any witness will give evidence of something being done by a person that the Crown alleges was Mr Hawi by the witness making reference to the person having, or not having, tattoos. I indicated to the Crown Prosecutor that in order for me to resolve this issue I would need to be provided with some detail as to the evidence that would give the question of Mr Hawi having tattoos some probative value. Written submissions dated 13 May 2011 were subsequently provided by the prosecutors. 

13Aside from the assertion that the evidence has no probative value, Mr Grant submitted that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial to his client. He submitted, ""Some people don't like tattoos, and they form adverse views about people who do have tattoos"" (T192.40). I indicated to him that community attitudes to tattoos appear to have evolved and that there are some popular and admired people these days who are heavily adorned with them. Mr Grant responded, ""That may be the case, but we have somebody who is said to be the national president of the motorcycle club, heavily tattooed, all of those prejudices are reeking out in relation to it"" (T193.1). 

14The written submissions of the Crown identify a number of ways in which the evidence of Mr Hawi's tattoos is relevant. The witness presently identified by the number 159 is expected to give evidence about the behaviour of a man on the flight from Melbourne to Sydney. The Crown says this man was Mr Hawi. The witness described the man's appearance as including that he was Middle Eastern, solid build, 20-30 years of age, about 5'10"" tall, with short dark hair which was short on the sides but less so on top. That is certainly a description that the jury could find matches Mr Hawi. The witness described the man's clothing in similar terms to that which Mr Hawi was wearing, albeit with some discrepancies. Significantly for present purposes, the witness said that the man had tattoos across the back of his neck and was heavily tattooed on the right arm and across the shoulders. That is a description the jury might accept was of Mr Hawi, if it was prepared to accept that the witness was mistaken and that it was the left arm and shoulder that was heavily tattooed rather than the right. 

15The Crown referred to the evidence expected to be given by witness 41. She was seated near to Messrs Hawi, Menzies and Eken on the flight. She provided police with a sketch of the tattoo on the man seated in 44D which, on the Crown case, was Mr Hawi. The witness' description of the man was that he had short dark neat hair; he was 6 foot tall and had a ""huge muscly build""; and there was a tattoo of swirls from his shoulder that went down his arm and filtered into his hand. The sketch, and the description, are each capable of being regarded by the jury as a likeness of Mr Hawi's left arm tattoo. 

16Witness 41 saw part of the gate 5 affray and observed the person who had been in seat 44D grab a man who the Crown asserts was Mr Padovan in a fashion that resulted in his t-shirt coming off. She later saw the same man near [Padovan] attempting to hold him on the ground. She described the fight between this man and [Padovan] to be the ""main fight"". The witness gave evidence at the committal hearing that she also saw the man from seat 44D punching [Padovan] (T 1352). 

17Witness 40 saw a man who the Crown alleges was Mr Hawi punch the president of the Hells Angels at the commencement of the Gate 5 affray. She described his physical features in a manner that could be regarded as being consistent with Mr Hawi. In addition, she said that he had a tattoo which was of diagonal lines that started on his right shoulder and went down to his bicep and ended at about the elbow. That could be regarded as an apt description of the tattoo on Mr Hawi's left arm. The witness said that the man had another tattoo on his left arm but she could not tell what it was. Mr Hawi has a tattoo on his other arm but it is less prominent. 

18Another witness to the Gate 5 affray, witness 217, saw two men approach and punch a third man who the Crown says was Mr Padovan. The description given of one of the men included that he had a tattoo on his neck, as Mr Hawi does. 

19Witness 92 described a man on the flight in terms capable of being regarded as consistent with Mr Hawi. The description included that he was ""heavily tattooed"". He described this man as ""aggressive in demeanour"". He later saw the same man after the affray and described him as ""agitated and his clothing was tousled"". 

20In a pre-trial disclosure notice, Mr Hawi's representatives indicated that their client denied exhibiting animosity towards Mr Wainohu on the flight. There is no dispute that he had words with Mr Wainohu at Gate 5 but he denies involvement in the affray. The evidence of the witnesses to which the Crown has referred, if accepted, is capable of proving the contrary. 

21The witnesses' evidence in part depends upon the correctness of their descriptions of the man they saw. Given that it includes reference to tattoos, evidence of the location and appearance of Mr Hawi's tattoos is relevant. In this day and age I very much doubt that having tattoos reflects badly upon a person's character. Even if it might in Mr Hawi's case, any danger of unfair prejudice does not outweigh the probative value of the evidence. 

22The submissions of Mr Grant that I have referred to above were made on 11 May. He made further submissions on the subject on 16 May. Mr Grant submitted that the events in the departure hall, and particularly the assault upon the deceased, are ""what the trial is really about"" (T276.16). He described what occurred at Gate 5 as ""the side show of this trial"" (T276.35). Mr Hawi is charged with affray concerning the latter and he denies any involvement in it. Whether or not it is a ""side show"", given the pre-trial disclosure denials, it remains a matter for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt. 

23Mr Grant's submissions implicitly acknowledged that Mr Hawi's tattoos were relevant to the eyewitnesses' descriptions of events on the plane and at Gate 5 by saying that if the photographs were excluded, it would be incumbent upon the cross-examiner to be careful to avoid asking questions that would make the photographs relevant. Mr Grant then submitted that the written submissions for the Crown failed to identify any relevance of the tattoos to the descriptions of witnesses as to what occurred in the later incident in the departure hall. 

Conclusion as to the photographs concerning the accused Hawi 

24In my view, the photographs of Mr Hawi's tattoos are clearly relevant, at least, in relation to events on the plane and at Gate 5. It is, therefore, unnecessary to explore their relevance in respect of events in the departure hall. The photographs are admissible. 

The accused Abounader 

25In his submissions on 11 May 2011, Mr Trevallion, on behalf of the accused Abounader, indicated a possible objection to the page concerning his client. It has three rather blurred images from CCTV footage that are not objected to. Then there are four photographs taken on 3 July 2009 which show tattoos on Mr Abounader's right chest, back and each arm. Mr Trevallion indicated that he would speak with the Crown Prosecutor in order to see if there could be some resolution of his concerns (T195). 

26Subsequently, the Crown provided written submissions in which there was reference to the evidence of the witness identified by the number 301: 

Witness 301 was watching the riot between gaps in the counters and saw a group of men fighting, and states ""the man I remember was a pacific islander. He was the closest to me. The fight shifted through between the larger gap. The Pacific Islander I would describe as being 6 foot 2, muscular, thick set build, dark skin colour...and I believe there was an eagle tattoo. The tattoo was on either the upper portion of his chest or the upper portion of his back. He was twisting and turning, so I am not sure as to what side the tattoo was on. I do remember that the eagle tattoo had its wings outstretched."" Mr Abounader has an eagle on his back (but is neither an Islander nor 6 foot 2). 

27Mr Trevallion's concerns had not been allayed by the time the issue was revisited on 16 May. The four photographs of Mr Abounader taken on 3 July 2009 depict (1) a head and upper chest, face to camera, image showing a tattoo on the left upper chest and portions of tattoos on each upper arm; (2) an image of Mr Abounader's back, showing the word ""Comanchero"", then above that an eagle with its wings fully outstretched, then above that, on the back of the neck, the letters ""CMC""; (3) a side-on image of the left arm showing tattoos from shoulder to wrist; and (4) a side-on image of the right arm, also with tattoos from shoulder to wrist. What is depicted in the tattoos in images 1, 3 and 4 are extremely difficult to discern. 

28Concern was expressed about the word ""Comanchero"" on Mr Abounader's back. ""It may lead the jury to believe that he is a more dedicated or more company man, if I can use that term, and therefore more likely to blindly follow what the others are doing or his club president or other more senior members are doing"" (T265.50). I am not going to assume that jury members are stupid and irrational and so I reject that submission. I note, as well, that if there was any validity in this concern, it might also apply to the ""CMC"" on Mr Abounader's neck, but no objection was taken to that tattoo. 

29More to the point, Mr Trevallion submitted that no witness makes any reference to this particular tattoo and so it has no relevance. It was also asserted that Mr Abounader's instructions were that he did not have this tattoo on 22 March 2009 but that it had been acquired later. 

30The Crown Prosecutor agreed to modify the size of the photograph so that the word ""Comanchero"" is removed. The Crown maintained that all of the image of the tattoo of the eagle was admissible, regardless of whether there was evidence of Mr Abounader's shirt being removed, because of the description given by witness 301 and the fact that none of the other participants had such a tattoo. As to the submission that no witness saw Mr Abounader's shirt removed, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the singlet that he was wearing was loose fitting and may well have moved with him during the course of the events. 

31As to the tattoos on Mr Abounader's arms, it was asserted that some of these had also been added after 22 March. However, it was conceded that both arms were heavily tattooed as at that date and no witness purported to identify Mr Abounader by reference to any particular tattoo on his arms. Mr Trevallion, however, then conceded that ""the arms and front view is admissible"" (T268.16) but maintained his objection to portions of the photograph of Mr Abounader's back. 

32The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the images of the tattoos on the arms were admissible because witness descriptions included various references to men with a white singlet and tattooed arms. Some were, the Crown says, a reference to Mr Hawi, notwithstanding that he was wearing a t-shirt with very short sleeves. So, the Crown submitted, it was important that the jury had images of Mr Abounader as well in order for them to determine whether such descriptions referred to Mr Hawi, Mr Abounader, or someone else. 

33As to the photograph of Mr Abounader's head and shoulders, face to camera, it was submitted for the Crown that, as in the case of Mr Potrus and Mr Kisacanin, it was important for the jury to be able to familiarise themselves with the facial appearance of the accused. Looking at the men in the dock in the courtroom might enable the jury to acquire a familiarity with their facial features over time, but providing such photographs would hasten that task and enable the jury to assess the eyewitness descriptions of participants in the events from an early stage of the trial. 

Conclusion as to the photographs concerning the accused Abounader 

34In my view, all of the photographs of Mr Abounader are admissible, subject to modification of the photograph of his back that the Crown undertook to make. 

35It is not to the point whether witnesses actually describe a particular accused by reference to specific tattoos on his body. The fact that there is at least a description of one accused by reference to specific tattoos, coupled with the fact that there are other descriptions that make a more general reference to the presence, or the absence, of tattoos on a part of the person's body, makes it relevant for the jury to have photographs of each of the accused, and each of the other participants, in order that they may be able to distinguish between each man when they hear any such description given by a witness. 

36Further, it would be of no assistance, and perhaps misleading, if the jury were to have photographs of only some of the participants. It would be almost impossible for the jury to make a proper assessment of descriptions given by eyewitnesses if they were only able to make a comparison with the appearance of some, but not others, of the men who were present. 

37The same can be said in relation to the images of the facial appearance of Mr Abounader and the other participants. When witness descriptions include reference to some aspect of a person's facial appearance, such as the person's apparent racial origin, it will be of assistance to the jury to have an image of each of the 20 alleged participants to examine and compare. Being able to look at 7 out of the 20 alleged participants in the dock is no substitute for that. 

38The photographs of Mr Abounader, subject to the modification of that of his back, are admissible. 

The accused Kisacanin 

39The page concerning Mr Kisacanin has three CCTV images of him at the airport which show him wearing a singlet top and shorts. Objection was taken by Mr Gordon to three photographs taken on 17 February 2010 of Mr Kisacanin wearing a green singlet and green shorts. The objection is not concerned with tattoos, none are visible, but to the fact that Mr Kisacanin is shown dressed in prison clothing. I do not know whether it is generally known in the community that prison clothing is green but there must be a possibility that a juror would be aware. 

40The Crown's response to that concern was to indicate that it would remove two of the photographs that show Mr Kisacanin wearing green shorts as well as a green singlet but leave in the photograph that shows the singlet but not the shorts. 

41Mr Gordon also submitted that there was an issue in the descriptions of eyewitnesses as to the colour of singlets. The CCTV stills of Mr Kisacanin do not clearly depict the colour of his singlet because of the poor quality of the images. Mr Gordon took me to the statements of two of the eyewitnesses (Exhibit K1). The witness identified by the number 9 provided a description of a participant which included that the man was wearing a khaki coloured singlet. Witness 48 described a man wearing ""a short dark green/khaki coloured T-shirt"". As I understood the submission, it seems that these witnesses were not describing a man who the Crown contends is Mr Kisacanin. However, given the description of the colour of the man's (or the men's) upper garment, a photograph of Mr Kisacanin wearing a green singlet would be ""an invitation to speculate ... dangerous ... and prejudicial rather than probative"" (T281.38). 

42The Crown Prosecutor indicated, however, that it is proposed to tender the singlet that was worn by Mr Kisacanin at the airport and so the colour of the singlet that he was wearing will be well known to the jury. She informed me that the singlet is dark grey. For that reason there would be nothing misleading about the singlet he was wearing when the subsequent photographs were taken. 

43It was also submitted by Mr Gordon that no witness purports to identify someone who the Crown asserts is Mr Kisacanin by facial features and therefore the image of his upper body and face has no relevance. It was also submitted that Mr Kisacanin's facial appearance was different as between 22 March 2009 and 17 February 2010. 

Conclusion as to the photographs concerning the accused Kisacanin 

44The appearance of Mr Kisacanin, including his face and, in his case, the absence of tattoos, is a relevant matter for the jury to take into account in the assessment of descriptions given by eyewitnesses for the same reasons I have indicated in relation to the appearance of Mr Abounader. If Mr Kisacanin's facial appearance changed between 22 March 2009 and 17 February 2010, it would only be in respect of facial hair. Any such differences can be pointed out to the jury. I cannot imagine the jury assuming that Mr Kisacanin's facial hair as shown in the later photographs must have been exactly as it was on 22 March 2009 in any event. 

45I am not persuaded that the probative value of the evidence of the photograph of Mr Kisacanin which shows him wearing a green singlet, but does not show his shorts, is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. There is a possibility, and it can be put no higher than that, that the jury will think that the photograph was taken while Mr Kisacanin was in custody. That would hardly come as a surprise in the case of a person charged with murder, riot and affray. I am not prepared to assume that the jury will act irrationally and be influenced in deciding the case concerning Mr Kisacanin by this fact. If Mr Gordon wishes me to give the jury any direction about this I will consider doing so. 

46The Crown's proposal to tender the actual singlet that Mr Kisacanin was wearing at the airport will remove any possibility that the jury will be misled about its colour and so I reject the submission that there is unfair prejudice for this reason. 

47The photograph of Mr Kisacanin taken on 17 February 2010 showing him wearing a singlet but not showing his shorts is admissible. 

The accused Potrus 

48Mr Driels objected on behalf of the accused Potrus, not to the rather blurred CCTV images of him but to three photographs of him taken on 16 October 2009. One shows simply his head and neck, face to camera. Mr Driels submitted that the jury will be able to see Mr Potrus in the dock and so this photograph has no probative value. The same submission applies to the head and shoulders, face to camera, photograph of Mr Potrus that is included in the PowerPoint presentation. 

49Objection was also taken to the other two photographs on the page concerning Mr Potrus. One shows the right upper arm, shoulder and chest which are covered by a tattoo. The other provides a side-on view of the right arm with a view of that aspect of the same tattoo. Mr Driels submitted that the photographs were taken on 16 October 2009 and there was no evidence that the tattoos had the same appearance, or were even there, seven months earlier. 

50The Crown Prosecutor obtained further instructions and ascertained that Mr Potrus did have a tattoo on his shoulder on 22 March 2009 but subsequently had it enlarged. Accordingly, it would be misleading to place before the jury photographs of the enlarged tattoo. 

51I understand Mr Driels submission also to have been that as it is not asserted that any witness identifies a person who the Crown says is Mr Potrus by way of tattoo, any photograph of tattoos, even if accurately depicting the tattoos that he had on 22 March 2009 would not be relevant. 

Conclusion as to the photographs concerning the accused Potrus 

52For the same reasons as I have indicated previously, any photograph that accurately depicts the appearance of Mr Potrus on 22 March 2009 is relevant so as to permit the jury to consider the descriptions of witnesses and determine for themselves whether the descriptions do, or do not, apply to a particular participant in the events in the departure hall. 

53There is nothing prejudicial about the head and shoulders, face to camera, photograph of Mr Potrus. It was taken some 7 months later but, as with Mr Kisacanin, any change in his appearance would be confined to hairstyle and facial hair and that can be pointed out to the jury. In any event, as with Mr Kisacanin, I cannot imagine the jury assuming that Mr Potrus' hair, and facial hair, as shown in the photograph of 16 October 2009 would be identical to how they were on 22 March 2009. 

54The photographs of Mr Potrus showing head and shoulders, face to camera, in the single page of photographs, and in the PowerPoint presentation, are admissible. 

55The two photographs showing his tattoos that are presently on the single page are not admissible because they do not depict their appearance on 22 March 2009. 

The accused Padovan 

56Mr Conwell objected to some of the photographs of Mr Padovan. There are two images from the CCTV footage which are not at all clear. One of them shows Mr Padovan walking with his right hand raised to about waist height and he appears to be looking at the back of his hand. Mr Conwell was concerned that the jury could misuse this photograph by inferring that Mr Padovan had recently punched something. He submitted that this image was not fairly representative of the entirety of the CCTV footage. I understand that the Crown is agreeable to substituting another still image from the CCTV footage that does not depict Mr Padovan in this pose. I will assume that will be done and so this aspect of Mr Conwell's objection need not be considered further. 

57There are three photographs of Mr Padovan taken on 7 July 2009. Objection is taken to two of them which show tattoos on the left chest, both upper arms and the left forearm. Mr Conwell submitted that they have no probative value. Mr Padovan lost his shirt in the events which occurred near Gate 5 and Mr Conwell said that there would be repeated references in the eyewitness evidence to ""the man without a shirt"". In other words, he is identified without reference to his tattoos. 

58A further dimension to Mr Conwell's objection was the nature of some of the tattoos. On the left chest are the letters: ""CRO-LEB"". He informed me that this was a reference to Mr Padovan's parentage, being Croation and Lebanese. Mr Conwell was concerned that this tattoo might be misinterpreted by the jury to be a reference to Cronulla and people of Lebanese origin, with reference to violent conduct that occurred at Cronulla in December 2005 involving people of Lebanese extraction. A tattoo on Mr Padovan's left upper arm has some lettering, the meaning of which eludes me, above and below a cross. Mr Conwell informed me that it was some benign religious phrase but was concerned that this ""could be played with by the jury as well"" (T199.15). 

59Mr Conwell did not have objection to the jury being informed in some fashion of the existence and location of Mr Padovan's tattoos. His concern about prejudice was confined to the lettering that might be misinterpreted. I raised with Mr Conwell the possibility that if the lettering in the tattoos was benign, the jury could simply be told that so that they would avoid any prejudicial speculation about the meaning. He accepted that this was a possibility but submitted that there was no probative value in the appearance of the tattoos in the first place because no witness, to his knowledge, identified the person who the Crown says was Mr Padovan by way of the appearance of his tattoos. 

60In further submissions on the topic, Mr Conwell added a concern about the photograph of Mr Padovan's arms and chest. Among the tattoos that can be seen is one on the lower left arm. It is extremely difficult to make out what is depicted, but Mr Conwell informed me that inside a large red diamond (that much is discernible) there is a ""1%"". 

61There is a reference to ""1%"" in the statement of Sergeant Ian Frater of 9 September 2009 that was tendered before me when the admissibility of evidence concerning the structure and organisation of the Comanchero motorcycle club was being determined. It, apparently, is a tag traditionally used by ""outlaw motorcycle gangs"" as an indication of a non-conformist attitude of a group who regards itself as being outside of mainstream society. 

62The Crown submitted that the images showing Mr Padovan's tattoos were relevant. It was relevant generally in showing the appearance of all participants to enable the jury to assess descriptions given by eyewitnesses. It also had specific relevance in relation to a particular witness who described a person who the Crown says was Mr Padovan: ""It's clearly him and in her statement (she) says he had no tattoos"" (T275.42). The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it was appropriate that photographic depiction of Mr Padovan's tattoos should be before the jury ""in order to assess whether that witness is a reliable witness or whether perhaps it's understandable given the position of his tattoos that she did not see him or otherwise describe him as having tattoos"" (T275.46). 

63The Crown indicated that it was prepared to reduce the size of the ""arms & chest"" photograph of Mr Padovan so that the lettering on the left chest, ""CRO-LEB"" was not legible and to remove the ""left upper arm"" photograph which shows the tattoo of the cross with some lettering. I will consider the matter on the assumption that this will be done. 

Conclusion concerning the photographs of the accused Padovan 

64Upon the assumption that the modifications foreshadowed by the Crown will be made, I am satisfied that the photographs of Mr Padovan are relevant. As with others, they are relevant to enable the jury to have a clearer understanding of his appearance, including his tattoos, so as to enable jurors to assess the descriptions given by eyewitnesses and determine, if possible, whether descriptions are, or are not, a possible reference to Mr Padovan. I cannot see any danger of unfair prejudice. 

65The photographs of Mr Padovan are admissible.

		09 February 2012",2011-05-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2756999,Regina v OM [2011] NSWCCA 109,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA: This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions ("" the DPP "") against a decision of his Honour Judge Finnane of the District Court on 31 st January 2011. The DPP appeals pursuant to section 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) or, in the alternative, pursuant to section 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act . 

Background 

2The respondent, OM, is charged with the following three offences: 

Count 1 : That on 28 th December 2008 at Wolli Creek in New South Wales, the respondent did intentionally damage property, namely a motor vehicle, the property of Easter Star Pty Ltd. 

Count 2 : That between 5 th January and 1 st February 2009, the respondent caused Mohit Sundarjee to provide false and misleading information to police with intent to pervert the course of justice. 

Count 3 : That between 5 th January and 5 th July 2009, the respondent caused Farah Ullah to provide false and misleading information to police with intent to pervert the course of justice. 

3Count 1 is brought under section 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) , and carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Counts 2 and 3 are brought pursuant to section 319 of the Crimes Act , carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 

Facts alleged 

4The charges stem, the Crown contends, from an incident on 28 th December 2008. The respondent was a passenger in a car driven by Ms Farah Ullah which unexpectedly pulled out in front of a taxi driven by Mr Ma. Mr Ma sounded his horn. When the two cars subsequently stopped at traffic lights, the respondent got out of the car, approached the driver's side window of the taxi and struck the glass, causing it to shatter. The respondent then ran back to the car, which drove off. A passenger in the taxi, Mr Mudford, managed to record the registration of the vehicle. Police were called, and took photographs of the incident. 

5Subsequent investigations led the police to Mr Sana Ullah, the registered owner of the vehicle. Mr Ullah nominated his daughter, Ms Ullah, as the driver on the day in question. Mr Ullah then informed his daughter of his contact with the police, who in turn spoke to the respondent. According to the summary of facts by the primary judge, Ms Ullah phoned the respondent and said, ""What is this about the police asking something about malicious damage to a taxi?"" He responded, ""let's not say anything over the phone, we have to meet up"". Later that day, the respondent met with Ms Ullah (and possibly Mr Sundajee, although Ms Ullah says in her statement given to police on 31 st May 2010 at [14] that she cannot be sure) during which the following conversation took place (statement on 31 st May 2010 at [15]):- 

Ms Ullah: What am I supposed to do, I'm supposed to go to the police station, what am I supposed to say? 

Respondent: Just say that Mohit was in the car with you. 

Ms Ullah: Why would you want to get Mohit involved, he's not going to take the fall for you. Why don't you just pay for the guy's window and it will be like $200. 

Respondent: No, it's already past that, the police are involved. If we all stick to the same story, this will just go away. 

6Ms Ullah spoke to the police on 19 th January 2009 and told them that she was indeed driving the car on the day in question, however she was with Mr Sundarjee. She told the police that she was unaware of any damage to Mr Ma's vehicle. Police again contacted Ms Ullah on 4 th June 2009. She then telephoned the respondent and asked him what to do, to which he told her not to say anything, and (if she does) that she cannot remember anything. Ms Ullah followed these instructions when again spoken to by police. 

7On 31 st May 2010, Mr Ullah provided a statement to the police in which she admitted that she was with the respondent on 28 th December 2008, that the respondent did smash the taxi window, and that he had asked her to make a false statement to police. Ms Ullah later pleaded guilty to concealing a serious indictable offence (under section 316 Crimes Act ) and was given a 12-month bond under section 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 before the Local Court on 1 st July 2010. 

8Mr Sundarjee, when questioned by police, said that, in mid January 2009, the respondent contacted him and said, ""do me a favour, if the Police ring you tell them you were with Farah on December 28 th from 2pm to 5pm at Coogee Beach"". When asked why by Mr Sundarjee, the respondent replied, ""I accidentally smashed a taxi driver's window because he was looking at Farah"". When contacted by police that same day, Mr Sundarjee gave the requested account. Mr Sundarjee subsequently told the respondent of his conversation with the police, to which he replied, ""it's ok, if we stick together the problem should go away"". Again on 16 th April 2009, Mr Sundarjee maintained the same account when spoken to by police. 

9On 8 th May 2009 Mr Sundarjee met the investigating police and provided a statement in which he admitted that he was not with Ms Ullah on 28 th December 2008, and had been encouraged by the respondent to provide the false accounts to the police in January and April 2009. The respondent was charged with these offences on 5 th October 2009. 

Proceedings before Finnane DCJ on 31 st January 2011 

10The trial was listed before the primary judge for hearing on 31 st January 2011. Mr Daleo appeared for the Crown, Mr Hanna for the respondent. Submissions had been previously prepared by both parties, with those of the respondent headed ""Application for advanced ruling pursuant to section 192 of the Evidence Act 1995 "". The thrust of the respondent's argument was that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal (comprising Bell JA, RS Hulme and Latham JJ) in Einfeld v R [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31 had clarified the scope of section 319 of the Crimes Act (headed ""general offence of perverting the course of justice""), with the result that the conduct of the respondent could not sustain charges two and three in the indictment. The final paragraphs of the written submissions were as follows:- 

25. The Crown does not assert that the accused's alleged conduct was performed subsequent to the institution of curial proceedings. Nor is there any evidence in the Crown case to support any such contention. 

26. In the light of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Einfeld v R , it is submitted that acts allegedly carried out by the accused fall outside the scope of the offence under s 319 of the Crimes Act. As a consequence, it is submitted that the Crown evidence, taken at its highest, is incapable of establishing a prima facie case against the accused. 

27. For the above reasons, it is respectfully submitted that the Court should make a ruling under s 192A of the Evidence Act that the evidence proposed to be adduced at trial of the accused is not capable of establishing a prima facie [case] against him. 

11The appellant also provided written submissions in the court below. These submissions expressly proceeded on the basis that the application was one to quash counts two and three in the indictment. Their final paragraph read:- 

The Crown submits that the alleged conduct of the Accused, as established on the evidence before the Court, is capable of constituting an act done with the intention to pervert the course of justice. Accordingly the Crown submits that the Defence application to quash counts 2 and 3 on the indictment should be refused. 

12The proceedings before the primary judge began with the following exchange:- 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Can I indicate, your Honour, this trial is listed for trial today. Mr Hanna put me on notice last week that he intended to make a preliminary application to the Court in relation to two of the three counts on the indictment which are charges of pervert the course of justice. As I understand, Mr Hanna is making an application that you will make an order that the Crown can't establish a prima facie case on counts 2 and 3. 

HIS HONOUR: So, you're hearing no evidence at all, just a preliminary matter? 

13The respondent was then indicted in terms of the subject indictment. After the respondent had pleaded not guilty to the three charges, the trial judge proceeded to hear the application. When asked what the basis of the application was, Mr Hanna said:- 

HANNA: Yes. Effectively, what the defence says is that the Common Law prior to 1990 and the insertion of Part 7 of the Crimes Act; the offence of perverting the course of justice and the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice were Common Law offences. The leading decision to consider the scope of those offences in the context of police investigations is that of Rogerson. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes? 

HANNA: It's not submitted, your Honour, that, had the statutory provisions not been created and that if the accused was charged with the now abolished Common Law offences, that he would have this argument available. Essentially what is now submitted, that in the light of the amendments, and, as considered most notably in the decision of Einfeld, that the scope of conduct which falls within the charge under s 319 has not simply been replicated (my emphasis) . And it has been, to a certain extent, by the decision of Einfeld; it is now submitted that where an accused person, or no persons have been arrested or charged and where it is merely a police investigation, or the conduct concerns the - 

HIS HONOUR: Can I have a look at the indictment, please? Thank you 

HANNA: -- where the alleged conduct merely pertains to police investigations or the activities of government bodies prior to the commencement of any curial proceedings or any actions which would amount to the commencement of the course of justice in criminal proceedings; that would be the charging of an accused person that falls outside the scope of s 319 . [my emphasis] 
... 

HIS HONOUR: Why is not trying to induce someone to give them false information perversion of the course of justice? 

HANNA: Well, it will essentially turn on your Honour's interpretation on the decision of Einfeld, it's the defence position that, in order for the CCA to be [sic] process of reasoning, where they ended in holding that the activities of government bodies are not included, is that police investigations are also - no longer fall within the scope of that section where no curial proceedings on foot. That's the defence position. 

14Following this was a discussion of the decision of Einfeld . The Crown then submitted:- 

So, as I understand it, Einfeld has said the administration of the law does not extend the statutory offence to something broader than it was under the Common Law, that the expression 'administration of law' has the same meaning as the phrase 'the course of justice' as explained in Rogerson. In Rogerson, the High Court said that whilst ordinary police investigations do not form part of the course of justice, where there is a circumstance where an offender has, in the contemplation that curial proceedings are possible or imminent for a particular offence and he does something to thwart them, that is just as much an act - as McHugh J said - 

15Following this submission, however, his Honour said:- 

Right, well, I don't think you have read the decision, or if you have read it, you have not understood the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Because what the Court of Criminal Appeal says is that the course of proceedings and the administration of law are precisely the same, and for it to be an act to pervert the course of justice, it has to be something done in relation to Court proceedings. There's nothing here done in relation to any Court proceedings; this is something done, if at all, at a preliminary stage in some police investigation into a summary matter... 

16A discussion of the first charge in the indictment then took place and his Honour appeared to draw oral submissions to a close:- 

HIS HONOUR: Well, there are two or three courses open; I can get a jury, which will be tomorrow morning, and I can wait until you finish presenting all your evidence and then direct a verdict. Or, I think I'm being asked to quash two counts on the indictment. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: As I understand-- 

HIS HONOUR: I can quash two counts on the indictment, leaving the other one to be dealt with by the jury tomorrow morning. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, your Honour, the Crown's submissions would be if you were to make the order to quash the two counts on the indictment, that the matter would be adjourned; the malicious damage be adjourned. I would anticipate the Director would want to consider his position in relation to an appeal. 

17Mr Hanna then reiterated his submissions in relation to the decision of Einfeld , and his Honour delivered a 7 page ex-tempore judgment. 

Decision of the primary judge 

18His Honour found in favour of the respondent's argument. His Honour's decision began:- 

Application has been made to me pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act that I should give a ruling or make a finding in relation to a question before evidence is adduced in the proceedings. Essentially what I am being asked to do is quash two counts on indictment. 

19His Honour next discussed the insertion of section 319 of the Crimes Act into the legislation and the facts of this case as he saw them, before turning to an analysis of the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in Einfeld . Following this analysis, his Honour said, ""In my opinion the effect of the decision of [ Einfeld ] is that this conduct, if proved, could not amount to being done with the intent to pervert the course of justice. That is my ruling"". The basis for this ruling appears to be from extracts of the judgment cited by his Honour, namely the Court's decision at paragraphs [87], [89], [90] and [99]. His Honour also referred to [98] and [99]. I will return to examine the correctness or otherwise of his Honour's analysis of the decision of Einfeld later. 

Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal 

20When the parties returned before his Honour the following day, Ms Daleo informed the court that the DPP had decided to lodge an appeal in relation to the ruling. The primary judge accordingly adjourned the matter for 3 months, allowing time for this appeal to be heard. 

21The appellant now appeals, firstly, under section 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act which provides:- 

Where the Supreme Court or the District Court has quashed any information or indictment or any count thereof or the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction, in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party, has quashed any application made under section 246 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 or any charge specified in such an application, or the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction, in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party, has quashed any application made under section 41 (1) of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 or any charge specified in such an application, the Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the order made, and such court may thereupon determine the appeal and if the appeal is sustained may make such order for the prosecution of the trial as may be necessary. 

22Mr Babb SC, who appeared for the appellant, submitted that, despite the respondent couching his application before the primary judge as a request under section 192A of the Evidence Act , the end result was, in effect, the quashing of counts 2 and 3 in the indictment, namely the attempt to pervert the course of justice charges. It is useful to set out the terms of section 192A of the Evidence Act :- 

192A Advance rulings and findings 

Where a question arises in any proceedings, being a question about: 

(a) the admissibility or use of evidence proposed to be adduced, or 

(b) the operation of a provision of this Act or another law in relation to evidence proposed to be adduced, or 

(c) the giving of leave, permission or direction under section 192, 

the court may, if it considers it to be appropriate to do so, give a ruling or make a finding in relation to the question before the evidence is adduced in the proceedings. 

23Mr Babb highlighted the fact that the application before his Honour, as framed, and in terms of section 192A, raised no question concerning the admissibility or use of evidence, the operation of the Evidence Act or any other law in relation to the evidence proposed to be adduced. Nor did it relate to the giving of leave, permission, or a direction under section 192. On the point of jurisdiction, Mr Babb referred to decisions establishing that, when characterising an order, it is necessary to look to its substance rather than its form (namely, R v Bozatsis & Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 304; Director of Public Prosecutions v PM [2006] NSWCCA 297; 67 NSWLR 46 at [54] - [59]). In this regard, the appellant emphasised what was said by the primary judge in his judgment (extracted above): ""essentially what I am being asked to do is to quash two counts on an indictment"". 

24In the alternative, the appellant based his appeal on section 5F(2) Criminal Appeal Act :- 

5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order 

(1) This section applies to: 

(a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, and 

(b) proceedings under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , and 

(c) proceedings in Class 5 of the Land and Environment Court's jurisdiction (as referred to in section 21 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 ). 

(2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies. 

25Senior Counsel argued that, if it were not, in effect, a quashing order, his Honour's ruling might properly be seen as a permanent stay of the proceedings on counts 2 and 3. As such, it would plainly be an interlocutory order permitting appellate intervention. 

26The appellant then raised two related grounds of appeal, first, that his Honour erred in finding that the evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown was not capable of establishing a prima facie case of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, and secondly that, as a consequence, his Honour erred in ordering, in effect, that counts 2 and 3 in the indictment be quashed. At the heart of this appeal, it will be seen, is the primary Crown allegation that his Honour misunderstood the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in Einfeld . 

27The appellant argued that Einfeld goes no further than holding that section 319 of the Crimes Act does not extend to conduct that is intended to obstruct, prevent or defeat a government body in the exercise of its functions in applying and enforcing any law of the State. It did not state, as found by the primary judge, that conduct which obstructs or deflects a police investigation can never constitute a charge under section 319 unless curial proceedings are on foot. To this extent, Mr Babb argued Einfeld recognised the continued applicability of the decision of the High Court in The Queen v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; CLR 268. Mr Babb pointed to the facts alleged in the present case, particularly the conversation between the respondent and Ms Ullah, quoted in paragraph [5] above. These were plainly capable, senior counsel argued, of establishing, on a prima facie basis, the offences alleged by the Crown. 

28Mr Campbell SC, for the respondent, placed his main emphasis on the jurisdictional point, submitting that this Court had no power under sections 5C or 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to allow the appeal. Mr Campbell argued that neither the quashing of two counts in the indictment, nor a permanent stay of proceedings, had ever been sought by the respondent. Nor did the primary judge make rulings or orders to that effect. All that was sought, it was submitted, was, in effect, an advance advisory ruling under section 192 of the Evidence Act from the trial judge as to the weight or effect of the evidence proposed to be adduced by the Prosecutor. To this end, the primary judge's conclusion did not have the necessary element of finality. There was nothing to prevent the Crown from proceeding to trial with the three counts still in the indictment. There was nothing to prevent the Crown from attempting to persuade the primary judge to depart from his earlier conclusion (the subject of this appeal). Senior Counsel submitted that, had his Honour remained of this view, he would have directed a verdict of acquittal on counts 2 and 3 at the conclusion of the Crown case. If that had happened, Mr Campbell submitted, no avenue of appeal would have been open to the Crown in relation to the directed verdict. (Although not necessary for the decision in this case, this last submission appears to overlook the provisions of section 107(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW)). 

29As to the merits of the primary judge's decision, Mr Campbell argued that, rather than holding that conduct which interferes with a police investigation where no court proceedings are on foot can never constitute a charge under section 319, what his Honour did was to hold that the evidence of the Crown in this case, if proved, could not meet what was held by the High Court in Rogerson to constitute ""the course of justice"" when curial proceedings were yet to be instituted. 

30It was submitted that, for a charge to be available against the respondent, the Crown had to prove that the police investigation had progressed to the extent to give rise to a particular course of justice. It had to prove that the respondent did, at the time of his acts, know of such an investigation, and that it might lead to criminal proceedings, and that he thereupon undertook his course of action knowing those proceedings would be perverted as a result. Senior Counsel argued that the acts of the appellant went no further than deflecting any police inquiry that may or may not arise - as opposed to intending to pervert the course of justice. The actions of the appellant, it was submitted, occurred well before the statements of Ms Ullah or Mr Sundarjee were obtained, and when the only information available to police was the registration number of the vehicle alleged to be involved in the incident with Mr Ma. In that regard, the Crown could not establish that Mr Mohammed had in contemplation any proceedings being brought against him. 

Resolution - First issue 

Scope of section 319 

31It is clear, in my opinion, that the primary judge was plainly in error in his understanding of the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in Einfeld . This error led his Honour to believe that section 319 had altered, in a significant respect, the accepted view of the scope of the common law offence of doing an act intending to pervert the course of justice. It did not. His Honour's mistaken view in this regard was the sole basis of the ruling he made. 

32In Einfeld , the Court of Criminal Appeal examined, in essence, two interrelated matters that arose for consideration. The first was the issue of whether the trial judge (James J) had erred in refusing to quash counts 1 to 5 in the indictment. These were counts alleging offences in terms of section 319 of the Crimes Act (""a person who does any act, or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice, is liable to imprisonment for 14 years""). In each case, the evidence relied on by the Crown related to the submission of a false statutory declaration to the Infringement Processing Bureau, arising out of a camera-detected traffic offence. James J had placed some reliance on section 312 of the Crimes Act , which dealt with the meaning of ""pervert the course of justice"" in these terms:- 

A reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law (my emphasis). 

33The point at issue before James J had been whether the phrase ""the administration of the law"" extended the scope of the offence beyond that as settled, for example, in the High Court's decision in Rogerson . There had been an earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal ( R v Subramanian [2002] NSWCCA 372), which had suggested that an accused's conduct in swearing a statutory declaration directed to the Infringement Processing Bureau was sufficient to ground an offence under section 319. 

34James J considered that the decision in Subramanian supported the view that the sending of a false statutory declaration to the Infringement Processing Bureau concerning the identity of the driver of a vehicle at the time of the offence was capable of amounting to an offence under section 319 by perverting ""the application [sic: the administration] of the law"". His Honour concluded, after analysis, that ""the making and sending of each statutory declaration to the Infringement Processing Bureau would be capable of amounting to perverting the course of justice, in the sense of perverting the administration of the law"". 

35The second related matter considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Einfeld , arising out of its focus on the proper interpretation of section 319, was the broader question as to whether section 312 extended the scope of the expression ""the course of justice"" as explained in Rogerson , or left it essentially as it was. 

36The court ultimately determined that James J had been in error in the determination he made. The court allowed the appeal and set aside James J's orders dismissing the relief claimed in the Notice of Motion before him. As a consequence, the court quashed counts 1 to 5 in the indictment. In so doing, it accepted the submissions made on behalf of Mr Einfeld that the evidence the Crown proposed to lead ""was not capable of establishing a prima facie case against him"". The issue raised by this submission had been identified by the Court of Criminal Appeal (at [21]) as:- 

Whether the offence of perverting the course of justice under section 319, by reason of the inclusion of the expression ""the administration of the law"" in section 312, extends to conduct that is intended in any way to obstruct, prevent or defeat a government body in the exercise of its functions in applying and enforcing any of the laws of this State. 

37On the broader issue, the court determined (at [99]):- 

In our opinion, the expression ""the administration of the law"" in s 312 is to be understood in the sense that we take Sir Samuel Griffiths to have used it in R v Nicholls and in the way it has subsequently been used in this area of legal discourse, which is the administration of the civil and criminal law by courts and tribunals. Understood in this sense, the expression differs little, if at all, from the expression ""the course of justice"" as explained in Rogerson . 

In reaching the conclusion it did, the Court of Criminal Appeal had regard to the history of the circumstances leading to the codification in New South Wales of Part 7 of the Crimes Act (dealing with ""public justice"" offences). It had regard also to the explanatory material before Parliament. It examined the situation in other states and territories where similar legislation had come into force. It applied the presumption against extending the scope of a penal statute, unless there were clear language to support it. It noted the perhaps unintended consequences that would flow from accepting the extension of the scope of the section, in that it would be likely to apply to all public officials (not just police). It gave by way of illustration the making of a false statement to a bus inspector, where a pass had been lost. 

38In the result, the court determined not to give the words ""administration of justice"" their literal meaning, noting that, to do so, would not fit ""harmoniously"" within the scheme of the legislation and, in particular, Part 7, where offences against public justice were carefully ranked in order of seriousness. In the course of its decision, the court indicated that it would not follow the obiter statements in Subramanian , principally because those remarks did not represent conclusions reached after full debate and deliberation. 

39Given the clear conclusion in Einfeld , it is necessary next to examine the scope of the offence (perverting the course of justice) as it had been explained in Rogerson . In particular, it is necessary to consider the situation where a person is charged with the offence (as the respondent was here) involving the deflection of a police investigation prior to the institution of proceedings. It was that situation that Finnane DCJ thought could not substantiate the offence created by section 319. 

40Rogerson was a case where three men had been charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The charge arose out of an alleged agreement to fabricate evidence which had as its object the frustration or diversion of a police investigation into the possible commission of a crime. The court held, firstly, that investigations by officers of the law of actual or suspected crimes are not part of the course of justice for the purpose of the common law offences concerned with perverting the course of justice. Mason CJ, in a passage that is referred to by the court in Einfeld at [52], put the matter in the following terms, at 276: 

It has been suggested that ""the course of justice"" and ""the administration of justice"" include police investigations as such. True it is that some judicial comments are capable of being understood as lending support to that bald proposition. These comments have been made for the most part in cases in which a person has been convicted of an attempt to pervert the course of justice by misleading police in their investigation of a crime or suspected crime. 

But police investigations do not themselves form part of the course of justice. The course of justice begins with the filing or issue of process invoking the jurisdiction of a court or judicial tribunal or the taking of a step that marks the commencement of criminal proceedings. In James v Robinson Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ stated: ""The proposition that proceedings are pending in criminal cases after a person has been arrested and charged is firmly established."" 

I therefore agree with the rejection by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Todd of the proposition that the course of justice under consideration includes the investigation by the police of facts for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a crime has been committed. 

In this respect, it is important to note that the expression ""the course of justice"" is synonymous with the expression ""the administration of justice"". In no relevant sense do the police administer justice, notwithstanding that they investigate crime, institute prosecutions (where appropriate) and assist in bringing prosecutions... 


41Mason CJ rejected secondly the view that the course of justice begins to run as soon as a crime is committed. He then stated at 277 - 288:- 

The fact that police investigation stands outside the concept of the course of justice does not mean that, in appropriate circumstances, interference with a police investigation does not constitute an attempt or a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. 

It is well established at common law and under cognate statutory provisions that the offence of attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice at a time when no curial proceedings are on foot can be committed ( Regina v Murphy (1985) 158 CLR 596 at 609). That is because action taken before curial or tribunal proceedings commence may have a tendency and be intended to frustrate or deflect the course of curial or tribunal proceedings which are imminent, probable or even possible . In other words, it is enough that an act has a tendency to frustrate or deflect a prosecution or disciplinary proceeding before a judicial tribunal which the accused contemplates may possibly be instituted, even though the possibility of instituting that prosecution or disciplinary proceeding has not been considered by the police or the relevant law enforcement agency . So, in Kalick v R (1920) 55 DLR 104, at 109, it did not matter whether the police officer intended to institute a prosecution; it was sufficient that, being apprehensive of a prosecution, the accused gave a bribe to prevent it. Action taken to prevent the institution of a prosecution is as much an interference with, or impairment of, the administration of justice as action taken to obstruct the conduct of a prosecution after it has been commenced (my emphasis). 

Accordingly, I agree with Brennan and Toohey JJ that an act which has a tendency to deflect the police from prosecuting a criminal offence or instituting disciplinary proceedings before a judicial tribunal, or from adducing evidence of the true facts, is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice and, if done with intent to achieve that result, constitutes an attempt to pervert the course of justice and can ground the offence of conspiring to pervert the course of justice (my emphasis). 

42Brennan and Toohey JJ said (at 280):- 

The course of justice is perverted (or obstructed) by impairing (or preventing the exercise of) the capacity of a court or competent judicial authority to do justice. The ways in which a court or competent judicial authority may be impaired in (or prevented from exercising) its capacity to do justice are various. Those ways comprehend, in our opinion, erosion of the integrity of the court or competent judicial authority, hindering of access to it, deflecting applications that would be made to it, denying it knowledge of the relevant law or of the true circumstances of the case, and impeding the free exercise of its jurisdiction and powers including the powers of executing its decisions. An act which has a tendency to effect any such impairment is the actus reus of an attempt to pervert the course of justice. An act which effects any such impairment is the actus reus of a perversion of the course of justice. 

43At 283, Brennan and Toohey JJ said: 

Although police investigations into possible offences against the criminal law or a disciplinary code do not form part of the course of justice, an act calculated to mislead the police during investigations may amount to an attempt to pervert the course of justice. An act which has a tendency to deflect the police from prosecuting a criminal offence... or from adducing evidence of the true facts is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice and, if done with intent to achieve that result, amounts to an attempt to pervert the course of justice. It impairs the court's capacity to do justice in the actual circumstances of the case (my emphasis). 

44Later, their Honour's added:- 

The gravamen of the offence of an attempt to pervert the course of justice is an interference with the due exercise of jurisdiction by courts and other competent judicial authorities. As the courts exercise their necessary and salutary jurisdiction to hear and determine charges of offences against the criminal law only when their jurisdiction is invoked, an act which has a tendency to deflect the police from invoking that jurisdiction when it is their duty to do so is an act which tends to pervert the course of justice (my emphasis). 

45Deane J, at 293 - 294, said:- 

Police inquiries do not, of themselves, constitute ""the course of justice"" for the purposes of the offence of perverting the course of justice. It is necessary, in a case involving alleged conduct to divert or frustrate police inquiries, to identify some actual or potential relationship between the alleged conduct and some pending, probable or possible curial proceedings whose course the accused intended to pervert ... The closeness of that connection may, in some circumstances, found a conclusion that conduct aimed at frustrating or misleading police investigations was directed to perverting the course of justice in pending or possible future court proceedings. Nonetheless, such statements should not be permitted to divert attention from the fact that the offence of conspiring to pervert the course of justice involves conspiring to pervert the course of justice in curial proceedings. Where a conspiracy to mislead or frustrate police inquiries is involved, the offence of conspiring to pervert the course of justice will not be established unless it appears that a purpose of the conspiracy was, by misleading or frustrating the police investigation, to pervert the course of justice in pending or possible curial proceedings (my emphasis). 

46McHugh J also agreed that police investigations were not part of ""the course of justice"" for the purpose of the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice (at 301 and 302). McHugh J stated that, for the purpose of the offence of perverting the course of justice, the course of justice does not commence in criminal proceedings until the laying on an information against, or the arrest of, an accused person (at 303, 304). His Honour added at 304 - 305:- 

Nevertheless, in some circumstances, a false statement made to a police officer in the course of the investigation of an actual, alleged or suspected crime can constitute the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice even though no judicial proceedings have been commenced. As this court said in Murphy , ""an attempt made to pervert the course of justice at a time when no curial proceedings of any kind have been instituted is an offence"". Because the course of justice includes proposed as well as existing judicial proceedings, a false statement made to a police officer will constitute the offence if it had a tendency to pervert the course of judicial proceedings and if it was made with the intention to do so. 

Although a statement made before the commencement of judicial proceedings cannot amount to a contempt of those proceedings, such a statement will be an attempt to pervert the course of justice if the relevant intent and tendency are present. 

47At 307, McHugh J expressed a qualification to the statement he had made:- 

Unless the prosecution proves that the course of justice as a continuing process has been perverted or proves facts which show that an identifiable person has committed an identifiable crime, it is difficult to see how the prosecution can prove that the conduct of the accused interfered with the course of justice... Leaving aside the continuous process cases, proof of the offence will require evidence that the accused has engaged in conduct which prevented or might have prevented the prosecution of a particular offence or that the accused has engaged in conduct which had the tendency to change or did change evidence which would otherwise have been put before a judicial tribunal or which had the tendency to prevent or did prevent evidence from being put before that tribunal. If the evidence does not establish what proceedings would have been commenced or what proceedings were interfered with, the conduct of the accused cannot be shown to have the tendency to pervert the course of justice... It is not enough that the conduct of the accused has misled an investigation into whether a person has committed any offence against the law. 

Did the primary judge fall into error? 

48It is quite clear from the foregoing analysis that the scope of the offence created by section 319 does not differ, in relevant respects, from the scope of the former common law offence. The relevant parameters are those identified in Rogerson's case. This means that the submissions made on behalf of the respondent to Finnane DCJ were incorrect. Importantly, it means that the primary judge, with all respect, was led into error. The Court of Criminal Appeal decision in Einfeld reinforced the proposition that the scope of the offence under section 319, although it had not been enlarged beyond the common law concept, neither had it been diminished. At [89], the Court said:- 

""The administration of the law"" does not readily describe the role of the police in the investigation of crime. Expressions such as the ""enforcement of the law"" or the ""investigation of crime"" would seem more apt if it were Parliament's intention to include within the offence of perverting the course of justice conduct involving the obstruction or perversion of a police investigation, in circumstances in which the offender did not have curial proceedings in contemplation ...(my emphasis) 

49In other words, if the Crown, in the present matter, could establish that the respondent's actions were intended to deflect the police from prosecuting him for the criminal offence that he had allegedly committed, or from adducing evidence of the true facts relating to the alleged offence, the prosecution was clearly capable of being maintained. The fact that no judicial proceedings had been commenced at the time when the respondent spoke to Ms Ullah and Mr Sundarjee, did not preclude the finding of a prima facie case. Nor would it preclude a subsequent determination by a jury that, subject to proof of all the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, that each offence had been committed. Had his Honour quashed the two counts in the indictment, as he indicated he was contemplating doing, there is no doubt that this court would have been entitled to make an order pursuant to section 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act , setting the orders aside. Similarly, had his Honour made an order staying the proceedings, there is no doubt that this court would have been entitled to make an order pursuant to section 5F(2), setting the stay order aside. 

Resolution - second issue: does the court have jurisdiction to intervene? 

50Mr Campbell SC, as I have indicated, argued that since the primary judge did not make any order in the matter, but simply gave a ruling, this court has no jurisdiction to intervene. Regrettably, I have come to the conclusion that this submission must be accepted. It is regrettable because a clear error has been made which cannot be corrected by this court. 

51There is, of course, little doubt that the primary judge thought he had the power to quash the counts in the indictment, and indicated, indeed, that that is the course he might well take. While it might be thought that the practical effect of what his Honour did was to prevent the Crown from proceeding on counts 2 and 3 in the indictment, no order was made to that effect. There is ample authority for the proposition that, in determining the nature of an order that has been made (for the purposes of an examination under section 5F) the court will look to the character and effect of the decision ( R v Cheng [1999] NSWCCA 373; 48 NSWLR 616 at [9] - [14] per Spigelman CJ, Dunford and Kirby JJ agreeing; R v Bozatsis; R v Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303 - 304 per Gleeson CJ; see also Dao v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 per Spigelman CJ at [1] - [6], Allsop P at [74] - [76] and Simpson J at [121] - [126]. Dao reflects the proposition that in an application under section 5F, substance and not mere form should prevail: Cheiko v R [2008] NSWCCA 191; 75 NSWLR 323 at 329 [25]). There can be little doubt that his Honour had in mind refusing to permit the Crown to seek to make a case against the respondent based on his erroneous view of the scope of section 319. However, the fact remains that his Honour did not make such an order and, in my view, it is not appropriate, in the present situation, to infer or conclude by implication that such an order was made. Mr Campbell SC submitted that his Honour's remarks, both in the ruling and during address, to the effect that he regarded the application as one to quash two counts in the indictment were no more than ""ruminations"". They were, in my view, probably more than that, but the fact is that his Honour did not proceed to make an order either quashing the counts in the indictment or staying the proceedings. The fact is that, for the purposes of section 5F, there must be an order to be scrutinised. Here, that was simply not the case. 

52I should also add that what his Honour gave was not a ruling on evidence, nor was it a ruling under or in aid of section 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 . Mr Campbell's submissions in that regard cannot be accepted. The application brought on behalf of the respondent was misconceived in procedural terms. If the proposal were to quash the two counts in the indictment, recourse should have been had to section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 . If a stay were to be obtained, the procedure under section 192A was not appropriate in any sense. 

Conclusion 

53The position that results is this: the primary judge has made a clear and substantial error in relation to the scope of section 319 of the Crimes Act . The evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown at trial was plainly capable of constituting a prima facie case against the respondent in relation to counts 2 and 3 in the indictment. It would be necessary, however, for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt in the trial that, at the time he spoke to the two witnesses, the respondent contemplated the possibility of the commencement of the proceedings against him for the offence that he had allegedly committed. It would be necessary for the Crown to prove that the respondent, being apprehensive of a prosecution for the offence, took the steps he did to prevent that prosecution being brought against him. In that regard, it would be necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that these steps were taken by the respondent with the intent to achieve the result of deflecting the police from prosecuting the offence or from adducing evidence of the true facts in the proceedings. The evidence I have recited was clearly capable of satisfying each of those matters at a prima facie level. 

54However, because the primary judge did not proceed to make any orders in the matter, it is not possible for this court to intervene, and the appeal must be dismissed. That, of course, is not the end of the matter. Because no orders were made by the trial judge, the indictment stands, and is completely unaltered in its terms. Despite his Honour's ""ruling"", there is nothing to stop the prosecution from presenting once again the indictment before his Honour, or for the first time before another judge in the District Court. Were that course to be followed, it would be anticipated that the District Court would take into account the clear observations I have made as to the correct scope of the offence provided for in section 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 . 

55I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

2757009,Director of Public Prosecutions v Hilzinger & Drug Court of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 106,"Judgment 

1GILES JA: I agree with Whealy JA. 

2HODGSON JA: I agree with Whealy JA. 

3WHEALY JA: This is an application brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the name of the Crown, to set aside findings and orders made in the Drug Court of New South Wales on 18 th May and 2 nd June 2010. The critical complaint relates to the finding by his Honour Senior Judge Roger Dive (the primary judge), that Christopher Hilzinger (the first respondent) was an 'eligible person' to be entered into the Drug Court's program. This was the ruling made on 18 th May 2010. The Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW) and its beneficial program is only available, relevantly, to persons who fall within the definition of an ""eligible person"" in section 5 of the Act. The legislation denies eligibility if the person is charged with an offence involving violent conduct. The simple point at issue in this application is whether the first respondent fell into this category so as to be ineligible for Drug Court assistance. 

Grounds of appeal 

4The summons seeks to quash not only the ruling made on 18 th May 2010, but the sentence imposed by his Honour on 2 nd June 2010. It seeks a declaration that the second respondent erred in law in ruling that the first respondent was an eligible person for the purposes of section 5 of the Drug Court Act 1998 . It seeks an order that the matter be remitted to his Honour to be determined according to law. 

5The grounds relied upon assert that his Honour fell into jurisdictional error in determining that the offence pursuant to subsection 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 , with which the first respondent was charged, was not an offence involving violent conduct for the purposes of section 5 of the Drug Court Act 1998 in:- 

(1) Holding that, in making that determination, the court was entitled to have regard only to the elements of the offence with which the first respondent was charged. 

(2) Failing to take into consideration, in making that determination, violent conduct which was connected with the elements of the offence with which the first respondent was charged, and which the court was entitled to take into account when exercising its ordinary sentencing discretion. 

(3) Failing to take into consideration, when making that determination, the damage to property alleged in the offence, pursuant to subsection 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 with which the first respondent was charged. 

The reasons of his Honour Senior Judge Dive 

6The reasons given by his Honour for the finding of eligibility on 18 th May 2010 are before this court. The basic facts are set out by his Honour in paragraphs 1 and 2 of his judgment. I shall set this portion out in full:- 

1. Mr Hilzinger is a 19 year old man who has committed a number of offences, including a serious crime. Unusually for a man referred to the Drug Court, he has never been in trouble before. On 3 rd June 2009, Mr Hilzinger has gone with four other offenders to Lockies Hotel at Leppington in the middle of the night. Wearing balaclavas, the five have gained access to the hotel, confronted and detained Mr Graham, the cleaner, and then caused very significant damage to the hotel by driving both a 4WD and a forklift into the hotel in an attempt to steal a safe and an ATM. A silent alarm was activated, police attended, the offenders fled, and little was actually stolen. Mr Hilzinger was in fact the only person apprehended, as he was found nearby a short time later. Upon apprehension, he had in his possession a balaclava, gloves, and $1390. The money had come from breaking into the cigarette machine. Mr Hilzinger faces no other charges which involve violence towards the cleaner, Mr Graham, even though Mr Graham was kidnapped for a short time (having been taken for a drive at the beginning of this event), manhandled at one point, and then later detained in the staff room. 

2. Mr Hilzinger has remained in custody since his arrest on 3 rd June 2009. When before the Local Court he indicated pleas of guilty, and was committed to the District Court for sentence. Those pleas were maintained when he appeared before Judge Murrell SC at the Campbelltown District Court on 31 st March 2010. After hearing submissions, he was then referred to the Drug Court under s 6 of the Drug Court Act 1998 for the principal offence of ""aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, namely damage property while in the company of four co-offenders"". There are three additional charges to be taken into account on sentence: two matters of being carried in the stolen motor vehicle on the night in question, and the charge of stealing which relates to the cigarettes and money taken from the cigarette machine. 

7The primary judge was faced with a simple argument. He paraphrased it as an argument requiring the court to consider whether eligibility depended upon an ""elements"" or a ""conduct"" test. Did the language of subsection 5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act 1998 require the Drug Court to confine itself to a consideration of whether violent conduct was one of the elements of the offence with which the accused was charged, or did it entitle it to look beyond the elements to any factual circumstance that the Crown might seek to prove, for example on sentence, to suggest that violent conduct had occurred in the commission of the offence? 

8It seems the primary judge had considered this issue in the past, and he drew upon decisions in the Drug Court (including his own) as background to the question that had been asked. Apart from these decisions, his Honour found decisive two decisions of this court which were binding on him. The first was the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Chandler v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] NSWCA 125; 49 NSWLR 1. The second was the decision of the Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions v Ebsworth [2001] NSWCA 318; 124 A Crim R 410. His Honour found that each of these decisions supported the proposition that it was the elements of the charge that were significant, not the particular conduct. Based on these authorities, the primary judge found that there was no element of violent conduct in the charge laid against Mr Hilzinger. Consequently, the first respondent was, in terms of the sub-section, an eligible person. 

9The second argument urged upon the primary judge related to the fact that the Crown might have averred a circumstance of aggravation which alleged violent conduct, even though it had not. Section 105A of the Crimes Act 1900 defined ""circumstances of aggravation"" as ""circumstances involving any one or more"" of six circumstances. The Crown had argued that all six aggravating circumstances set out in section 105A applied to Mr Hilzinger's behaviour, even though only one had been pleaded. Mr Sean Flood of counsel had appeared for the first respondent at the hearing before the primary judge. He argued that the word ""charged"" should be given its normal meaning, and that the identification of which circumstances of aggravation the Crown relied upon was more than simply the identification of a particular. He submitted that the legislation is beneficial legislation and that it should be construed in that way. Finally, Mr Flood had drawn attention to the fact that although a charge of kidnapping had in fact been laid against the first respondent, it was later withdrawn and dismissed. The Crown had conceded that it could not prove that the offender was one of the males who accompanied the victim in his car, or that he was a party to any agreement that the victim would be driven away from the scene. 

10Ms Bloomfield, who then appeared for the Crown, had argued that any one of the available aggravating circumstances could have been averred in the charge, and that all or some of those factors might in due course be relevant and possibly taken into account on sentence. Ms Bloomfield argued that the choice of aggravating circumstances could not be the determining factor on the issue as to Mr Hilzinger's eligibility for a Drug Court program. To this submission, the primary judge responded as follows:- 

""18. I cannot agree with that submission. The fact that there are other, alternate charges available which would have specified those alternate aggravating circumstances does not elevate those alternate aggravating circumstances to be elements of the subject offence. Those facts are, of course, relevant on sentence. But they are not an element of the offence charged, and would not have to be proved at trial. They will be relevant in any sentencing proceedings, including sentencing proceedings before the Drug Court. 

19. The test provided for the Drug Court is to ascertain whether Mr Hilzinger has been charged with an offence involving violent conduct. The test is not whether he could have been charged with an offence involving violent conduct... This is beneficial legislation, it should be interpreted accordingly. It is perhaps obvious that if Parliament had wanted to exclude persons in relation to whom the facts of the case would be of violence to persons or property, it would have been very simple to draft section 5 accordingly. 

20. I remain of the view, as expressed in Bruce , that the words ""charged with an offence involving violent conduct"" should be given their ordinary meaning, and that the clear line of authority is for an elements test. The prosecution has chosen to lay a particular charge, no doubt after considering the evidence available, and a plea of guilty has been entered to that charge. That is the only relevant offence with which he has been charged."" 

11There was one additional matter dealt with by the primary judge. It appears that the Crown, in opposition to Mr Hilzinger's eligibility, had not raised the issue of damage to property. It had, however, been addressed by Mr Flood in his written submissions. In that circumstance, the primary judge gave his view on the matter, although strictly speaking he was not required to do so. In the instant case, there had been very considerable damage to property amounting to some $63,474. As to this, his Honour said:- 

The fact that very substantial damage was done to the property does not render Mr Hilzinger ineligible. Breaking into premises was a crime anticipated by the legislators, and is specifically mentioned in the Second Reading Speech frequently referred to in the cases on section 5. So crimes involving damage to property were expected to be eligible offences. Unfortunately, it is the case that very considerable damage is sometimes occasioned to premises during break-ins. Very expensive shopfront windows or secure roller doors may be broken, or there may be extensive vandalism. It can also be, Mr Flood has pointed out, that great damage may be occasioned with no element of violence at all - with aerosol paint, for example. The fact that very significant material damage was done, as apart from (just) breaking a door or window to gain entry, does not elevate the offence to one which is an ineligible offence. 

12In all these circumstances his Honour confirmed his view that the second respondent was properly considered to be an eligible person for the purposes of section 5 of the Drug Court Act 1998 . Later, on 2 nd June 2010, the primary judge imposed a total sentence of 4 years imprisonment, the sentence being suspended upon the first respondent's entry into a drug program. 

The Drug Court Act 1998 

13I shall now briefly mention the relevant portions of the Drug Court Act 1998 . The objects of the Act are stated in section 3, as follows:- 

(a) to reduce the drug dependency of eligible persons and eligible convicted offenders, and 

(b) to promote the re-integration of such drug dependent persons into the community, and 

(c) to reduce the need for such drug dependent persons to resort to criminal activity to support their drug dependencies. 

14The Act is to achieve its objects in relation to eligible persons by establishing a scheme under which drug dependent persons charged with criminal offences can be diverted into programs designed to eliminate, or at least reduce, their dependency on drugs (section 3(2)). The definition of an 'eligible person' appears in section 5, as follows:- 

(1) A person is an eligible person if: 

(a) the person is charged with an offence, other than an offence referred to in subsection (2), and 

(b) the facts alleged in connection with the offence, together with the person's antecedents and any other information available to the court, indicate that it is highly likely that the person will, if convicted, be required to serve a sentence of full-time imprisonment, and 

(c) the person has pleaded guilty to, or indicated that he or she intends to plead guilty to, the offence, and 

(d) the person appears to be dependent on the use of prohibited drugs (within the meaning of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 ) or other drugs prescribed by the regulations, and 

(e) the person satisfies such other criteria as are prescribed by the regulations. 


15Subsection (2) provides that: 

(2) A person is not an eligible person if the person is charged with: 

(a) an offence punishable under Division 2 of Part 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 , not being an offence that (under Chapter 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 ) is capable of being dealt with summarily, or 

(b) an offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault, or 

(c) any other offence of a kind prescribed by the regulations. 


16Section 6 enables a court before which a person is charged with an offence or to which a person appeals against a sentence imposed by some other court, to ascertain whether the person ""appears to be an eligible person"". The section enables the court, in the circumstances there mentioned, to refer the person to the Drug Court to be dealt with for the offence. Clause 4 of the Drug Court Regulation 2010 (which commenced on 1 September 2010, replacing the previous clause 4 of the now repealed Drug Court Regulation 2005 ) also mandates further conditions of eligibility, namely the offender must reside in a particular local government area, must not be suffering from any mental condition that could prevent or restrict the person's active participation in a program, be over the age of 18 years, and any criminal proceedings against the person for the relevant offence must not be within the jurisdiction of the Children's Court. Section 7A of the Act empowers the Drug Court to determine whether it will accept a person into the Drug Court program in relation to an offence. The Drug Court must be satisfied, for example, that the person is an eligible person, that he or she has pleaded guilty to the offence, and that, having regard to the person's antecedents, it is appropriate for the person to participate in a program under the Act. The Drug Court must also be satisfied that there are appropriate facilities to supervise and control the person's participation in a program, and that the person accepts the conditions to be imposed for the purpose of the program. Upon satisfaction of these and other matters, the court is then required to convict and sentence the person in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , but must suspend the execution of the sentence for the duration of the person's program and impose conditions. The orders thus made will incorporate a number of conditions relating to supervision and behaviour. These may include sanctions for non-compliance with the program and rewards for satisfactory compliance. The conditions may be varied throughout the implementation of the program. Sections 10 and 11 contain provisions for the termination of a program imposed on a person. Section 12 enables the court, upon termination of the program, to reconsider the offender's initial sentence and to determine the final sentence to be imposed. It cannot be greater than the initial sentence. 

Submissions of the Crown 

17Mr David Arnott SC of counsel appeared for the Crown. Counsel noted, in his written submissions, that the first respondent had in fact been charged with, and pleaded guilty to, two counts of knowingly being carried in a stolen conveyance (contrary to section 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 ) and one count of larceny (section 117 of the Crimes Act 1900 ). Counsel conceded, however, that, for the purposes of this application, it was only necessary to consider the principal charge under subsection 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 - aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. The indictable offence and its circumstance of aggravation, as pleaded, was damage to property while in the company of four offenders. Counsel then recited in detail the history of the matter as I have briefly set out earlier. Counsel, in his written submissions, suggested that two questions arose for determination:- 

First, where a court takes violent conduct into account on sentence for the offence charged, should that violent conduct be taken into account when determining the threshold question of whether that person is eligible to enter the drug court program? Secondly, are there offences where the wording provides inadequate guidance as to whether the offence could be considered violent conduct? And, if so, can the conduct of the offender be considered in such a case? 

18Counsel accepted that the decision of this court in Chandler v DPP appeared to stand in his way. He acknowledge that in that case, Hodgson CJ in Eq (with whom Stein JA agreed) stated at [37]:- 

...the use of the word ""charged"" in s5(2) points very strongly in the other direction, that is, suggests very strongly that it is the elements of the charge which are significant, not the particular conduct. That view was expressed in an earlier decision of Judge Murrell in R v Ranse (1999) NSWDRGC 2; and I agree with that decision. 

19Similarly, counsel acknowledged that the construction of the legislation favoured in Chandler v DPP had been followed in DPP v Ebsworth. In that case, the offender had been charged with the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a baseball bat. The offender was found to be ineligible under section 5(2) of the Act by the simple process of confining attention to the criminal pleading, as distinct from the facts. In that case, Mr Arnott acknowledged, Mason ACJ had said, at [1]:- 

... a necessary element of the offence of the robbery charged will be proof of the use or threat of violence. 

20Counsel's first argument suggested, however, that neither Chandler nor Ebsworth had directly dealt with the scope of the meaning of the word ""involving"" in the phrase ""an offence involving violent conduct"", found in section 5. Moreover, he argued that neither decision had dealt directly with the issue that he maintained arose for determination in the present matter. 

21Secondly, counsel submitted that the phrase ""an offence involving violent conduct"" gave rise to a broader meaning than simply the elements of the charge, ""on the face of the record"". The distinction sought to be drawn by Mr Arnott might most clearly be seen in paragraph [20] of his submissions, where he said:- 

However, section 5 of the Act does not speak about a ""charged offence"" of ""violence"" but rather a ""charged offence"" involving ""violent conduct"". That, it is submitted, includes an offence one of the essential ingredients of which is violence, or something less than an offence of or intrinsically involving violence. As will be seen by a review of the cases below, there is a consistent line of authority supporting the proposition that at least this latter category should include the situation where, to quote the Chief Justice of Tasmania in a case to which reference will be made, ""the violence relied upon is so connected to one of the ingredients of the crime that the court would be entitled to take into account when exercising its ordinary sentencing discretion without violating the principle referred to in R v De Simone [sic] (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

22Thirdly, counsel relied upon relevant Dictionary meanings. The Oxford English Dictionary, 2 nd edition, defined ""involve"" relevantly as: ""to enfold, envelop, entangle, include"". The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defined ""involved"" as: ""to include, to contain, imply"". 

23The applicant then placed reliance upon a variety of decisions, generally arising in different statutory contexts and in other jurisdictions, to support his argument on the first issue he had identified. Perhaps principal among these was the decision to which I have earlier made reference, namely that of R v McCrossen [1991] TAS R 1. In that case, Green CJ had to decide whether the offender had been ""convicted of a crime involving an element of violence"", pursuant to subsection 392(1)(a) of the Tasmanian Criminal Code . This section enabled a sentencing judge to declare the offender a dangerous criminal if certain conditions were met, including, under subsection (1)(a), where the person ""is convicted of a crime involving an element of violence"". The Chief Justice stated:- 

I agree with respect with the view expressed by Wright J in R v Gill ... that in order to satisfy the requirements of section 392(1)(a) the ""element of violence"" involved need not be an essential ingredient of the crime. This section provides that the crime of which the accused is convicted must be a crime ""involving"" an element of violence. The word ""involving"" is not equivalent of ""one of the essential ingredients which is"" and there is no reason not to give the word its ordinary meaning. However, if the element of violence relied upon is not an essential ingredient of the particular form of the crime with which the accused is charged, I think that the crime can only be regarded as ""involving an element of violence"" if the violence relied upon is so connected with one of the ingredients of the crime that the court would be entitled to take it into account when exercising its ordinary sentencing discretion without violating the principle referred to in R v De Simoni ...that a judge may not take into account aggravating circumstances if the effect of his doing so is that the accused is sentenced for a crime other than that of which he has been convicted. 


24Reference was also made to Breeze v R [1999] QCA 303; 106 A Crim R 441, where the Queensland Court of Appeal considered legislation specifying that a sentence of imprisonment should only be imposed as a last resort, and that a sentence that allows the offender to stay in the community is preferable. This beneficial provision was excluded, however, where the offence ""involved the use of... violence against another person"". The trial judge had found that it did (a female shop assistant had been threatened by three males with raised screwdrivers or iron bars, and told to open the till). The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal. 

25Counsel submitted that the cases reviewed (including those that I have specifically mentioned) established that the notion that a person is charged with an offence involving violent conduct is something less than an offence of violence, or an offence in which one of the essential ingredients is violence, even though nobody was physically harmed. 

26The second question identified by the applicant in its written submissions assumed the correctness of the ""elements test"", but posed the question whether the conduct of the offender could be considered in the circumstances where the wording of the offence provided inadequate guidance as to whether the offence could be considered as violent conduct. Counsel submitted that an offence that has, as an element, the damaging of property, may or not be an offence of violence, depending on the facts of the case. He submitted that there was no reason why crimes involving damage to property should not involve ""on occasions, violent conduct"". He further submitted that there was no justification in confining the word ""violent conduct"" to the person. In the present matter, it was argued that the damage caused by kicking in doors and driving two vehicles into the hotel, in what has become known as a ""ram raid"", plainly involved violent conduct. 

Submissions for the respondent 

27Ms Robyn Burgess of counsel appeared for the first respondent. Ms Burgess submitted that the cases of Chandler and Ebsworth authoritatively decided the questions in this matter. Ms Burgess submitted that Chandler and Ebsworth are clear authority that, when considering whether a person is charged with ""an offence involving violent conduct"" for the purposes of section 5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act , it is the elements of the offence charged which provides the relevant consideration, and not the surrounding circumstances as disclosed in the facts. In relation to the second question, counsel submitted that damaging property is not an offence involving violent conduct for the purposes of section 5(2)(b) of the Act, and the extent of any damage caused is not relevant to that question. So far as the decision in Ebsworth is concerned, Ms Burgess observed that the applicant now seeks to argue the opposite position to that which it had argued in 2001. 

28Ms Burgess submitted that no basis had been demonstrated for suggesting that the two earlier decisions Chandler and Ebsworth should now be regarded as clearly wrong. Ms Burgess further submitted that the additional cases relied upon by the applicant were simply decisions containing obiter observations, generally in other jurisdictions, and arising in different statutory contexts. It was submitted that they provided little assistance in the present matter. 

29Finally, Ms Burgess submitted that the statutory purpose of the Drug Court Act , and the policy behind it, is clearly set out in section 3. It is beneficial legislation, and the object of the Act is to be achieved by diverting eligible persons to drug offender programs so as to eliminate or reduce their dependency, and consequently reduce their need to resort to criminal activity. Section 5(2)(b) provided mandatory exclusion from the Drug Court and, for that reason, it should be construed strictly, and confined, as the authorities suggest, to the elements of the offence charged. The language of the legislation, and the purposes of the Drug Court Act , supports this construction. The test, which looks at the conduct of the offender rather than the elements of the offence, would, if imposed, result in uncertainty, lengthy hearings and confusion in determining whether the facts, in an individual case, were capable of establishing that an offence involved violent conduct. Ultimately, the burden falls on the prosecution to elect the charge, if it wishes to do so, which appropriately reflects elements of the violence. It also reflects the aggravating circumstance to be included in the indictment. Where the offence elected does not require proof of violent conduct to the person, the Crown should be held to its choice. 

Resolution 

30The applicant's first argument, based on Grounds 1 and 2 in the Summons, cannot succeed. It falls at the first hurdle. In my view, the decisions in Chandler and Ebsworth are fairly and squarely against the principal proposition advanced by Mr Arnott. 

31In Chandler , the unsuccessful claimant had been charged with two offences. The first was driving a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact occasioning death. The second was driving a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm. The claimant had been driving a stolen motor vehicle on the Hume Highway, and was travelling at an excessive speed and changing lanes aggressively. His vehicle collided with another vehicle, and became airborne. It landed on the roof on an oncoming vehicle, before coming to rest upside down on the highway. The driver of the other vehicle died, and her passenger suffered brain injury. Hence the two charges. 

32The Drug Court had to consider the eligibility of the claimant for the purposes of admission to the Drug Court program. Her Honour Judge Murrell determined that the claimant was ineligible on the basis that each of the offences with which he had been charged was ""an offence involving violent conduct"". 

33The Court of Appeal was invited to find that her Honour's decision was in error. At [32] - [33], Hodgson CJ in Eq (as he then was) said:- 

The sole question argued before us was whether or not Judge Murrell was correct in her determination as to s5(2)(b). There was no dispute that, if we think her Honour was wrong on this point, we should grant relief substantially as sought: cf Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163; Waterhouse v Gilmour (1988) 12 NSWLR 270 at 276; Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 at 418. 

The question before us involves consideration of two matters. First, does the application of s5(2)(b) depend upon the elements of the offence with which the person is charged, or the circumstances of the particular offence actually committed by that person; and secondly, what is the nature of the violent conduct referred to, and is intent or recklessness as to violence required? 

His Honour then continued:- 

Elements or circumstances? 

34. On the first question, it was submitted by Mr Smith for the Director of Public Prosecutions that one could take account both of the essential elements of the offence and of the conduct of the person on the particular occasion. 

35. This has some support from the Second Reading Speech (Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 27 th October 1998 at 9030), which included the following statement (at 9031): 

""The Drug Court program will deal only with offenders who commit certain categories of offences. These offences will be mainly non-violent theft offences. Those offenders who commit sexual offences and offences involving violent conduct will not be eligible. The types of offences that will be included are break, enter and steal, fraud and forgery offences, offences involving stealing from a person or unarmed robberies, provided there is no violence. Possession and use of prohibited drugs, or dealing in quantities of prohibited drugs below the indictable limit."" 

36. The reference in that speech to committing of offences, and the phrase ""provided there is no violence"", suggests that the actual conduct of the person in relation to the offence is relevant. 

37. However, in my opinion, the use of the word ""charged"" in s5(2) points very strongly in the other direction, that is, suggests very strongly that it is the elements of the charge which are significant, not the particular conduct. That view was expressed in an earlier decision of Judge Murrell in R v Ranse (1999) NSWDRGC 2; and I agree with that decision. 

34In relation to the second issue before the court, Hodgson CJ in Eq concluded that the section 52A offences with which the claimant had been charged, were in fact offences involving violent conduct, within section 5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act . In the course of that discussion, his Honour accepted that, as the Drug Court Act 1998 had, as one of its objects, the provision of benefits to offenders, it should be construed quite strictly. This was so because it removed the benefit which would otherwise accrue to an offender. 

35Stein JA stated that he had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Hodgson CJ in Eq, and agreed with it and the orders he had proposed. Stein JA agreed that offences against section 52A of the Crimes Act were offences involving ""violent conduct"". 

36The third member of the court was Powell JA. His Honour did not agree that the elements of the offence with which the claimant had been charged included violent conduct. In that circumstance, Powell JA indicated that he would have found error in Judge Murrell's conclusion. On the first issue, however, it is clear from a reading of Powell JA's decision that he agreed with Hodgson CJ in Eq that the proper construction of section 5(2)(b) required that it is the elements of the offence charged, rather than the actual conduct, which is the determining factor in relation to eligibility. 

37In DPP v Ebsworth , the offender had been charged with robbery of a wine shop ""whilst armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a baseball bat"". The Drug Court had held, on the basis that the offender had not used the baseball bat in the robbery other than by way of threat, that, for this reason, his behaviour did not render him ""ineligible"" within the meaning of section 5(2)(b). 

38The claimant sought a declaration that his Honour Acting Judge Barnett had erred in finding that the offence charged under 97(1) of the Crimes Act against the offender was not an offence involving violent conduct within section 5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act . 

39Meagher JA at [15] - [20] said:- 

15. The issue before his Honour and on appeal is whether the offence under s97(1) of the Crimes Act that the first opponent has been charged with, constitutes an offence involving violent conduct as provided in s5(2)(b). ""Violent conduct"" is not defined in the Act, nor is the word, ""violent"". 

16. In determining whether it was or was not, his Honour considered one must look at the facts of each particular case. His Honour set out his findings in relation to the conduct of the first opponent as follows: 

""Now there is no suggestion anywhere that the applicant actually used the baseball bat. The victim Matthew Fowler said in para 9: 'the first guy who was carrying the baseball bat held it in his right hand at about chest level, I was worried that he was going to use the bat. I felt threatened by this.' So that conduct certainly makes the matter a serious matter falling within s97, of course. It is a threat."" 

17. His Honour concluded, on the basis of other cases decided in the Drug Court in relation to threats, that such behaviour does not render a person ineligible within the meaning of s5(2)(b); see R v Sloane [1999] NSWDRGC 3. 

18. The claimant submitted that the correct test to determine whether the offence should be described as one involving violent conduct was not that undertaken by his Honour below of looking at the actual facts, but rather that involved in this Court in Chandler v DPP (2000) 113 A Crim R 196, where the learned Chief Judge in Equity with whom Mr Justice Stein agreed, stated: 

""The use of the word, 'charged', in s5(2) suggests very strongly that it is the elements of the charge which are significant, not the particular conduct. That view was expressed in the earlier decision of Judge Murrell in R v Ranse (1999) NSWDRGC 2; and I agree with that decision."" 

19. I agree with that construction of the section. In my view, this Court should follow what was said in Chandler in this connection. 

20. In the present case, if one looks at the charge, it is implicit as I have said from the verb, to rob, and the accusation of an offensive weapon, that violence was necessarily involved. Those two elements together constitute violent conduct. 


40Accordingly, Meagher JA was of the view that the charge of armed robbery armed with an offensive weapon, in reference to the elements of the charge, constituted behaviour involving violent conduct. 

41Mason P said:- 

1. If one confines oneself to the criminal pleading as distinct from the facts the Crown expects to prove in this case, this was in my view ""an offence involving violent conduct"", with the consequence that the person charged was not an eligible person within s5 of the Drug Court Act 1998. That is because a necessary element of the offence of the robbery charged will be proof of the use or threat of violence. 

2. The judgment below turns upon a distinction between the use of violence and the threat of violence as the means of putting the victim in fear. In my view that is a distinction without difference in the present context. In either case, ""violent conduct"" is involved in the offence charged (see Chandler v DPP (2000) 49 NSWLR 1 at 4, per Powell JA.) The Act does not refer to violent conduct giving rise to physical injury. 

3. s5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act, states that a person is not an eligible person if the person is charged with ""an offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault"". Language of such generality does not, in my view, support the distinction urged upon us by counsel for Mr Ebsworth in her able submissions, namely a distinction between an assault based on a threat of violence and a battery, however slight. 

4. For those reasons, I am of the view that it was not open in law for Barnett ADCJ to be satisfied that the first opponent was an eligible person. 

5. I agree with the reasons of Meagher JA and with the orders that he proposes. 

42Sheller JA agreed with the other members of the court. 

43These decisions emphatically require the rejection of the arguments based on Grounds 1 and 2 in the Summons. This court will not lightly depart from its previous decisions and will do so only when compelled to the conclusion that the earlier decision was wrong: Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504 at [273] and following; Tzaidas (BHT Tzaidas) v Child & Ors [2004] NSWCA 252; 61 NSWLR 18 at [29] - [35] per Giles JA; Fobco Pty Ltd v Harvey (1996) 40 NSWLR 454 at 462 per Beazley JA; Nguyen v Nguyen (1990) 169 CLR 245 at 269 per Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ. Mr Arnott did not seek leave to query the correctness of the earlier decisions. Rather he endeavoured to side-step their effect by posing the first question in the way he did. This, it will be recalled, was the suggestion that, when the Drug Court comes to sentence an offender, it may, in some way, revisit its earlier finding if it finds that the circumstances of the offence include conduct that could be described as violent. Alternatively, in his oral submissions, Mr Arnott suggested that the Drug Court might, in anticipation of sentence, examine the facts sheet or Agreed Statement of Facts (if there were one) and draw on these facts on the eligibility question. 

44As I have said, Chandler and Ebsworth really supply the answer to this submission. However, in deference to Mr Arnott's argument, it should be noted that the general context of the relevant statutory provisions concerning eligibility do not support the argument in any event. 

45In my opinion, Mr Arnott's argument does not sufficiently take account of the sequence of steps that are required to be taken under the legislation. First, the judge before whom the offender is charged is to ascertain whether ""the person appears to be an eligible person"" (section 6(2)(a)) and, if so, to ascertain ""whether the person is willing to be referred to the drug court to be dealt with for the offence"" (section 6(2)(b)). In the present case, the judge who made those decisions and referred the matter to the Drug Court (section 6(2)(c)) was Judge Murrell. The test is an undemanding one and there has been no challenge raised as to her Honour's determination which occurred at Campbelltown Court on 31 st March 2010. 

46The second step required under the legislation arises from the terms of section 7A. Where a person, having been referred under section 6, comes before the Drug Court, it is the duty of the Drug Court to address the questions raised under section 7A(2). The court cannot proceed to sentence before those issues have been addressed. The court must be satisfied as to each of the matters stipulated in the section before deciding whether it will ""deal with the offender in relation to the offence under the section"". 

It is important to note however, that s7A gives the court a discretion as to whether it will include a person in the drug program. Section 7A(2) states:- 

(2) The Drug Court may deal with a person under this section in relation to an offence if, and only if, it is satisfied as to each of the following matters (emphasis added): 

(a) that the person is an eligible person, 

(b) that the person has pleaded guilty to the offence (whether before the referring court or the Drug Court) and has been found guilty of the offence, 

(c) that, having regard to the person's antecedents, it would be appropriate for the person to participate in a program under this Act, 

(d) that facilities to supervise and control the person's participation in such a program are available, and have been allocated to the person, in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the regulations, 

(e) that the person accepts the conditions imposed by this Act and the conditions that the Drug Court proposes to impose on the person (whether immediately or at some later date) as a consequence of his or her conviction and sentence under this section, 

(f) that the person has been informed of the Drug Court's powers under Division 2 and of the respective consequences, as regards the sentence to be imposed under section 12, of the person's compliance or non-compliance with a program, 

(g) that any person (an affected person ) with whom it is likely the person would reside during the period of the person's participation in a program under this Act has consented in writing to the person residing with the affected person during that period. 


Section 7A(10) is also important in this regard. It is in these terms: 

(10) Nothing in this Act entitles a person to be convicted and sentenced under this section, and no appeal lies against any decision by the Drug Court not to convict or sentence a person under this section. 

47The third step demanded by the legislation arises when, and only when, the court is satisfied as to the section 7A(2) matters. It may then, in its discretion, ""deal with the person"" in relation to the offence. If it determines to do so, it must convict and sentence the person in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . The court is then obliged, as part of the statutory sequence, to make an order imposing the conditions that the person has accepted under section 7A(2)(e), and is further obliged to make an order suspending execution of the sentence for the duration of the person's drug program. As a practical matter, although not a specific requirement of the statute, it is often the case that a potential candidate for the program will have undergone a detoxification process before admittance. A program is then drawn up for the benefit of the particular offender that is recognised in the conditions imposed by the court. 

48It should be noted that where a person has failed to satisfy the Drug Court of the conditions in section 7A, including eligibility, the Drug Court may nevertheless sentence the person if it is satisfied of the matters in section 7D(2). One of those matters is the consent of the person to be dealt with by the Drug Court. If an eligible offender does not consent to the Drug Court dealing with the matter under this section, (or in such other circumstances as the Drug Court may determine), the Drug Court is required to remit the offender back to the referring court. 

49The fourth stage of the sequence involves the making of orders imposing either rewards or sanctions as the person makes, or does not make, his or her way through the program that has been established by the court (section 16(1) and (2)). 

50The final sequence is the termination of the program, either in accordance with section 10 or section 11. In the former case, for example, the program may be terminated where the Drug Court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the offender is unlikely to make any further progress in the program, or that his or her further participation in the program poses an unacceptable risk to the community that the person may re-offend. By way of contrast, a section 11 termination occurs where the Drug Court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the drug offender has substantially complied with the program. Upon termination, the Drug Court undertakes the final step required under the legislation, namely a reconsideration of the drug offender's initial sentence. Once a person has been admitted to the program (""dealt with under section 7A""), he remains within it until termination and the imposition of final sentence. 

51This sequence presents itself as a rational process from referral/eligibility findings though to termination and final sentence. Once a person has been placed in the program, it would not be expected ordinarily that the program would be interrupted because of the need to revisit ineligibility. This lends support to the proposition that eligibility was not intended to be facts-based. 

52There is every reason to suppose that the legislature had in mind that a constant and certain test would be set for eligibility. The elements of the offence test meet that criterion. The facts test would be far less certain. It would have the capacity to interrupt the sequential nature of the Drug Court program and, to that extent, disturb the beneficial flow of treatment and counselling for addiction. The legislature does not appear to have had in contemplation, in the normal case, a revisiting of eligibility at the sentencing or later stages, enabling a reversal of the original finding, based on some circumstance of behaviour not necessary for the establishment of the elements of the offence. 

53Of course, as I have noted, the court does have a discretion as to whether it will deal with a person for an offence in the manner required by section 7A. The ambit or context of the discretion is not stated expressly or otherwise in section 7A(10), or elsewhere in the Act. I shall return to this point later. 

The offence under section 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 

54There is no doubt that the principal offence charged against the first respondent did not allege or require proof beyond reasonable doubt of violent conduct against any person as an element of the offence. 

55I have earlier mentioned that the first respondent was charged with an offence of aggravated break and enter, and commit serious indictable offence, namely damage to property. The circumstance of aggravation was that he was in the company of four other offenders. 

56The elements of the offence under section 112(2) were:- 

(1) That the first respondent broke and entered the hotel at Leppington; 
(2) He committed a serious indictable offence therein. 

57A ""serious indictable offence"" is defined in section 4 of the Crimes Act 1900 as ""an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more"". Section 195 of the Crimes Act 1900 appears in Subdivision 2 of Part 4, which relates to crimes against property generally. Section 195 provides:- 

(1) A person who intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable: 

(a) to imprisonment for 5 years. 

The elements of this offence are as stated in the section. They do not include any element requiring proof of violent conduct towards a person. 


58Section 112 of the Crimes Act 1900 appears in Subdivision 4, which deals (inter alia) with housebreaking. Circumstances of aggravation are defined in section 105A(1) as follows: 

circumstances of aggravation means circumstances involving any one or more of the following: 

(a) the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument, 

(b) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, 

(c) the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person, 

(d) the alleged offender intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on any person, 

(e) the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty, 

(f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed. 

59As I have said, in the present matter, the first respondent was charged with a circumstance of aggravation, namely being in the company of other persons. It can be seen from this analysis that the principal charge against the first respondent, as pleaded, was made up of essential elements, none of which required proof of violent conduct towards a person. It was essentially for this reason that the primary judge considered that the first respondent was not excluded from eligibility. As his Honour said, the test is not whether he could have been charged with an offence involving violent conduct, but whether the offence with which the offender was charged was an offence involving violent conduct. 

60Mr Arnott argued (as Ms Broomfield had done before the primary judge) that a number of the aggravating circumstances provided for in section 105A of the Crimes Act were available to be proved against the first respondent at the time he came to be sentenced, notwithstanding that they were not pleaded in the indictment. For example, when the first respondent and his co-offenders gained entry to the premises by ""busting"" a roller door open, he had been carrying a stick about 50 centimetres long and an inch thick. He had been told to take the stick in the event that the cleaner, who was working in the hotel, tried to retaliate. The cleaner was confronted by all the men and told to get down on his knees. Later the cleaner was put in the staff room and told to stay there while the offenders engaged in what was effectively a ""ram-raid"" operation, in an endeavour to dislodge and move the automatic teller machine in the hotel. Not surprisingly, the cleaner, although not physically harmed, was deeply disturbed by the events of 3 rd June 2009. 

61Mr Arnott's point was that any of the additional aggravating circumstances (beyond the circumstance pleaded), subject to proof beyond reasonable doubt, could be relied on by the Crown for the purpose of the sentencing exercise. In Regina v Kenny Li (Unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 9 th July 1997, Abadee and Studdert JJ) a two-person bench had held that Howie DCJ (as he then was) had been entitled to take into account circumstances of aggravation beyond those raised in the indictment, provided they did not ""warrant a conviction for a more serious offence"" (this was a reference to the De Simoni principle). This decision has been followed and approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in a number of cases since: Marshall v R [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [10]; R v AD [2005] NSWCCA 208 at [22]. 

62Mr Arnott argued that, as a consequence, the Drug Court was entitled to have regard to the Agreed Statement of Facts, and to ascertain whether circumstances of aggravation that might be sustained (beyond that pleaded in the indictment) revealed violent conduct to the person. If so, counsel argued, the Drug Court should have found the first respondent ineligible. 

63In my opinion, the primary judge was entitled to reject this argument in the manner he did. Strictly speaking, on the issue of eligibility, the matter had to be determined on the basis of the ""offence charged"" in the indictment. Chandler and Ebsworth required the Drug Court to examine the elements of the offence charged against Mr Hilzinger. If there were no element of violent conduct in that charge as pleaded, he was entitled to be found to be an eligible person. As the primary judge stated, the test provided is to ascertain whether an offender has been charged with an offence involving violent conduct. The test is not whether he could have been charged with an offence involving violent conduct. Nor, might I add, is the test one that requires the Drug Court to determine, when it comes to the imposition of sentence, whether there may have been some violent conduct involved in the facts relating to the commission of the offence. The prosecution had made an election to lay a particular charge alleging one circumstance of aggravation, which did not involve violent conduct. It was to that charge that the first respondent pleaded guilty. It was open to the prosecution to choose an alternate aggravating circumstance if it had wished to do so. Eligibility fell to be determined by a careful consideration of the actual charge laid against the first respondent, and not one that might have been brought against him. 

64I have earlier stated that the Drug Court had a discretion as to whether it should admit an eligible person to the drug program. This discretion was described by the Minister in the Second Reading Speech as ""an unfettered discretion whether to accept persons into the program"" (NSW Parliamentary Debates, 27 October 1998, p 9032). The language of section 7A, and in particular, section 7A(10), confirms the existence of this discretion, and that no appeal lies against a decision not to accept a person who might otherwise be eligible. 

65As to whether the discretion is properly described as ""unfettered"", I would, for myself, prefer to say that the language of section 7A (including subsection 10), confers a discretion whose ambit is to be inferred from the scope and purpose of the legislation ( Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning (1947) 74 CLR 492 at 504 - 505; K-Generation Pty Ltd v Liquor Licensing Court (2009) 237 CLR 501 at [59] per French J). It is, of course, a discretion that must be exercised in good faith. It could not, however, be suggested that a person who is ineligible could nonetheless be admitted to the Drug Court program. The discretion is plainly not unfettered in that sense. The objects of the legislation are clearly set out in section 3. The means by which those laudable objects are to be achieved include the suspension of a custodial sentence, otherwise appropriate as punishment, during the currency of a program designed to eliminate an offender's dependency on drugs, thereby eliminating that person's need to resort to criminal activity to support the dependency. Thus, the elimination of drug dependency, and the restoration of a person to his or her function as a law-abiding citizen, in the case of non-violent offences, is intended to trump the imposition and execution of an otherwise appropriate custodial sentence. Upon completion of a successful program, a participant may not be required to undergo custody at all. 

66With these observations in mind, it will be apparent that it would be open to the Drug Court, notwithstanding that an offender is eligible for admission to its program, to decline to so accept the offender because of the seriousness of the offence, or because of the presence of violent conduct of an extreme kind, not otherwise inherent in the elements of the offence charged. Such an exercise of discretion, based on that consideration alone, it might be thought, is likely to be a rare occurrence. This particular consideration - the seriousness of the offence - would obviously need to be considered alongside a range of other circumstances, including those that are both benevolent and beneficial to the offender. But the discretion is certainly there, and available in those rare situations where the need for strict punishment in accordance with the application of proper sentencing principles, of itself, outweighed the desirability of suspending punishment, so as to divert an offender into a program to reduce or eliminate drug dependency. 

67I hasten to add that the exercise of such a discretion was not urged upon the primary judge in the present matter. Nor did the primary judge entertain, admit or exclude the existence of such a discretion in his decision. His determination was concerned with the strict question of eligibility. It could not be said that any error of law appears on the face of his reasons in relation to the existence or exercise of a residual discretion as to whether to admit the first respondent to the program. In any event, there were plainly ample reasons why the first respondent should have been admitted to the Drug Court program. While it is true that the offence charged had, in the enumeration of its circumstances, some very serious overtones, it was also the fact that the Crown accepted that it could not be demonstrated that he had any involvement in the kidnapping of the cleaner. In the Agreed Statement of Facts, he was seen to be on the fringe of the joint criminal enterprise that eventuated, to take the ATM from the Leppington Hotel. The first respondent had never been to the location before, he was prevailed upon by others, shortly before the offence, to act as a look-out and then, in the end, joined the others when the premises were broken into. When he was apprehended by police, he immediately participated in an electronically recorded interview, during which he made admissions as to his involvement in the offence. He pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and, as the primary judge noted, unusually, he had no criminal antecedents whatsoever. He was clearly a suitable person to be included in a program. The factors I have mentioned, bearing in mind the objects of the legislation, more than outweighed, in the offender's case, the serious nature of, and the extensive damage caused by, the ram-raid crime. 

68The final argument advanced by Mr Arnott in relation to the first two grounds of appeal was based upon his analysis of a number of authorities dealing with the word ""involving"". It will be recalled that counsel's argument was that too little attention had been paid to this word. There were authorities (admittedly dealing with different statutory contexts) where a distinction had been drawn between ""an offence of violence"" and ""an offence involving violence"". In my opinion, however, this argument could not succeed because, once again, the basis of the argument had been effectively rebutted in Chandler and Ebsworth . As I indicated earlier, the Court of Appeal had placed particular reliance on the use of the word ""charged"" in section 5(2), finding that it is the elements of the charge that are significant, not the particular conduct. For present purposes, it might be said that the cases dealing with different statutory contexts, where the phrase ""offences involving violent conduct"" is used, are by no means to be equated with the precise language of section 5(2) and the general context of the Drug Court Act . The language of the section requires the Drug Court to examine whether the offender has been charged with an offence involving violent conduct (or sexual assault), a context rather different from that mentioned in the authorities referred to in the written submissions. 

69The distinction can be readily seen when regard is had to the case of McCrossen, sought to be relied on by Mr Arnott. In that case, the accused had pleaded guilty to attempting to commit the crime of threatening to murder, contrary to provisions in the Criminal Code . At the sentencing hearing, the Crown asked the court to declare the offender a dangerous criminal. Section 392 of the Criminal Code allowed the court to make such a declaration where a person ""is convicted of a crime involving an element of violence"". The declaration is made where the sentencing court is of the opinion ""that such a declaration is warranted for the protection of the public"". It can be easily seen that, in the context of this particular provision of the Criminal Code , it would be necessary for the court to examine all of the circumstances involved in the crime, so as to reach a conclusion that a declaration would be warranted. Green CJ applied the meaning which the common law gave to the word ""violence"" and held that, for the purposes of section 392(1)(a) of the Criminal Code , the making of a threat to kill, with the intention of intimidating someone, was capable of constituting a crime involving an element of violence. 

70Reference may be made to two further decisions mentioned by Mr Arnott in his submissions. In Breeze , the Queensland Court of Appeal, as I have said earlier, refused leave to appeal to the offender. He had sought leave to appeal from the imposition of a custodial sentence for robbery in company whilst armed. In the course of the robbery, violence had been threatened against the victim, without physical force being applied. The applicant's complaint was that the sentencing judge had relied partly on section 9(3)(a) of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 (Qld) which, in effect, when violence was involved, disentitled the offender to a benefit, such as imprisonment being imposed ""only as a last resort"". The particular legislation excluded this beneficial aspect of sentencing in the following terms (section 9(3)) at [13]:- 

However, the principles mentioned in subs(2)(a) do not apply to the sentencing of an offender for any offence - 

(a) that involved the use of, or counselling or procuring the use of, or attempting or conspiring to use, violence against another person; or 

(b) that resulted in physical harm to another person. 

71In Breeze , the Court of Appeal (Pincus and Davies JJA, Demack J at [18]), applied the remarks of Green CJ in McCrossen , where the Chief Justice had said at [6]:- 

Applying the meaning which the common law has given to the word 'violence' I hold that for the purposes of the [relevant provision] the making of a threat to kill with the intention of intimidating someone is capable of constituting a crime involving an element of violence. 

72The court also placed reliance upon the second of the cases referred to by Mr Arnott on this point. This was the decision of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Butcher [1986] VR 43; (1985) 16 A Crim R 1, in which the question was whether a Victorian provision relating to sentencing, and including the expression ""a crime the necessary elements of which include violence"" applied. Butcher had killed a man in the course of a robbery, but it appeared that the Crown could not prove that this had been done deliberately. Butcher had, however, threatened the man with a knife. The question was whether robbery, under Victorian law, was a crime ""the necessary elements of which include violence"", and the court held that it was. It did so on the ground that robbery, although it may be effected by a threat, was at common law always regarded as a crime of violence. The decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal contained the following observation (at 446):- 

The decision (of Butcher ) is capable of being distinguished, on the ground that the question here is not what are necessary elements of the offence of robbery, but rather whether what was actually done involved the use of violence against the person. 

73In my opinion neither of these cases support the arguments advanced by Mr Arnott. Each of these cases was concerned with a very different statutory context. The Queensland legislation, as Ms Burgess argued, is significantly broader than section 5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act . It required that the issue be considered in the context of the sentencing of an offender when all the relevant facts were in evidence. The determination as to whether the offender had committed an offence that involved the use of violence or resulted in physical harm necessarily required an examination of the facts of the case and could not be confined to the elements of the offence. 

74Mr Arnott has gone with considerable diligence to a number of other authorities in his examination of the use of the word ""involving"" in a criminal context concerning violence. However, with all due respect, none of the cases on which he has placed reliance have the same statutory context as section 5(2)(b) of the Drug Court Act . None of the authorities cast any doubt on the correctness of the decisions of this court in Chandler and Ebsworth nor do they raise any additional matter warranting attention. 

Damage to property 

75I turn to examine the issues raised in Ground 3 of the Summons. This is the question as to whether, on the issue of eligibility, the expression ""violent conduct"" should be restricted to violence to the person. Mr Arnott argued that there is no reason why crimes involving damage to property should not involve violent conduct, and hence, restrict eligibility. In the present case, counsel argued, the damage to property was extensive being, it will be recalled, in excess of $63,000. 

76In my view, however, despite the generality of the language employed in section 5(2)(b), it should not be given the wider meaning contended for by Mr Arnott. 

77It must, of course, be conceded that the language itself is in very general terms (""an offence involving violent conduct""). The phrase, in itself, gives no guidance as to whether any restriction should be employed. There are a number of other considerations, however, which lead to the conclusion I have reached. 

78Firstly, when the phrase is seen in the broader context of the legislation as a whole, considerable insight is gained as to its likely meaning. The legislature has plainly sought to confer the concept of eligibility on a reasonably limited class of offenders. It has done so, however, in order to further the objects of the Drug Court Act . I have earlier set out those objects, and the means by which they are to be achieved. The reduction of drug dependency, and drug-dependent crime in particular, is at the core of the legislation. The interests of the community, and particularly its interest in protection from criminal activity, illuminate the need for reintegration and rehabilitation of drug-dependent offenders. This is achieved through programs which, if successful, will reduce the need for such persons to resort to criminal activity. 

79Secondly, the Act recognises throughout that a balance should be struck. On the one hand, there are the well-recognised objectives of criminal punishment - protection of society, deterrence (both general and personal), accountability, denunciation, retribution and reform. On the other hand, there is the need to subordinate, or at least postpone for a time, those objects in favour of eliminating drug dependency and achieving rehabilitation through means other than immediate confinement to custodial situations. At a practical level, there is a recognition that detoxification programs can, in some instances, with appropriate counselling and treatment, end a drug addiction and successfully counter the factors which have led to that addiction. 

80Thirdly, once appropriate recognition is given to these objects, it is appropriate to give recognition to the fact that the legislation is remedial. It is beneficial, both to the individual and to the public. It is necessary and proper that, in those circumstances, the legislation be construed beneficially ( Bull v Attorney-General (NSW) (1913) 17 CLR 370 at 384; Khoury v Government Insurance Office of (NSW) (1984) 165 CLR 622 at 638 ; Waugh v Kippen (1986) 156 CLR at 164; see also the recent decision of R v Harris [2011] NSWCCA 105 per Simpson J (Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing) at [118]). 

81Fourthly, it is not inappropriate to have regard to the range and nature of matters that are commonly dealt with in the Drug Court. Not surprisingly, the majority of offences dealt with in the Drug Court, since its inception in February 1999, have been ""theft"" charges, including break-and-enter. In addition, property damage has featured regularly, although not to the same extent as the other offences I have mentioned (see NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research - Crime and Justice Bulletins Nos 52 p8 and 88 p6). This pattern has manifested itself, it seems, each year since the Drug Court began its work. The consequence of Mr Arnott's argument, if it were accepted, is that a large number of persons, perhaps the majority, who have successfully made their way through the Drug Court program would have been ineligible for diversion and treatment. Although not conclusive in itself, this suggests that the inclusion of damage to property as a disqualifying factor would scarcely be a beneficial construction of the legislation, and would indeed run counter to its beneficial objects. 

82Fifthly, the issue as to whether the phrase ""offence involving violent conduct"" is to be confined to violence towards a person, was considered by the Drug Court itself as long ago as 2001. In R v Cook [2001] NSWDRGC 9, the then senior judge determined that the phrase should be limited to violence to a person. As I understand it, the Drug Court has, both prior to the decision and since it, followed that position in relation to the interpretation of the statute. It is to be presumed that Parliament has been aware of this approach for more than ten years, and there has been no suggestion that the legislation should be altered or clarified to a contrary effect. 

83Sixthly, there is the reasoning advanced by the primary judge in the present matter. His Honour made a concise but valuable analysis of the situation. Very considerable damage can sometimes be occasioned to premises during a break-in. The example given by his Honour was the illustration of very expensive shopfront windows, or other external property being broken or smashed, or where extensive vandalism occurred during the course of a break-in. Sometimes, the same amount of violence may occasion very expensive damage in one situation, but very little in another. The third example his Honour gave is the situation where damage may be occasioned with no element of violence at all. In the present matter, the primary judge concluded that the fact that very significant material damage had been done to the premises did not of itself elevate the offence to one that demanded ineligibility. In other words, it was his Honour's view (correctly, in my opinion) that section 5(2)(b) is not to be construed, on the issue of eligibility, by some type of comparative analysis of the damage to property. Such a construction is not warranted by the language used and would, if it were adopted, simply become unworkable. 

84This conclusion is, however, both illuminated and tempered by the final matter that is relevant to the determination of the present issue. This is the important issue of the discretion to decline admission to the program, notwithstanding that an offender is otherwise eligible. The availability of this discretion is, in my view, an important factor in reaching the conclusion that the construction urged by Mr Arnott should not be accepted. Indeed, it might be observed that in the decision of her Honour Judge Murrell mentioned earlier ( R v Cook ), her Honour, in the exercise of her discretion, refused to admit Mr Cook to the program, notwithstanding his eligibility. In that case, her Honour held that there was a significant ongoing risk of violence towards members of the community, based on the offender's antecedents and other matters. For that reason, she exercised her discretion against the offender and found that it would be inappropriate to place him on a Drug Court program. It is clear that the Drug Court has, for many years, recognised the existence of this discretion, and its importance in the process, notwithstanding a finding of eligibility. 

85There were two further matters urged by Mr Arnott. The first was a reference to the decision in Antonelli v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] QB 948. In that case, the Court of Appeal had to determine whether the appellant's conviction for arson in the United States was ""an offence involving violent conduct"" within the meaning of the Estate Agents Act 1979 . If it answered that description, it would have resulted in the appellant's disqualification from doing estate agency work in the United Kingdom. Lord Justice Beldam, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, found no justification for confining the word ""violent"" to violence to the person. 

86I do not find this decision to be of any assistance in relation to the interpretation to be given to the relevant phrase that appears in section 5(2) of the Drug Court Act . The decision must be read in its statutory context, and in the light of the policy behind the particular legislation. Beldam LJ noted in that case that the policy behind the legislation was the need to countenance disqualification of a person where that was required for the protection of the public. The wider meaning given to the phrase was required by the context, a context which is rather different from that involved in the legislation under consideration in this matter. 

87The final issue raised by Mr Arnott related to the second question he posed at the outset of his submissions. Should the Drug Court take into account the conduct of the offender in relation to an offence where the wording provides inadequate guidance as to whether the offence could be considered violent conduct? In my view, this question simply does not arise on the face of the reasons in the present matter. As I have indicated earlier, the offence with which the first respondent was charged did not require the proof of any element involving violence towards a person. 

88For all these reasons, I consider that the primary judge was not bound to take into consideration the damage to property alleged in the offence, pursuant to section 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 on the issue of eligibility. His Honour would have been entitled to consider that as a relevant matter on the overall issue of the discretion entrusted to him by the legislation, in determining whether to admit the first respondent to the program. No submission, however, was made to his Honour in that regard. Indeed, the Crown made no submission at all on the damage to property point. The third ground in support of the summons must fail. 

89The applicant has failed to demonstrate error on the face of the reasons. No jurisdictional or other error has been established. In those circumstances, I propose the following order:- 

(1) Summons is dismissed.

2757010,R v Hawi & ors (No 8) [2011] NSWSC 1654,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: It is provided in s 19(1) of the Jury Act 1977 that in any criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court that are to be tried by jury, the jury is to consist of 12 persons, or if the court makes an order under s 19(2) for the selection of additional jurors, 12 persons together with the number of additional jurors ordered by the court. 

2Subsection 2 provides that before a jury is selected in such proceedings the court may order that up to three additional jurors be selected if the court is satisfied that: 

(a) the trial of the proceedings if of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection, and 

(b) the selection of the additional jurors is an appropriate means of ensuring that there will be sufficient jurors remaining on the jury when the jury is required to consider its verdict, and 

(c) appropriate facilities to accommodate the additional jurors are available. 

3No regulations have been made for the purposes of the subsection. Accordingly, the provisions of s 19(3), which is in the following terms, apply: 

(3) Until regulations for the purposes of subsection (2) provide otherwise, a trial of proceedings the duration of which is likely to be more than three months is taken to be a trial of proceedings of a kind prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of that subsection. 

4The estimated length of this trial is in the order of four to five months, with a possibility that it may even extend to six months. Accordingly I am satisfied that this is a trial of proceedings of the kind provided for in s 19(3). 

5I am also satisfied that the selection of additional jurors is an appropriate means of ensuring that there will be sufficient jurors remaining by the time the jury is required to consider its verdicts. Whilst every endeavour is being made to ensure that potential jury members are well aware of the estimated length of the trial, and have been implored to inform me of anything in their personal circumstances that might impact upon their ability to serve for that period of time, there remains the possibility of unforeseen circumstances arising, such as ill-health, that will affect one or more jurors. 

6I have considered the facilities available within the courtroom and in the jury room and I am satisfied they are appropriate to accommodate the additional jurors. 

7Having regard to all of those matters, I order pursuant to section 19(2) that three additional jurors be selected for the jury in this trial.

		09 February 2012",2011-05-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757022,R v Dennison [2011] NSWCCA 114,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA: I agree with Schmidt J. 

2McCALLUM J: I agree with Schmidt J. The sentences imposed were undoubtedly lenient. Nonetheless, for the reasons given by her Honour, I am not persuaded that they entailed error. 

3SCHMIDT J : This is a Crown appeal against sentence in relation to five offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty in April 2010. The respondent was sentenced by his Honour Judge Blackmore as follows: 


Possession of child pornography - s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) - maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment - sentenced to 6 months imprisonment to commence on 23 April 2010 and to expire on 22 October 2010. 

Using a carriage service to access child pornography between 24 March and 13 June 2009 - s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) - maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment - sentenced to 9 months imprisonment to commence on 23 August 2010 and to expire on 22 May 2011. 

Using a carriage service to make available child pornography between 9 March and 28 May 2009 - s 474.19(1)(a)(iv) of the of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) - maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment - sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to commence on 23 May 2011 and to expire on 22 August 2012 - ('the ff model website offence'). 

Using a carriage service to make available child pornography pursuant to s 474.19(1)(a)(iv) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) - maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment - sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to commence on 23 November 2011 and to expire on 22 February 2013 - ('the fame girls web site offence'). 

Dealing in the proceeds of crime pursuit to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) - maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment and/or 1200 penalty units- sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to commence on 23 May 2012 and to expire on 22 August 2013. 

4In the possession of child pornography offence, his Honour was asked to take another such offence into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In the access child pornography offence, his Honour was asked to take another such offence into account pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

5The total sentence imposed was 3 years, 4 months, to commence on 23 April 2010 and to expire on 22 August 2013. His Honour also directed that the respondent be released after serving 2 years imprisonment, conditional upon entering a recognisance in the sum of $5000 to be of good behaviour for a period of 3 years and that he accept the supervision and guidance of the NSW Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions. 

6The Crown appealed the sentence on the following grounds: 
""1. His Honour erred in giving insufficient weight to the offences to be taken into account pursuant to section s 16BA of Crimes Act 1914 (Cth); 

2. His Honour erred in not giving any weight to specific deterrence in the sentence imposed; 

3. His Honour erred in giving insufficient weight to the maximum penalty for the offences; 

4. His Honour erred in finding that substantial concurrence of the sentences imposed for the offences of Using a Carriage Service to Make Available Child Pornography and Dealing in the Proceeds of Crime, was necessary to avoid the prospect of double punishment, and 

5. The sentence was manifestly inadequate."" 


Facts 

7The statement of facts in evidence showed that the respondent became the subject of an Australian Federal Police investigation, while operating a website, 'the ff models website', to which he offered paid membership. 

8There were approximately 60,000 images of three Russian girls, Sandra, Elia and Virginia who were aged between 13 and 16 years, available to be viewed by members on that website. In most images, the girls were provocatively clothed in lingerie and other underwear and were posed in a sexual manner. The images were strongly indicative of a sexual interest in underage girls. The 'ff model website offence' related to the respondent's activities between 9 March and 28 May 2009 in relation to this site, where 2840 images classified as child pornography, depicting 'nudity or sexual posing with no sexual activity', were available. 

9The respondent was also involved in the operation of another member website, the 'fame-girls website'. On this site approximately 20,000 images of the three girls, Sandra, Elia and Virginia were offered to members. They appeared to be aged between approximately 15 and 17 years. The 'fame girls website' offence related to the respondent's activities between 24 March and 13 June 2009 in relation to this site, where 2,217 images classified as child pornography, also depicting 'nudity or sexual posing with no sexual activity', were available. The respondent was also detected participating in online chat on other websites and emails, in which the three girls, their ages and their whereabouts, amongst other things, were discussed. 

10The access child pornography offence concerned the respondent downloading 13 images of child pornography using an internet account which he maintained called the 'pumpkins' account. These images depict another girl, aged approximately 14 years and a male of about 20 years, engaging in oral and vaginal sexual acts. The access child pornography offence taken into account under s 16BA of the Crimes Act (Cth), concerned the respondent using the pumpkins account to access two images of the girl Sandra, when aged about 10 years. In one image, Sandra is depicted naked with her back to the camera and in another, she is topless. 

11A search warrant was executed at the respondent's residential premises. A computer, hard drives and various business records, as well as compact discs and dvds containing material classified as child pornography were seized. The possession of child pornography offence related to various material then seized, which included: 


4374 erotic images with no sexual activity, primarily of girls aged between 8 to 14 years, who were either nude or posed erotically while clothed. 

images depicting sexual activity between a girl between 8 to 10 years, while being masturbated with a syringe placed into her vagina, by another young child. 

images depicting non penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, including a female baby's genitals being spread by an adult and a naked child between 8 and 10 years holding an adult male's erect penis. 

9 images depicting oral, digital and penile penetrative sexual activity between adults and children. 

12The possession of child pornography offence taken into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act related to one written story stored on the computer seized; 30 video files containing 2482 images depicting erotic posing by Ella, Sandra and Virginia, when they were aged between 13 and 15 years, with no sexual activity; five other videos depicting sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by children, and two images depicting non-penetrative sexual activities between adults and children aged between 12 and 14 years. 

13The dealing with proceeds of crime offence related to 550 payments received by the respondent by way of an online Paypal billing account between October 2005 and May 2006 from subscribers to the websites. These transactions equalled approximately $A610,958.39, with further direct deposits and telegraphic transfers of $A16,758.66, as well as cash, cheque and money orders of $A18,575,73, also being received. 

14Information obtained in the investigation had been provided to Russian authorities to assist with their enquiries. This had resulted in the identification and location of Sandra, but not Elia or Virginia. 

15Also in evidence was the transcript of the respondent's record of interview by police, after arrest, where he gave an extensive account of his activities. He did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. The agreed statement noted that during the recorded interview the respondent stated: 


""he was responsible for allocating passwords and usernames to the websites www.ff-models.com and wwwJame-girls.com(sic); 

he received 10% of the subscription fee and transferred the remainder of the money to persons known as 'Vlad' and 'Boris' via overseas accounts; 

he has been responsible for writing sexually explicit captions over images of young female children; 

he believed other subscribers received sexual gratification over images contained on the websites vvww.ff-models.com and www.fame-girls.corn(sic); 

he didn't' believe the images on the websites www.ff-models.com and www.fame-giris.com(sic) were child pornography; 

he was responsible for receiving parcels that subscribers wanted to send to the girls who appeared in the images on the websites www.ff-models.com and www.fame-girls.com, which he would then on-forward to them at an address that only he had knowledge of; and 

he had on several occasions sent parcels on his own behalf to the girls who appeared in the images on the websites www.ff-models.com and www.farne-girls.corn(sic)."" 


Other evidence 

16A sexual assessment report prepared by a counsellor, Morgan Hayward, was in evidence. There it was noted that the respondent was aged 47 years, single with no children and not involved in any relationship. He operated the website business and also had employment in the printing industry. He had no criminal record. 

17Mr Hayward's report recounted that the respondent suffered from chronic asthma and airway limitations. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Mr Hayward reported the respondent's confusion that his actions were interpreted, so as to result in criminal charges. He believed that Sandra needed monetary help to further her education and her standard of living in Russia and believed that promoting her as a model, would do that. He did not believe her to be in physical danger, or in an abusive relationship with the overseas promoters of the two websites. He had been smitten by Sandra, but during treatment had come to recognise that he had been misled by the Russian promoters, who had abused his altruistic intentions. He accepted that Sandra had been preyed upon by them. 

18The respondent claimed to condemn the physical and sexual abuse of children and to find such behaviour abhorrent. He claimed not to have understood that the promotion of child pornography could take many forms and that fantasies might incite child sexual interest and lead to child sexual abuse. 

19Mr Hayward was of the view that the respondent's desire to engage sexually with children for his sexual gratification was not a threat, so long as he received therapy to gain control of manipulative behaviour by others. His prognosis not to engage in child pornography seemed favourable in the short term, as he moved towards acceptance of his misbehaviour. Long term this depended on his willingness to continue with rehabilitation. Various means of rehabilitation were proposed by Mr Hayward, who also noted that the respondent feared for his physical and psychological safety, if imprisoned. 

20Reports of psychiatrists, Dr Glass and Dr Murugesan, were also in evidence. The respondent's problems with identity and drug and alcohol abuse were noted. A fantasy life of drinking and viewing images of young girls and writing comments and captions for images was described. Physical contact was denied. The respondent's realization that his behaviour was criminal, leading to remorse, was discussed. Chronic dysthymic disorder, in the form of chronic low grade depression, was diagnosed, but no personality disorder was found. An isolated life, with the respondent's drinking impaired judgment was discussed. A prison sentence was thought to have a deleterious effect on the respondent's fragile mental state. 

The Crown's case below 

21The Crown emphasised the need for general and specific deterrence to be taken into account in sentencing, notwithstanding the pleas which had been entered, given the serious nature of the child pornography offences charged. 

22The factors discussed in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; (2005) 162 A Crim R 29, were submitted to be relevant to be considered in determining the sentences imposed. It was argued that the offender was the main principal in the commission of the offences, the other principals being based in Russia. He was the essential link with the subscribers to the website and not only accessed images himself, but made them available to others. 

23The children depicted were submitted to be the victims of the offences. Their images could be swapped, traded and sold potentially in perpetuity in the internet child pornography trade. 

24The proceeds of crime offence was also submitted to be serious, given the amount of money involved and the respondent's receipt, control and distribution of the money generated. 

25The respondent's early pleas were acknowledged as entitling him to an element of leniency, indicative of his willingness to facilitate the course of justice, but the strength of the Crown case was submitted to reflect that the pleas were also a recognition of the inevitable. The respondent's personal circumstances were addressed and it was submitted that an aggravating factor was that he had acted with other offenders. The need to consider whether the sentences should be served concurrently, or cumulatively was accepted. 

26As to the sentencing range, it was argued that full time imprisonment was required. A number of authorities were provided to assist in the determination of the range. 

The respondent's case 

27The respondent conceded that the offences to which he had entered a plea were serious and would result in a custodial sentence. Bail was not sought and it was accepted that general deterrence was an important aspect of the sentencing exercise. It was also accepted that prior good character could not make much difference to the sentence to be imposed, given the serious nature of the offences. It was argued, however, that account would be taken of the evidence as to the reasons for the respondent's involvement, which had resulted from his infatuation with the girl Sandra. It was also submitted that he was involved in the websites as a cog, or agent in the enterprise, rather than as a principal. 

28It was submitted to be relevant that only 5% of the 90,000 images in total were classified as child pornography, with none depicting nudity. The images fell at the bottom of the internationally recognised COPINE scale, as did the vast majority of the pornographic images in the respondent's possession. Most depicted children in their late teens. 

29That the respondent had profited from the operation of the website was accepted to be relevant to sentence. It was argued, however, that it was also relevant that the income derived had never been hidden, supportive of the existence of the respondent's belief that he was not involved in a criminal enterprise. There had been no attempt to evade tax. 

30Considerable emphasis was placed on the early plea, which was undiminished, it was argued, by any suggestion that the Crown case was a strong one. Account would also be taken of the respondent's full co-operation on arrest and that he had made admissions on significant matters, contrary to his interest. 

The sentencing remarks 

31His Honour gave a summary of the agreed facts, before turning to consider the sentences to be imposed. He took the view that the facts disclosed a series of distinct offences, which did not all relate to one episode of criminal conduct. He also took the view that the activities involved in running the business and distributing the images available on the websites, needed to be considered separately from the respondent's other activities. 

The 'fame girl' and 'ff model' website offences 

32His Honour first dealt with the two charges relating to the respondent's 'involvement with the running of the business or the distribution of images of young girls'. He noted that the respondent had told police that he did not believe that the images were child pornography, but he understood that people who viewed the images were obtaining sexual gratification from such viewing. 

33His Honour observed that 'as child pornography, the material is a bit unusual'. This was because the girls were clothed and the photos did not depict explicit sexual activity and mostly did not depict any sexual pose. His Honour noted that of approximately 80,000 images, over 4,000 were classified as child pornography. In his view, only about 5% fell within the more usual child pornography which came before the Court and the rest fell within 'a shadowy area between child pornography and voyeurism'. 

34His Honour noted that the respondent was aware that people were paying significant sums to view the photos; that they were doing so for sexual gratification; that he had a degree of control over the web pages and that he had a responsibility to ensure the material shown was not child pornography. 

35His Honour then turned to consider the objective seriousness of the offences and the offender's role in them. He referred to the categorisation of child pornography in R v Oliver [2003] 1 Cr App R 28 and that adopted in the COPINE project, concluding that all of the 4,000 images fell into the least serious categories. In R v Oliver , that scale was described as: 
""(1) images depicting erotic posing with no sexual activity; 
(2) sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child; 
(3) non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children; 
(4) penetrative sexual activity between children and adults; 
(5) sadism or bestiality."" 

36After referring to the respondent's role in distributing the material, his Honour concluded that the whole venture could not have proceeded without his involvement, or that of someone like him. He had protected the Russians involved. His Honour also noted the respondent's knowledge that people were paying for the images for sexual gratification and that he had a degree of control over the web pages. 

37His Honour declined to describe the respondent as a principal or agent, but turned to consider what he actually did; namely, having a significant involvement in the distribution of child pornography on the internet, for significant amounts of money, in order to protect the identity of those controlling the young girls whose images were depicted. 

38His Honour regarded the respondent's view that he was assisting the girls to be self delusional. They were plainly being exploited. Their situation and circumstances were unknown, but the consequences of their exploitation was not, with their images distributed worldwide, available to be viewed where ever the internet operated. His Honour also noted that the respondent's activities were easier to detect than peer to peer transmission on the internet. That similar or worse material could be accessed peer to peer, did not, however, affect the Court discouraging the respondent's profit from the exploitation of children. 

39The payments which he received were found to be an aggravating factor. While the way in which the business was conducted made the respondent easy to detect, still the offence was committed for financial gain, which encouraged the commission of offences. Account had to be taken of the substantial reward achieved for the respondent's efforts, but his Honour took the view that care had to be taken, to ensure there was no double counting in relation to those payments, in respect of the money laundering charge. 

40The offences were considered to be serious, given the respondent's significant role. His Honour concluded: 
""In my view, his role involved the exploitation of the victims, that is the girls depicted on the Internet. Looking purely at the images themselves, I accept that these images are objectively at the bottom of the range. The fact that the offender received financial gain for depicting the images, aggravates the seriousness of the offence as earlier discussed. Overall, the offences are not ones at the bottom of the range and I would estimate that they fall somewhere between the bottom and middle range of objective seriousness."" 


41His Honour took the view that general deterrence was of paramount consideration in this type of offence, which was rarely detected. General deterrence required that a penalty of full-time custody be imposed. 

The access child pornography offence 

42His Honour then turned to consider the respondent's own access of a relatively small number of child pornography images, of other children. He referred to the matters which required consideration in determining the objective seriousness of such an offence, discussed in R v Gent . 

43His Honour took the view that the images fell into category 4 of the Oliver scale. Nevertheless, his Honour concluded that the offence objectively fell above the bottom of the range, due to the gravity of the sexual activity, but well below the middle range of objective seriousness. 

The possession of child pornography offence 

44His Honour noted that this offence related to over 4,000 images found in the respondent's possession, most of which fell into the lowest category referred to in Oliver , with some 13 images falling into the more serious categories. His Honour concluded that 'objectively this offence is well above the bottom of the range but does not reach the middle of the range of objective seriousness due to the low categorisation of most of the images.' 

The proceeds of crime offence 

45His Honour concluded that while it carried the longest maximum penalty, the question of double punishment had to be avoided, the sums received having been taken into account in the transmitting child pornography offences. 

46His Honour referred to the respondent's account in the record of interview, that he kept 10% of money deposited and 30% of cash and sent the rest to Russia, after meeting expenses. Thereby his Honour noted, he had concealed the involvement of the Russian men in this operation. His Honour distinguished Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; (2010) 201 A Crim R 150, noting that receipt of money was not an element of the using a carriage service offences. Nevertheless, he took the view that substantial concurrence in the penalties imposed was required, in order to avoid double punishment. 

47His Honour then turned to consider subjective matters, which it is not necessary to outline in detail. He came to the view that the evidence showed that the respondent was aware of the sexual interest of subscribers in the children depicted and had similar feelings himself. Nevertheless, he accepted that he was a victim of sorts of the Russians, who had latched on his vulnerabilities. He also took the view that the respondent was playing on others' vulnerabilities, in order to make money from what he described as a 'despicable trade', knowing that what he was doing was criminally wrong. His Honour concluded that the circumstances did not remove the need for the sentence to reflect specific deterrence. He concluded, however, that a non-parole period should be set at the bottom of the usual range. 

48His Honour noted that he had considered s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth) and s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and then imposed the sentences appealed from, noting in relation to the possessing child pornography offence and the access child pornography offence that he had taken the additional offences into account. The sentences imposed were partially accumulated. 

Ground 1 - His Honour erred in giving insufficient weight to the offence to be taken into account under s16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 

49The Crown's case was that the sentence of 9 months' imprisonment imposed for the principal offence under s 479.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act , use of carriage service to access child pornography, after taking into account the further offence, was manifestly inadequate, having in mind the serious criminality involved in the principal offence. The sentence imposed also reflected that no, or insufficient account was taken of the other offence to be taken into account under s 16BA of the Crimes Act (Cth) . 

50The respondent's case was that his Honour had not fallen into such error. His Honour's sentencing remarks showed that he had not overlooked any relevant factor and had arrived at a sentence which properly reflected the purpose for which the system established by s 16BA was devised, as discussed by Spigelman CJ in Re Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [66]. 

51The principle to be applied is that explained by Spigelman CJ who there observed: 
""39 The sentencing court is sentencing only for the ""principal offence"". It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a ""discount"" for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence. 

40 In my opinion, it is pertinent to identify the elements to be considered in determining the sentence for the primary offence upon which the commission of other offences, for which no conviction is being recorded, may impinge. The case law has identified a number of distinct and sometimes overlapping purposes to be served by sentencing. In my opinion, not all these purposes are relevant to the process of taking other offences into account, when sentencing for a particular offence, i.e. the primary offence. 

41 In Barton at [64], in a passage subsequently referred to in R v AEM Snr at [81] and R v Perese at [81], I made some observations which I repeat. 

42 The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 

43 I did not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. However, no additional elements for which that could be so have been identified in submissions to this Court. The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence. 

44 The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account Form 1 offences. (See R v Kay at [69].) 

45 The suggestion in the Attorney's proposed guideline that the increase in penalty should normally be specified may have been appropriate if the Attorney's basic approach were to be adopted, i.e. that in some senses sentences were being imposed for the Form 1 offences. Once that approach is rejected, specification of quantum is inappropriate. 

66 The effect of inclusion on a Form 1 is to give the offences so included a significantly lower salience in the sentencing process. There will be an obvious advantage, and hence a greater incentive to admit guilt, where the Form 1 procedure is employed. In my opinion, the issues that arise are broadly equivalent to those involved in the Crown deciding not to prosecute for the full range of offences open to it or to accept a plea to a lesser charge, albeit in the context of multiple, and often divergent, criminal offences."" 


52It is apparent from his Honour's sentencing remarks that he did not overlook the offence to be taken into account under s 16BA. At various points, his Honour referred to the two other offences which had to be taken into account in relation to the State possession of child pornography offence and the Commonwealth accessing child pornography offence, including when he finally turned to the sentence. 

53The access child pornography offence concerned the respondent downloading 13 images of child pornography using the 'pumpkins' account. The images depict a fourth unidentified girl, aged approximately 14 years and a male of about 20 years, engaging in oral and vaginal sexual acts. The access child pornography offence taken into account under s 16BA concerned the respondent using the 'pumpkins' account to access two images of the girl Sandra, when aged about ten years. In one image Sandra is depicted naked with her back to the camera and in another, she is topless. 

54His Honour took the view that the 13 images with which the principal offence was concerned fell into category 4 on the Oliver scale. There was no complaint about that finding, nor as to the description of the offence, by reference to the discussion in R v Gent . His Honour's conclusion that the offence objectively fell above the bottom of the range, due to the objective gravity of the sexual activity involved, but well below the mid-range of objective seriousness, was however, submitted to involve error. 

55In R v Gent , the necessity to consider not only the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity depicted, but also the number of images involved, whether they were obtained for the purpose of sale and whether the offender would profit from the offence, was discussed. In this case there was no evidence that these 13 images were obtained for sale, or that the respondent had profited from this offence, as he had in relation to the other offences involved in his operation of the two websites. 

56The sentence imposed was 9 months imprisonment, his Honour noting that in coming to that conclusion, he had also taken into account the additional charge. His Honour was criticised for not having referred to the detail of the second offence which had to be taken into account. He had referred to that offence earlier in his sentencing remarks, where he noted that the facts of that offence were outlined in the agreed facts, which he did not repeat. 

57That offence concerned accessing two images of the girl Sandra, when aged about ten years. In one image, Sandra was depicted naked with her back to the camera and in another, she is topless. In my assessment it must be accepted that this offence was less serious than the principal offence, given the number of images involved and what was depicted. There was also no evidence that these two images were obtained for sale, or that the respondent had profited from this offence. True it is that the respondent's possession of these images revealed the extent and nature of his obsession with the girl Sandra. Nevertheless, what his Honour was obliged to assess was the nature and seriousness of this offence and what impact that should have on the sentence imposed in respect of the principal offence. 

58As the respondent submitted, there was no necessity for his Honour to quantify the additional penalty imposed in respect of the additional offence taken into account. The sentence imposed for the principal offence had to reflect the criminality involved in both offences, as the facts disclosed. On those facts, a higher penalty than that which would have otherwise been appropriate for the principal offence, had to be imposed, but in my assessment, not substantially higher. 

59That his Honour erred in the account taken of the additional offence under s 16BA was in my view not established. The offence was clearly not overlooked. It is also necessary to consider whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, having in mind what had to be taken into account. I will deal separately with that question. 

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in not giving weight to specific deterrence in the sentence imposed 
Ground 3 - His Honour erred in giving insufficient weight to the maximum penalty for the offences 
Ground 4 - His Honour erred in finding that substantial concurrence of the sentences imposed for the offences of Using a Carriage Service to Make Available Child Pornography and Dealing in the Proceeds of Crime, was necessary to avoid the prospect of double punishment 
Ground 5 - the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 

60It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together, as the parties addressed them. 

61The maximum penalties for the access and use of carriage service offences and for the possession offence were each 10 years' imprisonment. That for the proceeds of crime offence was 20 years. Against those maximum penalties, his Honour had to impose sentences proportionate to the gravity of each offence, having regard to the evidence as to both objective and subjective matters, paying attention to the need for specific and general deterrence and applying the principle of totality. As discussed in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481: 

""12 In R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245, Street CJ described the principle as follows: (at 260) 

"" ... The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing Judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing Judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences. ... "" "" 


62The application of the principle must not result in the suggestion that there has been a discount for multiple offending (see R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [18]). There must be effective punishment for a person who has committed a series of discrete offences. 

63In reaching his conclusions, his Honour also took into account the pleas entered at the earliest opportunity, observing that this may have been little more than a recognition of the inevitable, but he accepted that it had facilitated justice. His Honour also considered the need for general and specific deterrence and the need to avoid double punishment in respect of the sums earned in relation to the operation of the websites, both an aggravating consideration in the case of two of the offences and itself the subject of a separate charge. 

64His Honour imposed individual sentences, also dealing with questions of the accumulation and concurrency of the sentences imposed. The final result was a total sentence for the five offences, including the two for which two further Form offences were taken into consideration, of 3 years, 4 months. 

65The Crown's case was that the result of his Honour's approach was that inadequate weight had been given to the need for specific deterrence; insufficient attention had been paid to the maximum penalties imposed for the offences; and that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. 

66The Crown submitted that the maximum penalties reflected the Parliament's view of the seriousness of child pornography offences using the internet. Recognition that the problem of child pornography is Australia wide and indeed, international had been repeatedly discussed in jurisdictions around Australia and overseas. The paramount importance of deterrence in the imposition of sentences for such offences had also been widely and repeatedly discussed. His Honour erred in the view he took of the subjective evidence, so that specific deterrence was not given adequate weight. While his Honour referred to the principles he was bound to apply, the sentences imposed revealed that they had not been given effect, with the result that they were manifestly inadequate. 

67The respondent's case was that there had been no error of fact or principle in his Honour's approach or conclusions. His Honour had taken the view that deterrence was of paramount importance and had given effect to that view, while also paying appropriate regard to what the respondent had actually done and to his subjective circumstances, as he was bound to do. The sentences had not been made wholly concurrent, but had given effect to his Honour's view that distinct offences had been committed, but double counting had to be avoided. 

68In my view it must be accepted that the sentences imposed were relatively lenient. Nevertheless, even if the members of this Bench would have imposed higher sentences, the question of whether the sentences are manifestly inadequate must be answered in the negative, if they fall within the available range (see Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671-2). For reasons which I will explain, it seems to me that while they lie at the very bottom of that range, that they are manifestly inadequate was not established. Nor can it be concluded that insufficient weight was given to specific deterrence, or that his Honour failed to have proper regard to the maximum penalties for the offences. 

69In advancing its case, reference was made by the Crown to what was said in various Second Reading speeches, when these offences were dealt with by the State and Federal Parliaments, as well as a number of intermediate appellate court decisions in various Australian jurisdictions, which evidenced a concern about the deterrent effect of sentences imposed in prosecutions of child pornography offences pursued under both State and Federal criminal laws. 

70In R v Mara [2009] QCA 208; (2009) 196 A Crim R 506 it was observed, for example by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland at [17] - [21]: 
""17 In the oft quoted words of Kennedy J in R v Jones ((1999) 108 A Crim R 50 at [9]) - 

""The production of child pornography for dissemination involves the exploitation and corruption of children who are incapable of protecting themselves. The collection of such material is likely to encourage those who are actively involved in corrupting the children involved in the sexual activities depicted and who recruit and use those children for the purpose of recording and distributing the results. The offence of possessing child pornography cannot be characterised as a victimless crime. The children, in the end, are the victims."" 

18 The provisions of the Commonwealth and State Criminal Codes breached by the applicant's offending conduct are directed at different aspects of the distribution and possession of child pornography. The Commonwealth provision focuses on the use of the internet to access and transmit child exploitation images, while the State legislation is concerned with the possession, preservation and sharing of such images. The maximum penalty for the Commonwealth offences was 10 years, imprisonment and that for the State offence 20 years. 

19 The sentencing judge observed perceptively - 

""The widespread use of the internet makes available to the international community of people like you an unprecedented volume of pornography in many forms that involve the exploitation of innocent children including defenceless and helpless infants to feed the craving for personal sexual gratification of a paedophilic nature, and to enable people such as you to interact together in the celebration of your cruel, unnatural and disgusting perversion. 

The level of sophistication and attention to security in these offences demonstrate the lengths to which sexual predators such as you and the other faceless and largely undetected participants in this criminal enterprise are prepared to go."" 

20 Denunciation and deterrence (both general and personal) are particularly powerful considerations in sentencing for child pornography offences. ( R v Carson [2008] QCA 268 at [32]; R v Plunkett [2006] QCA 182 at [6]; R v Wharley [2007] QCA 295 at [17].) 

21 In R v Gent , ((2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at [99].) a decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Johnson J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) identified the range of factors relevant to the objective seriousness of an offence of possession or importation of child pornography as including - 

(a) the nature and content of the pornographic material - including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed; 

(b) the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender; 

(c) whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of sale or further distribution; 

(d) whether the offender will profit from the offence. 

His Honour continued - 

""It might be worth noting, however, that the number of images as such may not be the real point. In a case of possession of child pornography for personal use only, the significance of quantity lies more in the number of different children who are depicted and thereby victimised."" 

Those considerations are also apt in sentencing for the offences committed by the applicant. (See James v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 62 at [10] - [11].)"" 

71More recently in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; (2010) 201 A Crim R 243, Hulme J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed) discussed recent authorities which have dealt with matters relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences which relate to child pornography: R v Gent , Whiley v R [2010] NSWCCA 53 , R v Oliver and R v Mara . At [94] - [95] his Honour concluded: 
""94 Drawing primarily from the authorities to which I have referred, the following matters may be relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of offences involving the possession or dissemination/transmission of child pornography: 

1. Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material. 

2. The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed. 

3. The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material. 

4. The number of images or items of material - in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted. 

5. In a case of possession, the offender's purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

6. In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted. 

7. Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission. 

8. The proximity of the offender's activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence. 

9. The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material. 

10. Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons. 

11. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children. 

12. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted. 

13. Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence. 

95 This list of factors is, of course, not closed. Individual cases may always produce further matters relevant to the assessment of their objective seriousness."" 


72From his sentencing remarks it is apparent that his Honour paid regard to these matters; that he did not overlook the maximum penalties for the offences and that he took the view that both general and specific deterrence had to feature in the sentences imposed. His Honour also had regard, as he was bound to do, to the evidence as to the respondent's subjective circumstances, relevant to determining the extent of the role which specific deterrence had to play in those sentences. 

73That the respondent was rather delusional in his approach to the criminal enterprise in which he had become involved, must be accepted. He claimed after his arrest that he had no appreciation that the material disseminated on the websites was pornographic, or that he was involved in any crime. That this was truly his belief was supported by the way in which the business was conducted. There was no attempt to hide his activities. Membership to the websites was freely available on payment. Potential members were not screened. The business was operated as any legitimate internet business might be. The respondent disclosed all he earned in his tax returns, some $85,000 out of the over $650,000 revenue generated in the business. The respondent's activities were clearly easily uncovered, once investigated. 

74That the respondent had an unhealthy, indeed criminal interest in the three girls depicted on these websites, was accepted, soon after he was arrested, with the result the pleas which he entered. Given the number and nature of the pornographic images offered on the website and the serious nature of some of the other material which was found in his possession and in respect of which he was then charged, his Honour's view that his pleas reflected an acceptance of the inevitable, may well be understood. Nevertheless, it was not material of that serious kind with which the very vast majority of the pornographic materials which he accessed and distributed on the two websites was concerned. The material which fell at the upper levels of the COPINE scale were not distributed. They were the subject of the possession and access charges. 

75The sentences imposed in Mara and Minehan were relied on by the Crown to establish the manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed. While we were referred to a plethora of other decided cases, it was accepted that they established no particular sentencing pattern on which the Crown could rely. Nor were the facts of any other particular case submitted to reveal the manifest inadequacy of the sentences here imposed. It is unnecessary to refer further to these cases. 

76So far as the comparisons sought to be drawn with Mara and Minehan are concerned, in my view the facts on which the sentences there imposed rested, are so different that they do not provide any useful basis for comparisons to be drawn. 

77Minehan was concerned with an offender in respect of whom admitted technical errors were made on sentencing, which had the result that an overall sentence of 6 years, 4 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years, was reduced to 5 years, 2 months. Otherwise the sentences were not interfered with on appeal. The defendent was there charged with nine Commonwealth and State child pornography offences, with a further ten offences being taken into account under s 16BA. The offences involved telephone calls with a school boy in which masturbation was discussed; text messages describing sexual attraction to adolescent boys; disseminating child pornography, photographs and videos depicting adolescent and preadolescent males engaging in sexual activity, sometimes with adult males; in one case of a boy aged about 10 years, whose hands and feet were bound by rope behind his back, while an obese middle aged male engaged in sexual intercourse with him; disseminating other videos and still images of naked and partially naked children aged 9 to 14 years, while engaging in oral and anal sexual intercourse; transmission of a graphic pornographic story by email; grooming a person under 16 years for sexual activity; further video and photographic material depicting young males, some under 10 years, engaging in sexual activity; further videos and still images depicting boys aged between 8 and 16 years engaging in various sexual activity. Some 70 movies or videos and 2300 images in all were involved, spanning from the least to the most serious classification on the scale. The offences were found to fall within the mid-range of objective seriousness and the defendant was described as a predator and significant danger to the community. 

78In my view the circumstances of Minehan provide no useful comparators for this case. Clearly the offences which there arose to be considered were more serious than those with which the respondent was charged. Nor do the circumstances dealt with in Mara reveal that the sentences imposed in this case were inadequate. 

79In Mara, the defendant was charged with three Commonwealth and one State offence. He and three others were found to have had the objective of pursuing a common interest in child pornography by the use of internet newsgroups. They screened, tested and subsequently admitted new members to those groups. They and two others comprised the ""administrators"", who were identified by nicknames and who oversaw the internal workings of the groups (including structure, instructions relating to security and the expectations placed upon members), as well as their evolution. Other members of the group were known as a ""trustworthy"". None of the group members knew the true identity of any of the other members. 

80The groups traded in a large quantity of child exploitation material, as well as purchasing and commissioning the production of such material, which was posted to the newsgroups as binary files that were unable to be viewed by anyone who did not have a ""key"". The groups used highly sophisticated techniques to avoid detection, including - 
""encryption that required the use of paired encryption keys to view the material and to communicate with other members: the keys were changed regularly (at least 15 times), and involved three different levels of security; 
frequently changing nicknames; 
changing the newsgroup location (on six occasions); 
changing the file extension so as to disguise the nature of the file contents; and 
utilising a program written by a group member specifically to automate the file extension change process."" 


81The offences concerned some 444,000 images and 1,100 movie/video files of child exploitation material, which had been uploaded and advertised for use by the group. It was noted at [9] that the trial judge found: 
""The images overall were primarily of female children from babies to pre-pubescent age. They involved ejaculation, oral sex, vaginal and anal penetration. In one of the images ... there was a female child five to eight years being vaginally and orally penetrated for a period of just under two minutes. There are images of infants being abused by adults in an abominable way. Some of the material that was uncovered in the investigation had been seen before by investigators but there was material that they had never seen before."" 


82The sentences originally imposed on counts 1 - 3 were six years' imprisonment with a direction that the offender be released after serving 32 months (ie 45 per cent of the head sentence), upon his giving security by recognizance in the sum of $1,000, conditional that he be of good behaviour for three years and subject to the supervision of a probation officer for 18 months. On count 4, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. All the sentences were to be served concurrently. 

83In my view these sentences also shed no light on the adequacy of the sentences imposed in this case, given the very differing factual circumstances which arose to be considered. The offences dealt with in Mara were clearly of a much more serious kind than those arising to be dealt with in this case, even given the more serious pornographic material found in the respondent's possession, which was the subject of the possession and access charges. 

84The sentences imposed in respect of the two using carriage service offences had to reflect the nature of the child pornography distributed, as well as the respondent's role in the website business which he operated together with the Russians, as well as what he gained from his involvement. 

85The Crown argued that his Honour erred in the conclusions he reached, given the nature of the commercial enterprise in which the respondent was engaged. It was particularly argued that his Honour erred in his view that the respondent was a victim of, or vulnerable to, the Russians who supplied the images used on the two websites. The evidence established that he was a principal or significant player in the operation, with the result that specific deterrence had to feature in the sentences imposed. He was the lynchpin of the operation. He committed the offences for his own sexual gratification, as well as substantial financial reward. The respondent profited from the business which he conducted, attracting like minded people to these sites. It followed that specific deterrence had not been given adequate effect by the sentence imposed. 

86I am not able to accept this submission. His Honour's sentencing remarks do not reveal that he misunderstood the evidence. His approach was to sentence the respondent having regard to what he did, rather than by a characterisation of the kind that either the Crown or the respondent invited. He also paid proper regard to the subjective evidence, as well as the aggravating factor that the respondent profited from these offences. 

87As to this, the evidence was that the payments made by users of the two websites was for access to all of the images there available. Only the minority of them, albeit over some 6,000 images, involved child pornography, all at a low level. The respondent received no separate payment when these images were accessed, as opposed to those which did not depict child pornography. 

88The subjective evidence disclosed a belief that the images available on the websites were not child pornography and that there was no criminal activity involved in the operation of the websites; there was no prior criminal record; and an approach to the operation of the business consistent with a belief that there was no criminal activity involved. There was also psychiatric evidence as to the existence of a belief that the respondent was assisting the three girls depicted on the site and of his infatuation with the girl Sandra. This evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent had a complete lack of insight at the time of the offences. Unquestionably, had the respondent operated the business believing that he was engaging in and profiting from a criminal enterprise, objectively these would have been more serious offences. 

89The respondent's early plea reflected an acceptance that his subjective belief was wrong. His Honour clearly accepted the case advanced for the respondent, that while general and specific deterrence had a role to play in the sentences imposed, account had to be taken of the subjective evidence, in determining the extent to which specific deterrence would feature in the sentences imposed. 

90In my view there was no error in that approach. While the result was sentences at the lower end of the available range, that they were manifestly inadequate, was not shown. 

91Nor was error established in relation to the access child pornography offence, which his Honour concluded fell above the bottom of the range, but well below the middle range of objective seriousness. That his Honour took the view that these images fell into category 4 of the Oliver Scale, is not inconsistent with that conclusion. The nature of the images involved was not the only matter necessary to be taken into account in arriving at a conclusion as to the seriousness of the offence. That his Honour also had to take into account the two images of the girl Sandra, which were the subject of the charge which had to be taken into under s 16BA, can lead to no different conclusion, given the nature of that offence. I have already discussed that issue in relation to Ground 1. Nor was his conclusion that the possession offence fell above the bottom of the range, but below the middle shown to reflect error given what was the subject of those offences. 

92In the case of the dealing in proceeds of crime offence, his Honour sentenced the offender, by reference to the evidence of his acts in operating the business, together with the Russians involved, as well as his subjective circumstances. There was no error of principle in the approach adopted. It was consistent with the requirements of 16A of the Crimes Ac t (Cth). Aggravating and mitigating factors were relevant to be taken into account, as were the respondent's subjective circumstances. Nor was any error of fact established. In my view of the evidence, the approach adopted and the sentences which resulted, were open to his Honour. 

93His Honour also considered the question of double counting, as he was obliged to do. That the respondent profited was taken into account as an aggravating factor in the use carriage service offences. His Honour took care to ensure that this was taken into account when sentencing in the proceeds of crime offence. That approach was not inconsistent with the conclusion that the offences to which the pleas had been entered were separate and distinct. 

94As his Honour accepted, when he imposed the sentence for the proceeds of crime offence, he had to ensure that the offence did not go unpunished, but there was a need to avoid double punishment . That was consistent with the approach discussed in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623 (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ): 

""To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts."" 



95It is not only the commonality of the legal elements of the offences which had to be considered, but also the commonality of the facts and circumstances (see R v Hilton [2005] NSWCCA 317; (2005) 157 A Crim R 504 at [15]). As explained in R v Elphick [2010] NSWCCA 112, when an offender is being punished for more than one offence arising out of the same set of facts, the need to avoid punishing an offender twice does not require that elements which are common to any overlapping offences with which the offender is charged be ignored. Rather, it is necessary to consider, independently, the facts and circumstances relevant to the sentence imposed for the first offence and to sentence accordingly. Then, when turning to deal with the second offence, 'any necessary step in assessment of punishment for that crime to avoid that which would amount to double punishment can be taken' (at [29]). That was the approach which his Honour took. 

96The number of transactions, the period over which they occurred, the amounts involved and what became of the money, were all matters necessary to be taken into account in fixing penalty for the proceeds of crime offence (see R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; (2007) 174 A Crim R 370 at [32] - [36]). These were all matters which his Honour considered in coming to his conclusions on sentence. 

97I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed, albeit in my view also at the lowest end of the range, was shown to be manifestly inadequate. That his Honour erred in the conclusions which he reached, was in my view not established. 

98In my view it follows that the appeal must be dismissed. 

The Suitors' Fund Act 1951 

99The appeal was listed for hearing in February 2011. The respondent elected, as he was entitled to do, to be present at the hearing, but through no fault on his part the necessary administrative arrangements were overlooked, with the result that he was not present that day. The hearing was accordingly adjourned, with the result that the respondent incurred additional costs. 

100In the circumstances the respondent made an application for a certificate under either ss 6A or 6C of the Suitors' Fund Act in relation to those costs. The sections provide: 
6A Costs of proceedings not completed by reason of death of judge etc 
(1) Where on or after the day on which Her Majesty's assent to the Suitors' Fund (Amendment) Act 1959 is signified: 
(a) any civil or criminal proceedings are rendered abortive by the death or protracted illness of the judge or magistrate before whom the proceedings were had, 
(a1) any civil or criminal proceedings are rendered abortive for the purposes of this paragraph by section 46A (Appeal against damages may be heard by 2 Judges) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 or section 6AA (Appeal against sentence may be heard by 2 judges) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, because the judges who heard the proceedings were divided in opinion as to the decision determining the proceedings, 
(b) an appeal on a question of law against the conviction of a person (in this section referred to as the appellant) convicted on indictment is upheld and a new trial is ordered, or 
(c) the hearing of any civil or criminal proceedings is discontinued and a new trial ordered by the presiding judge or magistrate for a reason not attributable in any way to disagreement on the part of the jury, where the proceedings were with a jury, or to the act, neglect or default, in the case of civil proceedings, of all or of any one or more of the parties thereto or their counsel or attorneys, or, in the case of criminal proceedings, of the accused or the accuser's counsel or attorney, and the presiding judge or magistrate grants a certificate (which certificate the presiding judge or magistrate is hereby authorised to grant): 
(i) in the case of civil proceedings-to any party thereto stating the reason why the proceedings were discontinued and a new trial ordered and that the reason was not attributable in any way to disagreement on the part of the jury, where the proceedings were with a jury, or to the act, neglect or default of all or of any one or more of the parties to the proceedings or their counsel or attorneys, or 
(ii) in the case of criminal proceedings-to the accused stating the reason why the proceedings were discontinued and a new trial ordered and that the reason was not attributable in any way to disagreement on the part of the jury or to the act, neglect or default of the accused or the accuser's counsel or attorney, 
and any party to the civil proceedings or the accused in the criminal proceedings or the appellant, as the case may be, incurs additional costs (in this section referred to as additional costs) by reason of the new trial that is had as a consequence of the proceedings being so rendered abortive or as a consequence of the order for a new trial, as the case may be, then the Director-General may, upon application made in that behalf, authorise the payment from the Fund to the party or the accused or the appellant, as the case may be, of the costs (in this section referred to as original costs), or such part thereof as the Director-General may determine, incurred by the party or the accused or the appellant, as the case may be, in the proceedings before they were so rendered abortive or the conviction was quashed or the hearing of the proceedings was so discontinued, as the case may be. 
(1A) Where, in the opinion of the Director-General: 
(a) the Director-General would, but for this subsection, not be entitled to authorise payment of an amount to a person under subsection (1) because that person incurred neither original costs nor additional costs by reason only of the fact that that person was a legally assisted person, and 
(b) that person would have incurred original costs and additional costs had that person not been a legally assisted person, 
subsection (1) shall apply to and in respect of that person as if that person had not been a legally assisted person and as if that person had incurred such original costs and additional costs as the Director-General determines: 
Provided that the Director-General may, in lieu of authorising payment under that subsection of an amount to that person, authorise payment of that amount to such person or persons as in the Director-General's opinion is or are entitled to receive payment thereof. 
(1B) If an application has been made under subsection (1) in respect of proceedings rendered abortive, or a new trial ordered, after the commencement of the Suitors' Fund (Amendment) Act 1987, the amount payable under that subsection to any one person shall, in respect of that application, not exceed: 
(a) $10,000, or 
(b) such other amount as may be prescribed (at the time when the proceedings were rendered abortive or the new trial was ordered). 
(2) No amount shall be paid from the Fund under this section to: 
(a) the Crown, 
(b) a corporation that has a paid-up share capital of two hundred thousand dollars or more, or 
(c) a corporation that does not have such a paid-up share capital but that, within the meaning of section 50 of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth, is related to a body corporate that has such a paid-up share capital, unless the proceedings were rendered abortive or the new trial was ordered (as referred to in subsection (1)) before the commencement of the Legal Assistance and Suitors' Fund (Amendment) Act 1970. 


6C Payments not otherwise authorised by this Act 
(1) If: 
(a) a party to an appeal or other proceedings incurs or is liable to pay costs in the appeal or proceedings, 
(b) the party is not otherwise entitled to a payment from the Fund in respect of the costs, and 
(c) the Director-General is of the opinion that a payment from the Fund in respect of the costs, although not authorised by section 6, 6A or 6B, would be within the spirit and intent of those sections, 
the Director-General may, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, pay from the Fund to the party such amount towards the costs as is assessed by the Director-General having regard to the circumstances of the case. 
(2) A payment under this section shall not exceed $10,000."" 


101It is apparent from the terms of the sections relied on, that the circumstances which have here arisen are not such that the certificate sought may be provided. As discussed in R v Pack [1999] NSWCCA 316, the circumstances are such that the respondent may fall within the provisions of s 6C of the Act, which is concerned with circumstances where a party is not entitled to a payment from the Fund, but where the costs in question would be within the spirit and intent of ss 6, 6A or 6B of the Suitors' Fund Act . At [10] the Court there observed: 
""This Court can make no order under s 6C of the Suitors Fund Act but in our opinion there is merit in the submission that a payment from the Fund would be within the spirit and intent behind s 6A(1)(c) of the Suitors Fund Act ."" 

102There may also be merit in the view in this case that a payment from the Fund would be within the spirit and intent of the legislation, in the circumstances which have arisen. That is not a matter on which this Bench is called on to express a conclusion (see R v Lilley [2000] NSWCCA 57; (2000) 111 A Crim R 468 at [34] - [37]; R v Gilfillan [2003] NSWCCA 102; (2003) 139 A Crim R 460 at [87] - [92]; Boreland v Docker (No 2) [2007] NSWCA 275 at [27]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Moradian [2010] NSWCCA 27 at [9]). A certificate under the Act must be refused. The Court has no power in the circumstances which have arisen to order that the respondent be granted a certificate. 

Orders 

103I would order that the appeal be dismissed.

		23 May 2011",2011-05-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757023,Youssef v R [2011] NSWCCA 104,"Judgment 

1Simpson J: I agree with Davies J. 

2Davies J : The Applicant pleaded guilty to the charge of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years and/or 5000 penalty units. 

3He was sentenced by Judge Hock in the District Court to a term of imprisonment for 7 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 8 months to date from 4 June 2009, the date of the offence and his arrest, and with the non-parole period expiring of 3 February 2014. 

4The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. 

5The facts as summarised by the Sentencing Judge are these. 

6On 18 May 2009 the Applicant attended Flight Centre Parramatta where he booked a Thai Airways flight from Sydney to Bangkok. He was alone and paid in cash for the flight. On 20 May 2009 the Applicant departed Australia on a Thai Airways flight to Bangkok, Thailand. 

7At about 12.35pm on 4 June 2009, the Applicant returned to Australia arriving at Sydney on a Thai Airways flight. He collected his luggage from the arrivals baggage carousel and joined a queue for Customs and Quarantine baggage inspection. He was approached by Customs officers and selected for a full baggage examination. During the baggage examination process, the Applicant was frisk-searched. At the conclusion of this search, he was asked to take off his shoes. The Applicant then told the officer that he had drugs inside his shoes. He was cautioned and taken to an interview room. A short time later AFP members attended and spoke with the Applicant. He was arrested and cautioned in relation to the matter. He was informed he would be searched and was requested to take off his shoes. Each shoe had a package wrapped in tape and other material in place of an inner sole. A presumptive test indicated a positive reaction to heroin. 

8The Applicant was conveyed to the Australian Federal Police Sydney Office where he declined to answer any questions in relation to the heroin found in his shoes. He was then charged. 

9At a later date, a forensic examination determined that the drugs inside the shoes had a total bulk weight of 1,089.7 grams. Later analysis confirmed the substance to be heroin and ascertained the purity of the heroin in each of the two samples to be 52.4 and 52.9 per cent. The total pure weight of heroin imported was 573.6 grams. Based on the calculated pure weight, the AFP estimate that the street value of the heroin imported by the Applicant was between $669,000 and $1,147,000. 

10The range of the marketable quantity for heroin is more than 2 grams up to 1.5 kilograms. Thus this quantity was more than 280 times the threshold and not at a low level for the marketable quantity. 

11The evidence establishes that the Applicant was a courier. However, he left Australia for the express purpose of bringing heroin back into this country. 

The Applicant 

12The Applicant was born in Iraq, came to Australia in 1997 as a refugee. He had, however, a daughter in Iran. In 2007 he decided that his daughter should come to Australia because of difficulties she was experiencing and he borrowed money from a friend to travel and bring her here. Ultimately, he could not repay the $10,000 so he borrowed from other people to repay it. These people were the people who recruited him to import the heroin, and he claimed they threatened to shoot him if he did not repay the money. 

13The Applicant was 41 years old. He had no prior convictions but had previously been dealt with under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for an assault matter in 2008. 

14He had suffered a serious motorbike accident when he was 18 years of age which had resulted in permanent back and leg problems, and he continued to suffer chronic pain and anxiety as a result of his injuries. Her Honour found, however, that there was no evidence that those matters would make imprisonment more onerous for him. 

15Her Honour had before her, and considered, a report from Dr Keith Dawes, a psychologist. Dr Dawes related that at some time before he came to Australia the Applicant returned to Baghdad from Tehran where he had grown up, with 2 friends. Those friends were shot dead by Iraqi police in front of him, and the Applicant believed that he was not shot because the police thought he was a Irani national. Dr Dawes concluded that he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder as a result of that incident. Dr Dawes said that when he was threatened to be shot by the people who organised his drug importation trip he would have become exceedingly anxious because it would have brought vivid recollections of what had happened when his 2 friends were shot in Iraq. Dr Dawes says that this would have resulted in a diminution of his cognitive abilities when faced with the threat to shoot him. Dr Dawes also considered that the Applicant suffered from ""Refugee Disorder"". 

Remarks on Sentence 

16Her Honour set out all of the matters I have detailed above. When she referred to the report of Dr Dawes she noted that he had said the effect of the witnessing of the shooting of his friends was such that he was more vulnerable to the threat of being shot made by the people who recruited him. Her Honour noted that even from the Applicant's own evidence he was going to make further money after clearing the $10,000 owed to the people who were threatening him. 

17Her Honour found that the Applicant would be unlikely to re-offend on his release. She took into account the plea of guilty entered in the Local Court and, when that was combined with a further reduction for assistance, her Honour reduced the overall sentence by 30%. Her Honour then imposed the sentence now sought to be appealed. 

Applicant's submissions 

18The principal submission made by the Applicant was that her Honour's starting point, which must have been a sentence of approximately 11 years, was too high a point to reflect the criminality of the Applicant, and was consistent with sentences for an offence under s 307.1 for importing a commercial quantity. 

19The Applicant also submitted that the amount of the drug is but one of the features to be taken into account when assessing the appropriate criminality. This, it was submitted, is because the weight of the drug is reflected in the maximum sentence for each category of the offences of importation. 

Consideration 

20In R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238 at [72] Johnson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and RA Hulme J agreed) set out general sentencing principles concerning serious federal drug offences. 

21It is not necessary to set out those principles again - it is sufficient to note some which are applicable to the present matter. First, although the weight of the drug imported is not the principal factor to be considered when fixing sentence, the size of the importation is a relevant factor and has increased significance when the offender is aware of the amount of drugs imported. Secondly, the amount of the drug involved is a highly relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. 

22Thirdly, involvement at any level in a drug importation offence must necessarily attract a significant sentence, otherwise the interests of general deterrence are not served. Fourthly, the prior good character of a person involved in a drug importation offence is generally to be given less weight as a mitigating factor on sentence. 

23The Court said also that the range of sentences referred to in the decision of this Court in R v Wong and Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340 remain useful to sentencing for offences of this type. However, a differently constituted Court of Criminal Appeal 6 days later in R v Cheung and Choi [2010] NSWCCA 244 said this (Simpson J with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Buddin J agreed): 

[90] In the light of the criticisms made by the High Court, I am unable to see how the selected sentences can stand as ""a useful guide"". With respect to those who have thought otherwise, I have come to the view that the proposition that the Wong and Leung guideline sentences continue to operate as ""a useful guide"" cannot withstand scrutiny. 

[91] I would therefore reject the Crown's submissions that the sentences propounded in Wong and Leung provide, even with appropriate modifications, in recognition of pleas of guilty, and the repeal of s 16G, any guidance in sentencing under s 305.3. 

24With great respect to those constituting the Court in R v Nguyen; R v Pham , a reading of the majority judgment in the High Court in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 justifies the view of the Court in R v Cheung and Choi. The better course, which I have followed, is to have regard to the cases collected by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194. 

25An examination of the cases that may be regarded as most analogous to the present case amongst those collected by McClellan CJ at CL provides no basis for the Applicant's submission that his sentence was manifestly excessive. Most of these have been usefully summarised by Kirby J (with whom Beazley JA and Johnson J agreed) in Regina v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 169 at [74] as follows: 

R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315

Plea of guilty. 
1.689 g cocaine. 
Female courier. 
Family in Malaysia - isolation, limited education. 
Sentenced to 8 years imprisonment, with NPP 4.5 years. 

26R v Mokoena [2009] QCA 36 (also mentioned in De La Rosa ) is relevant. The offender in that case was 29 years of age. He was charged with importing 891.6 grams of brown powder which yielded 497.5 grams of pure heroin. He was a courier who had undertaken to import the drugs to obtain money to support his wife, children and elderly grandmother in South Africa. He was HIV Positive. He was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. The Queensland Court of Appeal dismissed his application for leave to appeal against the sentence. He pleaded guilty at the first opportunity but it was not made clear what discount he received for that plea. 

27In Nikolovska the offender pleaded guilty to importing 1.431 kilograms of pure cocaine. She was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. In the Crown appeal against the inadequacy of that sentence the Court increased the sentence to one of 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. She was found not merely to have been a courier but because her position was a controls analyst with Qantas with a security clearance giving her access to imported goods in a secure area she was regarded as being in a higher position in the chain. 

28In Tyn v R [2009] NSWCCA 146 the Applicant was sentenced for importing a marketable quantity of heroin being 332 grams of powder containing 242.3 grams of pure heroin. She was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. She was recruited in Australia to travel to Vietnam and return carrying the heroin. She received a discount of 25% in recognition of her plea of guilty and a further reduction of 33% in recognition of cooperation with the authorities. The notional starting point of 12 years (the sole ground of appeal said that that starting point was manifestly excessive) was held not to be outside the Judge's sentencing discretion although at the top of the available range. 

29It can be seen in particular from De La Rosa (notional starting point of 10 & 2/3 years), Pham (notional starting point of 10 & 2/3 years), Le (notional starting point of 10 years), Teehan (notional starting point of 13.6 years) and Tyn that the notional starting point of 11 years in the present case was within the range of appropriate sentences. 

30The Court in SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19 and in Rutkowskyj v R [2008] NSWCCA 10 has held that the focus in a sentence appeal must be the sentence actually imposed rather than the notional starting point. If that is the correct approach (see the comment on this in Tyn at [34]), it can be seen from the various cases referred to above that a non-parole period of 4 years and 8 months itself was well within the range of sentencing discretion. 
31In relation to the further submission of the Applicant that the amount of the drug was but one of the features to be taken into account when assessing criminality, the sentencing judge acknowledged that principle by saying: 

The quantity of the drug imported is one of the many factors to be taken into account on sentence. 

Conclusion 

32In my opinion, it has not been shown that sentence was manifestly excessive. I propose the following orders: 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 

(2) The appeal is dismissed. 

33Grove AJ : I have read in draft form the judgment of Davies J and I agree with the orders which he proposes. 

34In his Honour's reasons he draws attention to the contrasting views about the continued utility of the range of sentences specified in R v Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 (in the light of the appeal in that case to the High Court) expressed by differently constituted benches of this Court in R v Nguyen & Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238 and R v Cheung & Choi [2010] NSWCCA 244 respectively. This contrast was not the subject of argument in the current appeal nor were submissions made on the point. It is not necessary to resolve the apparent difference of view to dispose of this appeal and I would not, as Davies J has, express a preference for one of them. I consider any resolution should await an instance where it is necessary so to do and the Court receives appropriate submissions in that regard.

		23 May 2011",2011-05-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757024,R v Ganene COULTER [2011] NSWSC 1176,"SENTENCE 

1The offender, Ganene Coulter, pleaded guilty on 9 May 2011 to conspiracy to murder. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The standard non-parole period does not strictly apply in this case. The plea was entered on the basis of a statement of agreed facts, part of exhibit A, and an undertaking by the offender to give evidence in the forthcoming trial of her mother and sister on the charge of murder, exhibit B. 

2The offender's evidence on the sentencing proceedings on 11 May departed in some significant respects from the contents of a record of interview on 13 April 2011, however, the undertaking recorded the fact that the offender's evidence at trial would be in accordance with the evidence she gave on 11 May. The statement of facts recorded the following: The victim, Jeffrey Ryan, and his wife Helen Ryan, the offender's older sister, were joint owners of a property in the Tamworth area consisting of 1200 acres and valued in excess of $1 million. The victim and Helen Ryan have a daughter CR, then aged 14 years. In late 2008, the relationship between Helen Ryan and the victim deteriorated to the point where a solicitor was instructed by the victim following a separation in February of 2009. 

3In May 2009, Helen Ryan attempted to transfer approximately $25,000 from the joint account into the account of CR. The transfer was prevented by the victim who then ensured that any money taken from the joint account required both signatures. Helen Ryan opened her own bank account shortly thereafter. As part of the settlement of the joint property, Helen Ryan sought $1 million and 50 per cent of the assets. The victim made a counter offer of 30 per cent which was rejected by Helen Ryan. 

4On 11 September 2009, the victim allegedly assaulted CR. The assault was reported by CR to a school counsellor and to the police. An apprehended violence order was then taken out against the victim. The return date for the order was 29 September 2009. A further interim order was granted to 12 October 2009. As a result of the AVO, the victim moved to live in a shipping container on the property, approximately 460 metres from the main homestead. Very few people knew that the victim was living in the container. 

5On 28 September 2009, the victim changed his will to remove Helen Ryan as a beneficiary. She became aware of this change when she opened his mail at the local post office. 

6In the months before 23 October 2009, Helen Ryan and the offender had a conversation by phone wherein Helen Ryan asked the offender if she knew of anyone who could have the victim murdered. The offender contacted Ian Carroll also known as ""Sharkey"", and said, ""Helen just rang me. She asked me - she needed - she needs help to get rid of this bugger."" As a result of the phone call, Carroll had a conversation with Helen Ryan and decided that he would provide Ms Ryan with a phone number of one Kenneth Brooks. Carroll later maintained to police that he believed that Brooks might be required to assault the victim, but was not aware that Brooks would be asked to murder the victim. 

7Helen Ryan made contact with Brooks and agreed on a fee of $30,000 for the murder of the victim. Half of the amount was to be paid before the murder and the remainder afterwards. On 16 September 2009, $500 was withdrawn from Helen Ryan's account followed by a cash deposit of $500 into the account in the name of the partner of Mr Brooks. Mr Brooks was to use this money to travel to Tamworth to meet with Helen Ryan before the murder. 

8Shortly thereafter, Mr Brooks met Helen Ryan at the Apex Motel in Tamworth where they further discussed the murder of the victim. Helen Ryan provided Mr Brooks with some photos of the victim. On 28 September 2009, Helen Ryan withdrew $1,000 from her account. On the same day, she withdrew a further $4,000 from an account in the name of her daughter CR. Also on that day, the offender's mother, Coralie Coulter, withdrew $10,000 from her account. The total amount of 15,000 was to be paid to Brooks for the murder of the victim. 

9On 1 October 2009, the offender withdrew $100 from her account and deposited $100 to the account of Helen Ryan. The offender was aware that the purpose of this deposit was to pay for Helen Ryan's travel expenses to meet Mr Brooks in order to pay him $15,000. 

10Between 1 October and 23 October 2009, Helen Ryan and Coralie Coulter travelled together in Helen Ryan's vehicle to a park in Murrurundi. On arrival, Coralie Coulter hid in the back passenger's seat of the vehicle whilst Helen Ryan approached Mr Brooks and gave him $15,000 as down payment for the murder. Mr Brooks told Ms Ryan that he or someone else would contact her after the murder in order to arrange payment of the remaining $15,000. According to what was said by Ms Ryan, Mr Brooks told her that she would probably never see him again. 

11On 23 October 2009, Mr Brooks rang Ms Ryan and told her it was going to happen that night. Mr Brooks rang Ms Ryan eight times between 8.05pm and 8.08pm to ascertain the location of the victim on the property. Telephone calls indicate that Mr Brooks was in the Tamworth area on October 22 and 23. No calls were made on or received on Mr Brooks' phone on 23 October between 8.08pm and 9.49pm. 

12The victim was shot and killed on 23 October 2009 between 8.40pm and 9.49pm. The victim was found lying face down wearing a T-shirt, shorts and slippers. At least two shots were fired from a shotgun. There was shotgun pellet damage to the western side of a shed about 10 metres south east of the victim. The murder weapon has not been found. 

13There were shotgun injuries to the chest and abdomen including wounds to a number of organs. The position of the injuries indicated that the shot was fired from behind the deceased and slightly to his right. 

14At 9.49pm, Mr Brooks called Ms Ryan on the victim's work phone to tell her that Mr Ryan had been killed and to get rid of her phones. It appears from the mobile phone records, that Mr Brooks returned to Cessnock where he lived, some time after 9.49pm. The offender's mobile phone which was registered in the name of Naomi Watson of Yamba, was used to call Helen Ryan on her husband's work phone at about 8pm, 8.15pm and on several occasions until shortly after 11.30pm on 23 October 2010. 

15On the night of 23 October 2009, only Helen Ryan and her daughter were at the main residence on the property. Helen Ryan told police that the victim was there on the evening of the 23rd from about 7.30pm until 8.15pm. CR told police that she did not see the victim that day, but heard him talking to her mother at the house while she was in her room. CR thought that the victim left at about 8pm. 

16The victim's body was discovered by a neighbour on Saturday, 24 October at about 11am. The neighbour rang 000. A short time later, Helen Ryan arrived in a vehicle driven by the offender. CR was also present. 

17On 21 December 2009, Mr Carroll assisted the police by calling the offender in order to ask her questions about the murder of the victim. The call was recorded. The offender told Mr Carroll that her sister had paid Mr Brooks an amount of money being ""fifteen"". As a result of this conversation, police used the services of an undercover operative who met with the offender on 11 January 2010 in Grafton. During this conversation, the offender made numerous admissions in relation to her role and the role of others in the murder of the victim. The offender told the undercover operative that Ms Ryan had paid Mr Brooks $15,000 and that her mother had paid $10,000 of that amount to assist Helen Ryan to pay for the victim's murder in the knowledge that the money was to be used for that purpose. 

18This aspect of the facts is not supported by the offender's evidence on 11 May 2011. It appears that the offender is now maintaining that her mother was not told of the purpose of the $10,000 payment until after the murder had taken place. 

19The offender admitted to placing money into Ms Ryan's account to assist her in meeting Mr Brooks in order to pay him the $15,000. The offender also admitted to arranging for the destruction of the mobile phones used by herself and Ms Ryan. 

20A meeting took place on 18 January 2010 between the undercover operative, Helen Ryan, Coralie Coulter and the offender. The offender made further admissions of her part in the murder of the victim. 

21The offender was arrested on 11 February 2010 and has remained in custody since that date. 

22The objective seriousness of an offence of conspiracy to murder is to be assessed against the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. This Court has previously remarked when dealing with the offence of solicit to murder that: 

""[It] is a fundamentally abhorrent and heinous crime. It is a crime for which the sentence must reflect a significant element of personal and general deterrence. Deterrence has a particular relevance by reason of the cold blooded motivation that lies behind the act of an offender in engaging or attempting to engage a hit man to kill another for reward. It also has a particular relevance in that part of the motivation in contracting the job out to a professional is to reduce the chances of detection not only because that person is assumed to have special skills, but also because the offender is able to place himself or herself one step removed from the killing."" (See R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136 at [55] - [56]). 

23Both the Crown and the offender's counsel submitted that the fact of the victim's death in this case objectively qualified the offence as one in the upper range of criminality. That submission is, no doubt, correct when one has regard to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence. However, the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence for the purposes of sentencing this offender must take into account the role the offender played in the commission of the offence relative to her co-offenders. That principle has been recognised on a number of occasions by this Court with respect to the commission of drug offences. (See R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78). It applies equally to offences committed jointly by a number of offenders. 

24The offender's role in the commission of the offence was not insignificant, although it is questionable whether it could be described as critical. The offender provided the contact whereby Ms Ryan was able to secure the services of a hit man knowing that her sister's intention was to kill her husband. It appears that Ms Ryan requested the contact from the offender on the basis that the offender had spent an earlier period of her life engaged in prostitution and had thereby associated with men such as Mr Carroll. 

25According to the offender's evidence, Mr Carroll, a truck driver, supplied the offender with amphetamines and took a percentage of her earnings on the occasions that he procured other truck drivers as clients of the offender. It is not possible to determine whether, had the offender refused to assist Ms Ryan, Ms Ryan would have been able to turn elsewhere. The advantage to Ms Ryan of engaging the offender in the enterprise was an assurance that the offender would not reveal the details of the offence out of a sense of family loyalty. Moreover, the evidence of the offender suggests that there was a degree of influence exerted by Ms Ryan over the offender in so far as the offender was the second youngest of six children of whom Ms Ryan was the second eldest. 

26Ms Ryan is approximately 10 years older than the offender. The offender's history of prostitution and drug taking made her somewhat vulnerable to the demands of an older sister. According to the offender's evidence, Ms Ryan had asked the offender to make notes in relation to drug use in order to authenticate a version of events that suggests that the victim was killed because of a drug debt. 

27In the result that sense of family loyalty has not been sufficient to prevent the offender from confessing her part in the offence or from disclosing her mother's and her sister's conduct. Nonetheless, the offender was a mature woman of 40 years of age in a stable relationship when she complied with her sister's request. Not only was the victim her brother-in-law, but the offender herself had been in a short relationship with the victim, prior to Ms Ryan meeting him. 

28The offender could not satisfactorily explain why she carried out Ms Ryan's request seemingly without hesitation. To the extent that the offender said that she saw photos of Ms Ryan with bruises, cuts and swelling to her body that Ms Ryan claimed had been inflicted by the victim, violence of that kind can never justify exacting revenge by the taking of a human life. The same must also be said of the apparently false allegations made by Ms Ryan to the offender that the victim had sexually assaulted CR. 

29Taking these matters into account, the offence committed by the offender is objectively very grave. On the spectrum constituted by the maximum penalty for the offence, her criminality lies towards the upper range. It remains to factor in the subjective circumstances of the offender in order to arrive at a sentence which properly reflects the combination of these factors. 
30The offender is presently 42 years of age. She grew up in a loving and caring family environment attending school in MacLean. She left school at 15 years of age, worked in a restaurant for a period of 14 months and ceased work when she fell pregnant. Her first child was born in 1987 when the offender was 18. At that point, the offender was living with the father of that child. Another child was born to the relationship in 1988 however, the offender's partner left her about 2 or 3 years later. 

31In 1987, the offender's father died of cancer at the age of 48. The offender was deeply affected by her father's death. The offender had many short-term relationships over the following years including one with a truck driver for a period of 6 months. The offender met Mr Carroll, who she knew as ""Sharkey"", in the course of this relationship. This partner was violent towards her until Mr Carroll stepped in and put an end to the violence and to the relationship. Mr Carroll became a good friend to the offender. 

32For a period of 2 to 3 years, the offender work at an escort service in Coffs Harbour and Inverell. She ceased that work in about 1997. 

33The offender was using amphetamines and cannabis when she met Mr Carroll. The offender described the use of amphetamines as an adjunct to her work in so far as it allowed her to stay awake for lengthy periods of time. Her drug use generally facilitated her work and dulled the emotional and physical pain arising from it. 

34At some point, the offender stopped using amphetamines but continued to use cannabis up to her arrest. The offender's use has consisted of approximately 20 cones per day for almost 20 years. The offender's memory has also been affected by her long term drug use. 

35The offender has been in a stable relationship for the past 11 years. At the time of her arrest the offender was receiving a carer's pension. 
36I accept that the offender is genuinely remorseful for her role in the commission of the offence. The offender said that she was ""horrified and shattered"" about what she had done and that she felt terrible that the victim's death has deprived her niece of a father. The offender stated a number of times that she was still asking herself why she became involved, particularly when there was no financial benefit offered to her and no advantage beyond the observance of sibling loyalty. 

37Whatever sympathy the offender felt for Ms Ryan has been undermined by Ms Ryan's conduct since the arrest of the offender. On reading Ms Ryan's record of interview, it appeared to the offender that her sister had ""stabbed her in the back."" 

38The offender has a conviction for goods in custody in 2005. To the extent that she has no convictions for offences of violence, the offender is relevantly of good character for the purposes of this sentencing exercise. It is likely she will forever be alienated from her family because of the stance she has taken against her sister and her mother. Given the context of the offence and the fact that the offender is effectively estranged from her family, her prospects of reoffending a exceedingly low. 

39The plea of guilty was effectively entered on the eve of the trial, however, it was indicated to the Crown approximately one month before the trial date that the offender may be willing to assist the prosecution and it was in that context that the plea negotiations commenced in earnest. The utilitarian value of the plea in these circumstances is not significant. A discount of 10 per cent for the plea of guilty is appropriate. 

40The quantification of the discount for the offender's future assistance is problematic. The offender's evidence on 11 May is at odds with the evidence of the undercover police officer in a significant respect, that is, as I have already noted, the offender maintains there was no conversation with her mother wherein her mother disclosed knowledge of the plan to murder the victim before it occurred. 

41The agreed facts make it abundantly clear that the offender told the undercover police officer that her mother well knew of the purpose for the payment of $15,000 to Mr Brooks. How this conflict will be resolved is a matter for the jury in the trial of Ms Ryan and Coralie Coulter. The conflict suggests that the offender's assistance is not as forthcoming as the Crown anticipated. It clearly does not strengthen the Crown case against Coralie Coulter. Rather, the offender's evidence is capable of weakening it. The offender's assistance will strengthen the Crown case against Ms Ryan. I accept her evidence is valuable in that regard. 

42In these circumstances, I assess the offender's future assistance at 20 per cent. There ought to be no component for past assistance given that the offender did not contribute to the investigation of the offence by way of assistance to the authorities. 

43In my view, a sentence of 16 years is appropriate to reflect the offender's objective and subjective circumstances. Applying a discount of 30 per cent, I would impose a sentence of 11 years and 2 months. A finding of special circumstances is warranted on the basis that it is likely the offender will experience threats from those associated with members of her family, Mr Carroll and Mr Brooks. Her access to programmes within the prison system has already been restricted for these reasons because the hostility expressed towards her has resulted in placement in a form of protection. 

44However, the requirement that the non-parole period reflect the objective gravity of the offence dictates no more than a slight moderation of the statutory ratio. 

45Ganene Coulter, would you please stand. On the charge of conspiracy to murder you are convicted. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months to date from 11 February 2010 expiring 10 August 2017. I fix a balance of term expiring 10 April 2021. You are therefore eligible for release to parole on 11 August 2017.

		06 October 2011",2011-05-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757040,Agius v R; Abibadra v R; Jandagi v R; Zerafa v R [2011] NSWCCA 119,"Judgment 

1TOBIAS AJA : I agree with Johnson J. 

2JOHNSON J : These are applications for leave to appeal under s.5F(3)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by four persons who are to stand trial in the Supreme Court of New South Wales for alleged tax conspiracy offences. 

3Each of the Applicants (Robert Francis Agius, Carol Abibadra, Deborah Judith Jandagi and Kevin Zerafa) has been arraigned on an indictment containing two counts of conspiracy, described in the following terms: 

""1. Between about 1 January 1997 and about 23 May 2001 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and with Owen Trevor DANIEL to defraud the Commonwealth. 

Contrary to section 86(1) and section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). (Law Part Code 11102). 

2. Between about 24 May 2001 and about 10 April 2008 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and with Owen Trevor DANIEL to dishonestly cause a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss, to a third person, namely the Commonwealth, knowing or believing that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring. 

Contrary to section 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code . (Law Part Code 41506)."" 

4Each of the Applicants applied to the trial Judge, Simpson J, in advance of trial for certain interlocutory orders. On 4 May 2011, Simpson J gave reasons for refusing the applications of the Applicants: R v Agius; R v Abibadra; R v Jandagi; R v Zerafa [2011] NSWSC 367. 

5In particular, her Honour refused the application for a permanent stay of the second count in the indictment. 

6On 6 May 2011, each of the Applicants filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal Against an Interlocutory Order for the purpose of s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 contending that her Honour had erred in declining to permanently stay the second count in the indictment, and seeking that this Court make such an order. 

7The applications for leave to appeal were brought before this Court as a matter of urgency and proceeded to hearing on 13 May 2011. Although a jury panel has yet to be assembled for the purposes of the trial, this Court was informed that it was the desire of the trial Judge to commence the trial within the next few weeks. 

Applications for Leave to Appeal 

8This Court was informed that the trial Judge had not been requested, for the purposes of s.5F(3)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 , to certify that the judgment or order in this case was a proper one for determination on appeal. If her Honour had so certified, then the matters would proceed by way of appeal in this Court without the need for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave to appeal: R v Petroulias [2007] NSWCCA 134; 73 NSWLR 134 at 136 [8]. 

9Accordingly, it falls to this Court to determine whether the Applicants should have leave to appeal from Simpson J's refusal to permanently stay the second count on the indictment. 

10This Court has said that leave will only be granted where the decision which is the subject of the s.5F application is attended with sufficient doubt so as to warrant the matter being argued on appeal ( R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 644-645), or where the interests of justice otherwise require the intervention of the Court at this stage of the proceedings ( R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 723; R v Dinh [2000] NSWCCA 536; 120 A Crim R 42 at 48 [34]). The Court should bear in mind the undesirability of interrupting criminal proceedings by the bringing of a s.5F application: R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31 at 37 [23]-[25]. 

11It is clear that the refusal of an application for a permanent stay falls within the meaning of the words ""interlocutory judgment or order"" in s.5F: R v King [2003] NSWCCA 399; 59 NSWLR 472 at 477 [22]. 

12If this Court refused the Applicants leave to appeal under s.5F, the refusal would not preclude any other appeal following conviction on the matter to which the refused applications related: s.5F(6). At times, this Court will refuse leave to appeal under s.5F because the issues sought to be advanced on appeal involve matters which may properly be left to consideration on appeal after trial if a conviction results. 

13Although this Court is asked to proceed on the present applications upon a very limited documentary foundation, the Court was urged to grant leave to appeal and to consider and determine the appeals on their merits. It was submitted for the Applicants that this course was appropriate given the significant impact upon the length of the trial should a permanent stay of the second count be granted. It was also submitted that an important question was raised involving the proper construction and application of provisions in the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (""the Code""), and that similar issues are involved in a number of other pending prosecutions for alleged tax conspiracy. It was submitted that it was important to the progress of the present prosecutions and other pending prosecutions that this Court grant leave and proceed to hear and determine the appeals on their merits. 

14The Crown did not seek to challenge these assertions and did not oppose a grant of leave to appeal in these cases. 
 
The Claim of Abuse of Process - The Second Count is Foredoomed to Fail 

15The principles concerning abuse of process to be applied on an application such as this are not in doubt. 

16It has been emphasised that the power to stay permanently a criminal prosecution will be used only in most exceptional circumstances: Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 at 31. The onus of satisfying the Court that there is an abuse of process lies upon the party alleging it and the onus is a heavy one: Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; 174 CLR 509 at 529. 

17Although the jurisdiction to stay proceedings as an abuse of process is wide ranging, it is not without limits. It has been said that the discretion cannot be exercised to stop proceedings because the evidence against an accused person is weak or because (if it be the case) the Bench disapproves of the prosecution: R v Chairman, County of London Court of Sessions; Ex parte Downes [1954] 1 QB 1 at 6; R v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788; 177 A Crim R 153 at 174 [63]. 

18The Applicants submit that the second count should be permanently stayed on the basis that it is foredoomed to fail: Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; 177 CLR 378 at 393, 411. To succeed in an application for a permanent stay on this basis, it is necessary for the Applicants to show that the proceedings ""can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail"" ( Walton v Gardiner at 393 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) or that they will ""inevitably and manifestly fail"" ( Walton v Gardiner at 411 per Brennan J). 

19Although these statements in Walton v Gardiner were made in the context of a medical disciplinary case, this formulation of the principles of abuse of process has been applied where a permanent stay is sought with respect to the trial of offences being prosecuted on indictment: R v Jasper [2003] NSWCCA 186; 139 A Crim R 329 at 335 [18], R v Petroulias (No. 1) at 164-165 [26], 173-179 [55]-[85]. If the application succeeds, the operation of the criminal justice system will not proceed further with respect to the second count. There will be no trial at which the trial Judge may be called upon to determine whether the Applicants have a case to answer, applying the principles in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207. All of this underlines the exceptional nature of the remedy which the Applicants seek. 

20The question here is whether the Applicants have demonstrated error on the part of Simpson J and established an entitlement to the exceptional remedy of a permanent stay of the second count upon the basis that it is foredoomed to fail. 

The Present Applications 

21Limited documentation was placed before this Court at the hearing of the present applications. Apart from written submissions relied upon before Simpson J and in this Court, the Court was taken to the indictment (see [3] above) and a document entitled ""Particulars of Conspiracy and Overt Acts"" relied upon by the Crown. 

22Some factual background may be derived from Simpson J's judgment at [5]-[6] (the Crown is described as the ""CDPP"" ): 

""5 Notwithstanding that the indictment alleges two counts of conspiracy against each accused, what the CDPP in fact alleges is a single conspiracy, extending over the whole of the time frame specified in the two charges - that is, from 1 January 1997 to 10 April 2008. Particulars of the allegation that have been provided to the accused explain the nature of the conspiracy, and the fraud, alleged. From those particulars the following may be derived. The CDPP alleges: 
 
* Mr Agius was an expatriate Australian accountant practising in Vanuatu; 

* Mr Daniel (now deceased) was an accountant and principal of an accountancy firm by the name of 'Owen T Daniel & Co Burwood' ('OTD'); 

* Mr Zerafa and Ms Jandagi were accountants employed by or working at OTD; 

* Ms Abibadra, while not formally qualified as an accountant, worked as such at OTD; 

(Mr Zerafa, Ms Jandagi and Ms Abibadra were referred to as 'the OTD accused'.) 

* sometime in early 1997 Mr Agius and Mr Daniel made an agreement to defraud the Commonwealth by depriving it of income tax legitimately due to it by various corporate clients of OTD; 

* put simply, they did this by a scheme that involved, first, falsely inflating the legitimately tax deductible expenses of the companies involved, thus dishonestly reducing the income tax that would be found to be payable, and, second, by concealing or disguising income of the companies as loans, again reducing the amount of income tax that would be found to be payable. 

6 It is the CDPP's case that the scheme was always a scheme to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue due to it by way of taxation, and that it continued to operate in essentially the way described throughout the period of the conspiracy. The sole reason for bringing two counts against each accused lies in a radical change in the legislative regime governing offences concerning 'the proper administration of government' that was introduced into the Criminal Code with effect from 24 May 2001. There has at all relevant times existed a statutory provision creating an offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, although it has been expressed in different ways. The change in the language of the legislation explains the change in the language in which the two charges are expressed. It is important to emphasise that what the CDPP alleges is a continuing course of conduct beginning with the agreement in early 1997 and its progressive implementation thereafter, until it came to an end in April 2008."" 

23According to paragraph 6 of the document entitled ""Particulars of Conspiracy and Overt Acts"" , the Crown contends that an agreement to defraud the Commissioner of Taxation of tax revenue was formed in Sydney between about 1 January 1997 and 1 May 1997, with the original parties to the agreement being at least the Applicant Agius and Owen Trevor Daniel (now deceased). It is the Crown case that the Applicant Abibadra joined the conspiracy by 13 May 1997, the Applicant Jandagi joined the conspiracy by the end of 1998 and the Applicant Zerafa joined the conspiracy by the end of 2000. 

24Put shortly, the Applicants submitted before Simpson J that Count 2 was foredoomed to fail because: 

(a) the Crown contended that each of the Applicants had entered into an agreement for the purpose of the conspiracy by 31 December 2000 at the latest, and certainly well before 24 May 2001, the commencement date for the conspiracy alleged in the second count; 

(b) the evidence relied upon by the Crown with respect to the agreement pointed to the entering into an agreement before 23 May 2001 and there was no evidence at all that any of the Applicants entered into or joined an agreement on or after 24 May 2001; 

(c) in these circumstances, what was said to be the actus reus of conspiracy, namely entering into an agreement, did not occur in the period on or after 24 May 2001, the period specified for the offence contained in the second count, being an offence under s.135.4 of the Code; 

(d) no transitional provision in the Code or other legislation assisted the Crown to allow an offence to be charged in the manner contained in the second count. 

Relevant Statutory Provisions 

25Simpson J set out the relevant statutory provisions (apart from transitional provisions) at [8]-[17] of her Honour's judgment. This summary was not challenged before this Court and it is convenient to incorporate it in this judgment: 

""8 Immediately prior to 24 May 2001 and as at 1 January 1997, the relevant legislation was s 29D and s 86(1) of the Crimes Act . Those sections then provided as follows: 

'29D Fraud 

A person who defrauds the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence. 

Penalty: ... imprisonment for 10 years ... 

86 Conspiracy 

(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence against a law of the Commonwealth punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months ... is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed.' 

9 Section 86(1) created a general offence of conspiracy to commit an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, and prescribed the penalty. Section 86(2) specified a more severe penalty where the law of the Commonwealth against which the accused conspired to commit an offence was s 29D. It is worth noting that s 86(2) did not, by itself or in conjunction with any other provision, create an offence. It is merely a provision with respect to penalty - that is, with respect to the penalty applicable to an offence created by s 86(1) in combination with s 29D. 

10 Sub-section (3) of s 86 spelled out essential conditions for the conviction of an accused person under s 86. Those conditions were stated as: 

'(a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and 

(b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and 

(c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement.' 

I pause to note that the Crimes Act did not contain a definition of the offence of conspiracy. 

11 On 15 March 1995 the Criminal Code Act 1995 received Royal Assent. It was proclaimed to commence on 1 January 1997. By s 3 of the Criminal Code Act , the Schedule thereto took effect as the Criminal Code ('the Code'). The Code contained various provisions codifying certain offences against Commonwealth law. Notably absent from the Code at that time were any provisions concerning conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. The Code did contain, however, in s 11.5, provisions concerning conspiracy to commit offences against Commonwealth law. That did not affect the continued operation of s 86(2), s 86(3) and s 29D of the Crimes Act . 

12 The Code introduced quite novel terminology into the statutory expression of criminal law. All of its linguistic features that need here be noted concern the approach to the long entrenched notions that (in general) criminal culpability depended upon proof, by the prosecution, of both a physical act constituting the crime (formerly known as 'the actus reus ') and an accompanying mental element (formerly known as a 'guilty mind', or ' mens rea '). 

13 By s 3.1(1) of the Code, these elements have been re-badged as 'physical elements' and 'fault elements'. By s 3.2, a person may not be found guilty of committing an offence unless the prosecution has proved: 
 
'(a) the existence of such physical elements as are, under the law creating the offence, relevant to establishing guilt; [and] 

(b) in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, one of the fault elements for the physical element.' 
 
By s 4.1(1), a physical element of an offence may be: 

'(a) conduct; or 

(b) a result of conduct; or 

(c) a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs.' 

By s 4.1(2), 'conduct' means: 

'an act, an omission to perform an act or a state of affairs.'; 

and 'engage in conduct' means: 

'(a) do an act; or 

(b) omit to perform an act.' 

14 Section 29D and s 86(2) (but not the balance of s 86) were repealed with effect from 24 May 2001. This was achieved by the enactment of the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 2005 ('the Code Amendment Act'). By the Code Amendment Act, a new Chapter 7 was inserted into the Code. 

15 Chapter 7 of the Code is headed 'The Proper Administration of Government'. Section 135.4 is to be found in Chapter 7. It relevantly provides as follows: 


' 135.4 Conspiracy to defraud 

Obtaining a gain 

... 

Causing a loss 

... 

(5) A person is guilty of an offence if: 

(a) the person conspires with another person to dishonestly cause a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss, to a third person; and 

(b) the first-mentioned person knows or believes that the loss will occur or that there is a substantial risk of the loss occurring; and 

(c) the third person is a Commonwealth entity. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years. 

... 

General provisions 

(9) For a person to be guilty of an offence against this section: 

(a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and 

(b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended to do the thing pursuant to the agreement; and 

(c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement. 

...' 

16 Thus, as and from 24 May 2001, the offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth was wholly contained (and codified) in s 135.4 of the Code. 

17 What remained of s 86 after the proclamation of the commencement of the Code Amendment Act was repealed with effect from 15 December 2001. That repeal was achieved by the enactment of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 ('the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act'). That repeal has little, if any, bearing upon the issue for present determination. However, since, on behalf of all accused, considerable reliance was placed upon one aspect of the repealing legislation, it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions, and that can conveniently be done here."" 
 
26Simpson J set out pertinent transitional provisions at [18]-[20]. Once again, it is appropriate to cite those paragraphs: 

""18 Both the Code Amendment Act and the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act necessarily contained transitional provisions. 

19 The transitional provisions of the Code Amendment Act (that is, those relating to the repeal of s 29D and s 86(2) of the Crimes Act and applicable to the pre-Code offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth) were to be found in Item 418 of Part 2 of Schedule 2, and are in the following terms: 

' 418 Transitional - pre-commencement offences 

(1) Despite the amendment or repeal of a provision by this Schedule, that provision continues to apply, after the commencement of this item, in relation to: 

(a) an offence committed before the commencement of this item; or 

(b) proceedings for an offence alleged to have been committed before the commencement of this item; or 

(c) any matter connected with, or arising out of, such proceedings; 

as if the amendment or repeal had not been made. 

(2) Subitem (1) does not limit the operation of section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.' 

20 The transitional provisions of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act (that is, those repealing the balance of s 86 of the Crimes Act and applicable to the pre-Code offence of conspiracy other than conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth) were to be found in s 4 thereof, and were in the following terms: 

'4 Application of amendments 

(1) Subject to subsection (3), each amendment made by this Act applies to acts and omissions that take place after the amendment commences. 

(2) For the purposes of this section, if an act or omission is alleged to have taken place between 2 dates, one before and one on or after the day on which a particular amendment commences, the act or omission is alleged to have taken place before the amendment commences. 

(3) ...'."" 

The Decision at First Instance 

27Simpson J recounted the relevant legislative history, including the repeal of ss.29D and 86 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in 2001 and the commencement of s.135.4 of the Code on 24 May 2001. Her Honour referred to the transitional provisions. 

28Her Honour then encapsulated the issues requiring determination in the following way (at [21]-[23]): 

""21 The proposition for which all accused argued may be stated shortly and simply. It is that, given the acknowledgement on behalf of the CDPP that the allegations against each accused involve a single conspiracy spanning the periods of operation of two legislative regimes, it is not open to the CDPP to charge two separate offences. That, in turn, depends upon a further series of simple propositions: that the essence of a conspiracy is entry into an agreement to commit a crime; that the crime of conspiracy is complete upon the relevant agreement being made; and that, in the absence of evidence of entry into an agreement after the commencement of the second legislative regime, the CDPP is unable to prove a conspiracy during the time to which that regime relates. 

22 Shortly and simply stated it may be, but the argument calls for some examination of the statutory provisions associated with the enactment of the Code, as well as some common law principles concerning the offence of conspiracy. 

23 As was the case in respect of the Crimes Act offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, 'conspiracy' is not explicitly defined in the Code. However, there are significant pointers to the meaning of the term as it is used in the Code, including in s 135.4(9). These pointers indicate that the framers of the Code intended to adopt and perpetuate the well established and well understood notion of conspiracy at common law."" 

29Her Honour set out a number of principles concerning the common law crime of conspiracy at [25]-[30], and these principles (apart from the last sentence in [30]) are not challenged by the Applicants. Her Honour said: 

""25 The essence of the offence of conspiracy is agreement. It has long been accepted that, at common law, a conspiratorial agreement is the agreement of the parties to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means: Jones (1832) 4 B & Ad 345; 110 ER 485 (cited in Gillies at p 1 and p 71). 

26 That characterisation has repeatedly been adopted. That did not change when the common law offence was given statutory recognition, or took statutory form. That, no doubt, is why the Crimes Act did not, and the Code does not, attempt a definition of conspiracy. 

27 It is that characterisation that provides the foundation for the argument advanced on behalf of the accused. 

28 It is well established that the crime of conspiracy is complete when the agreement is made: Gillies, p 16. Up to a point, that has been modified by statute, in that both s 86(3)(c) of the Crimes Act required, and s 135.4(9)(c) of the Code requires, before an accused can be convicted of the offence, proof of at least one overt act pursuant to the agreement. 

29 Notwithstanding that the crime is complete when the agreement is made, it is equally well established that conspiracy is a continuing offence: Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot [1973] AC 807 at 827. 

30 While overt acts are frequently the basis for proof of the crime of conspiracy, they themselves did not, at common law or under the Crimes Act , constitute the actus reus of the conspiracy. That remained the formation of the agreement. (As will appear below, that is not an entirely accurate formulation. More accurately, it seems to me, that actus reus was the participation in the agreement.)"" 

30After referring to The Queen v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177 and R v B [2008] NSWCCA 85; 76 NSWLR 533, her Honour said at [33]-[36]: 

""33 The substance of the submissions made on behalf of the OTD accused was encapsulated in a single sentence, as follows: 

'19. Whilst conspiracy may be described as a continuing offence, any criminal liability arising from an agreement to defraud the Commonwealth formed during the currency of s 29D of the Crimes Act could not continue after s 29D was repealed and replaced by s 135.4(5) of the Code .' 

The submission went on to refer to the transitional provisions, to which I will return. 

34 I am satisfied that the submissions are based upon a fundamental misconception. That misconception is that the offence of conspiracy depends upon the formation of, or entry into, an agreement, as distinct from the existence of, or participation in, such an agreement. The submissions were to the effect that, since the CDPP alleges that the agreement was made during the currency of s 29D of the Crimes Act, then, absent a second agreement formed, made, or entered into after the commencement of s 135.4(5) of the Code, there can be no offence of conspiracy contrary to that section. 

35 That is, as I have indicated, fundamentally wrong. What the offence of conspiracy depends upon is the existence of, or participation in, an agreement, and not the precise timing of its formation. 

36 A parallel may be found in the decision in Doot, to which reference has already been made. Put shortly, in that case the House of Lords held that a conspiracy could be found to exist, notwithstanding that there was no evidence that the necessary agreement was formed within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the offence was prosecuted"" 

31Her Honour set out extracts from the decision of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot [1973] AC 807 and then continued at [38]-[41]: 

""38 ...The analogy with the present case is obvious. If an agreement that had its origin extra-territorially can give rise to an offence within territorial jurisdiction, provided that the agreement continues in existence and there is some overt act towards its implementation committed within territorial jurisdiction, so also can an agreement that has its origin outside the temporal limits of the applicable legislation, provided that the agreement continues in existence and there is some overt act committed towards its implementation. 

39 Moreover, regard must be had to the provisions of the Code to which I have referred above. While it is true that a necessary element to the offence of conspiracy is a physical element, and the physical element upon which the CDPP relied is 'conduct', that term is given an extended definition, so as to include 'a state of affairs' (s 4.1(2)). There is no escaping the conclusion that 'a state of affairs' includes the existence (continuing) of an agreement to defraud the Commonwealth. 

40 It would be highly artificial - to an absurd degree - to suggest that an agreement that had its inception prior to the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Code, but that continued, and continued to be implemented, thereafter, could not be prosecuted under the Code because the alleged conspirators failed, on the change of legislation, to renew, or remake, their agreement. 

41 That, is, in my opinion, sufficient to dispose of the present issue."" 

32Her Honour then turned to consider submissions made with respect to the transitional provisions (at [42]-[47]), before concluding at [48]): 

""It may be correct that the offence charged is a single, continuing, offence. What calls for two separate counts is that the relevant conduct is criminalised by two different legislative regimes."" 

33Her Honour noted (at [49]-[51]) submissions advanced by the Crown which were not accepted. However, as it happened, these submissions did not bear upon the outcome of the application to permanently stay the second count. 

34Her Honour held that there was no basis to permanently stay the second count and refused the application. 

The Applicants' Grounds 

35The Applicants contend that her Honour has erred in various respects. Each of the Applicants Abibadra, Jandagi and Zerafa rely upon the following grounds: 

""1) Her Honour erred in concluding that an offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, pursuant to s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Code), could be established on the basis of an agreement that was entered into by each of the applicants before s 135.4(5) commenced operation. In particular: 

i) Her Honour erred in the application of the express statutory modifications to the common law of conspiracy brought about by section s 135.4(9) of the Code. 

ii) Consequently, her Honour misconstrued the physical element of 'conspires' in s 135.4(5) of the Code."" 

36The Applicant Agius relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

""1 The learned primary judge erred in law; 

(a) in not finding that proceedings on count 2 could not succeed and were therefore an abuse of process; 

(b) in not finding there was no evidence of an agreement as required by Criminal Code s. 135.4(9); 

(c) in not finding such evidence was necessary to sustain count 2; 

(d) in holding that although the indictment charged two separate conspiracies the Crown need prove only one agreement to obtain two convictions, one on each count; 

(e) in holding that the offence of conspiracy does not depend upon evidence of the formation of or entry into an agreement (whether the formation be proved by direct or inferential evidence). 

2. The learned primary judge erred in concluding that an offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, pursuant to s.135.4(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Code) could be established on the basis of an agreement that was entered into by each of the applicants before s 135.4(5) commenced operation. In particular: 

(a) Her Honour erred in the application of the express statutory modifications to the common law of conspiracy brought about by section s 135.4(9) of the Code. 

(b) Consequently, her Honour misconstrued the physical element of 'conspires' in s 135.4(5) of the Code."" 

Submissions of the Parties 

37In written submissions made jointly on behalf of the Applicants Abibadra, Jandagi and Zerafa, Mr Hastings QC and Messrs Jordan and Averre of counsel, submitted that her Honour had erred in concluding that an offence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth pursuant to s.135.4(5) of the Code could be established on the basis of an agreement that was entered by each of the Applicants before the offence created by that provision commenced operation. In particular, it was submitted that: 

(a) her Honour erred in concluding (at [34]-[35]), that at common law the actus reus of the offence of conspiracy was the existence of, or participation in, the agreement, whereas the actus reus was the entry into the agreement ( The Queen v LK at 205-206 [57], 207-208 [62]-[64]); 

(b) her Honour erred in the application of the express statutory modifications to the common law of conspiracy brought about by s.135.4(9) of the Code; 

(c) consequently, her Honour (at [39] and [45]) misconstrued the physical element of ""conspires"" in s.135.4(5) of the Code as being constituted by ""a state of affairs"" , when in fact the offence of conspiracy requires conduct comprising acts of entering into the agreement and the commission of an overt act. 

38These submissions were developed by reference to passages in the judgments of the High Court in The Queen v LK and other authorities. It was submitted that the principles in Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot had been overtaken by specific provisions contained in the Code. In particular, it was submitted that her Honour had not paid due regard to what was said to be the express statutory modification in s.135.4(9) which applies to conspiracy under the Code. 

39It was further submitted for these Applicants that her Honour had erred in characterising the circumstances of this case as attracting the ""state of affairs"" provision in the Code. A consequence of this, it was submitted, is that her Honour erred in the construction and application of the transitional provisions. 

40It was submitted for these Applicants that acceptance of their submissions did not have the alarming consequences suggested by the Crown. It was submitted that the Crown had sought to exploit the loose concept of conspiracy offences by alleging a course of conduct over a period in excess of 10 years, involving arrangements in which different taxpayers participated at different times and in different circumstances. It was submitted for these Applicants that, if there is evidence of significant criminal activity by the Applicants after 24 May 2001, the prosecution is entitled to charge substantive offences against the Code. 

41Mr Barker QC, for the Applicant Agius, advanced similar arguments to those for the other Applicants. He too sought to rely upon passages in the judgment of the High Court in The Queen v LK . In addition, he submitted that whilst the Crown says there was no second agreement, it maintained (inconsistently) that it can rely on s.4.1(1)(a) and (2) of the Code to satisfy the physical element required by s.135.4(9)(a), that is to say ""the person must have entered into an agreement"" . 

42Mr Barker QC submits that the offence of conspiracy requires proof of the statutory physical element of entry into an agreement (s.135.4(9)(a)) and proof of the commission of an overt act (s.135.4(9)(c)). He submits that her Honour was wrong in holding that the physical element required by s.135.4(5)(a) could be constituted by a ""state of affairs"" . He submits that the clear language of the Code must be adhered to: R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272; 175 A Crim R 108. Mr Barker QC submits that the effect of her Honour's interpretation of s.135.4(9)(a) is to give it retrospectivity before 24 May 2001 and, in his submission, this must be wrong. 

43The Crown submits that her Honour did not err in refusing to permanently stay the second count in the indictment, and developed arguments in support of this submission. 

Resolution of Competing Submissions 

44Before moving to an assessment and determination of the issues raised by the Applicants, it is of passing interest that a prosecution for a conspiracy of long duration, interrupted by statutory amendment, has occurred before this case. In R v Ronen [2006] NSWCCA 123; 161 A Crim R 30, three persons were charged with two offences of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of tax revenue. The Crown alleged that a single conspiracy was on foot from 1991 to 2001. As Howie J observed at 303 [4], there were two counts on the indictment, reflecting the fact that during the period of the conspiracy, there was a change in September 1995 to the statutory provisions prescribing the offences charged. The Appellants in that case were convicted on both counts. It does not seem that any argument had been advanced in R v Ronen that a fresh agreement, formed within the period of the second offence charged on the indictment, needed to be proved by the Crown. Of course, that case predated the commencement of relevant provisions of the Code. However, the scenario was the same as described by Simpson J in the passage cited at [32] above - the conspiracy charged was a single, continuing offence with two separate counts required as the relevant conduct was criminalised by two different legislative regimes. 

45It is useful to consider the issues posed for determination by these applications using the categories of suggested error advanced by the Applicants at [37] above, and additional areas touched upon in submissions. 

Alleged Error Concerning the Actus Reus of Conspiracy at Common Law 

46Simpson J accepted that the essence of the offence of conspiracy at common law is agreement and that it is well established that the crime of conspiracy is complete when the agreement is made. Her Honour observed that, notwithstanding that the crime is complete when the agreement is made, it is equally well established that conspiracy is a continuing offence. 

47Thus far, there is no dispute between the parties as to her Honour's description of the common law offence of conspiracy. 

48Her Honour also observed, uncontroversially, that whilst overt acts are frequently the basis for proof of the crime of conspiracy, they themselves did not at common law, or under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) , constitute the actus reus of conspiracy. 

49Her Honour observed (at [30]) that the actus reus of conspiracy was the participation in the agreement. Her Honour stated (at [35]) that the offence of conspiracy depends upon the existence of, or participation in, an agreement, and not the precise timing of the formation of the agreement. Her Honour drew an analogy with the circumstances in Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot in reaching this view (at [36]-[38]). 

50It is necessary to say something more concerning the propositions that, firstly, the crime of conspiracy at common law is complete when the agreement is made and, secondly, that conspiracy is a continuing offence. 

51The decision of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot was called in aid by this Court in R v G, F, S and W [1974] 1 NSWLR 31 to explain the concept of conspiracy as a continuing offence, and the application of that concept in a temporal respect, and not merely concerning geographical jurisdiction. In that case, the trial Judge had held that, as an unlawful agreement had been made by a certain date, the crime of conspiracy had, by then, been committed. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Kerr CJ, McClemens CJ at CL and Lee J) disagreed. Their Honours said at 43B (emphasis added): 

""But, the decision of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Doot makes it clear that it is not correct to consider the crime of conspiracy as nothing more than the making of the initial unlawful agreement. The decision makes it clear that, although the essence or gist of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement made by the conspirators, and not the acts done under it (which individually may or may not be criminal), conspiracy as a crime is committed wherever and whenever it is shown that the agreement, the unlawful concert, exists between the conspirators ."" 

52Their Honours then referred to passages in the judgments of Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Pearson in Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot , and then stated at 44D-F (emphasis added): 

""From these statements we deduce the conclusion earlier referred to, that the crime of conspiracy is a crime not limited to the making of the unlawful agreement, but committed whilst ever the unlawful agreement is in existence. The agreement may exist but for a moment - because the conspirators are detected immediately after they make their agreement - or it may exist for years. Whilst ever the unlawful purpose or concert is shown to be in existence between the conspirators, the conspirators are conspiring and the crime of conspiracy is being committed. It is a crime of duration, a continuing offence . So viewed the overt acts proved will individually or collectively, of course, be indicative of the formation earlier of the unlawful purpose, but their full role is to establish the existence of the unlawful purpose from that earlier point in time to whenever the conspiracy was discovered. That will be the crime of conspiracy charged in the indictment. Conspiracy is invariably charged as having been committed between certain dates - it is the conspiring, the continuation in existence of the unlawful purpose, between the dates alleged which is the crime charged, and which is the matter to be proved."" 

53The characterisation of conspiracy as a crime of duration, a continuing offence which lasts as long as it is being performed, has been emphasised: Woss v Jacobsen (1985) 11 FCR 243 at 250; R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 458F. 

54Support for the Crown submission in the present case may also be found in the judgment of Fenton-Atkinson J in R v Simmonds [1969] 1 QB 685 at 696, cited with approval by Hope JA in Saffron v R (1988) 17 NSWLR 395 at 422. Fenton-Atkinson J said: 

""This argument is based on a complete fallacy as to the nature of conspiracy. Of course, if two men agree on a particular day to embark on a course of criminal conduct over a period of months, the offence of conspiracy is committed at the moment of agreement. But they remain conspirators and their conspiracy continues until either the criminal purpose has been achieved or their agreement has been brought to an end. 

The offence of conspiracy has clearly over the centuries been committed by being a member of what in the old books is referred to as a 'confederacy' - that is to say, being one of two or more persons acting or planning to act in concert under some agreement - be it express or implied - in pursuit of a criminal design. 

Furthermore, it is well-established law that if A and B conspire together to carry on, for example, a course of fraudulent trading, C may join in (or in the old phraseology 'adhere to') the conspiracy at a later date and then A may drop out and be replaced by D. But it all remains a single conspiracy as long as all of them are for the period of their participation acting in combination to achieve the same criminal objective."" 

55In Savvas v The Queen [1995] HCA 29; 183 CLR 1 at 8, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: 

""It is commonplace that the ingredients of the offence of conspiracy are complete once there is agreement between two or more persons [Gerakiteys v R (1984) 153 CLR 317 at 327, 334; 51 ALR 417; Kamara v Director o f Public Prosecutions [1974] AC 104 at 119] . But it is equally plain that the conspiracy does not end with the making of the agreement. 'It will continue so long as there are two or more parties to it intending to carry out the design' [Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot [1973] AC 807 at 823. See also R v G, F, S and W [1974] 1 NSWLR 31 at 43-4] . "" 

56In Truong v The Queen [2004] HCA 10; 223 CLR 122, Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ observed at 143-144 [35]: 

""Furthermore, the conspiracy was alleged to have continued in existence, and to have been completed by performance. Although a crime of conspiracy has been committed, and in that sense is complete, once an agreement to commit a crime has been made, conspiracy is a continuing offence. It is an error to think that the crime comes to an end once the agreement has come into existence. That is the error that was rejected by this court in Savvas v R [ (1995) 183 CLR 1; 129 ALR 319]. The point was explained b y Lord Pearson in Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot [[1973] AC 807 at 827] : 

A conspiracy involves an agreement expressed or implied. A conspiratorial agreement is not a contract, not legally binding, because it is unlawful. But as an agreement it has its three stages, namely (1) making or formation (2) performance or implementation (3) discharge or termination. When the conspiratorial agreement has been made, the offence of conspiracy is complete, it has been committed, and the conspirators can be prosecuted even though no performance has taken place ... But the fact that the offence of conspiracy is complete at that stage does not mean that the conspiratorial agreement is finished with. It is not dead. If it is being performed, it is very much alive. So long as the performance continues, it is operating, it is being carried out by the conspirators, and it is governing or at any rate influencing their conduct. The conspiratorial agreement continues in operation and therefore in existence until it is discharged (terminated) by completion of its performance or by abandonment or frustration or however it may be."" 

57In my view, the analogy drawn by Simpson J in this case by reference to Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot is apt. The fact that the decision in that case concerned geographical jurisdiction is not the point and is no reason to place the decision to one side. Reliance upon the decision, in a temporal sense, to understand the nature of conspiracy as a continuing offence is both appropriate and helpful to the resolution of the issues in the present case. As the cases referred to at [51]-[56] above make clear, other Courts in Australia have utilised the decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot in precisely this way. 

58The concept of a continuing offence has been considered in Australia, principally in the context of regulatory offences, including alleged environmental or industrial safety offences. See, for example, in Victoria - R v Industrial Appeals Court; Ex parte Barelli's Bakeries Pty Limited [1965] VR 615 at 620 and R v Industrial Appeals Court; Ex parte Circle Realty Pty Limited [1980] VR 459 at 461-462, and in New South Wales - CSR Limited v Environment Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 373; 110 LGERA 334 at 340-342 [39]-[53]; Environment Protection Authority v Alkem Drums Pty Limited [2000] NSWCCA 416; 121 A Crim R 152 at 154-156 [7]-[16], 161-166 [43]-[79]; Burgess v Kaputar Timbers Pty Limited (1999) 91 IR 378 at 382. 

59A passage cited frequently in this State concerning the nature of a continuing offence appears in the judgment of Street CJ in Sloggett v Adams (1953) 70 WN(NSW) 206 at 208 (emphasis added): 

""'The question whether the offence which has been committed is a continuing offence, or one which was committed once and for all at a specified time, depends upon consideration of the language of the Act in question. Some offences once committed are complete and concluded and exist only in the past. Other offences, however, are continuing offences and are committed day by day so long as the state of affairs which is forbidden continues to exist, and the person responsible for creating that state of affairs is liable day by day for those offences . The test, it seems to me, is one which was prescribed in Ellis v Ellis [(1896) P 251 at 254] , by Sir Francis Jeune, who said: 'The test whether an offence is to be treated in law as continuous is, I think, whether its gravamen is to be found in something which the offender can, at will, discontinue'."" 

60To my mind, this general description of a continuing offence is helpful in understanding the way in which the offence of conspiracy at common law was said to constitute a continuing offence. Of particular relevance is the statement of Street CJ that continuing offences ""are committed day by day so long as the state of affairs which is forbidden continues to exist, and the person responsible for creating that state of affairs is liable day by day for those offences"" . This is an apt description of a conspiracy and, as it happens, utilises the term ""state of affairs"" , a phrase to which I will return. 

61Further support for her Honour's conclusion may be found in the statement that, in cases of conspiracy, it is not necessary to prove formation of the agreement at some definite time: Nirta v R (1983) 51 ALR 53 at 61. Although a conspiracy may be established by proving an agreement which has never been implemented, it is not necessary in the usual case of conspiracy where a succession of overt acts are relied upon, to establish the date when, or the date before which, the conspiratorial agreement was made: Saffron v R at 419. The prosecution is not bound to define the exact time at which the agreement began or the exact act which marked its inception: Saffron v R at 436-437; R v H Mokbel (Ruling No. 2) [2009] VSC 547 at [17]. 

62With respect, I agree with the statement of Simpson J at first instance that the offence of conspiracy depends upon the existence of, or participation in an agreement, and not the precise timing of its formation. The Applicants have not demonstrated error in her Honour's conclusions in this respect. 
 
Suggested Error in Application of Statutory Modifications to Common Law of Conspiracy Brought About by s.135.4(9) of the Code 

63The Applicants' second argument is that, whatever may have been the position at common law, s.135.4(9) of the Code involves a statutory modification of the common law so that it is essential for the Crown to prove the entry into an agreement within the period covered by the second count, and that there is no evidence whatsoever of the entry into an agreement in that period so that the second count is foredoomed to fail. 

64It may be taken that the task of the Court is to interpret the words used by Parliament and not to determine what Parliament intended to say: R v JS at 135 [142]. 

65The judgments of the High Court of Australia in The Queen v LK observed that the principles relating to conspiracy at common law were relevant to questions arising with respect to offences against s.11.5 of the Code - French CJ at 206 [59] and Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ at 220 [97], 224 [107]. Sections 11.5 and 135.4 of the Code are relevantly indistinguishable, so that these observations should be taken to extend to s.135.4 as well. 

66Similar views were expressed by Spigelman CJ (James and Howie JJ agreeing) in R v B at 541-542 [31]-[34]. 

67The similarities and differences between the offence in s.11.5 of the Code and the common law offence of conspiracy were considered by Howie J (Hislop J agreeing) in R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89 at 105-106 [66]: 

""Thus the offence of conspiracy under the Code is similar to that at Common Law. Both under the Code and at Common Law two or more persons must mean to enter into an agreement that an offence would be committed by themselves or some other person. The differences between the Code offence and the offence at Common Law are that, firstly, under the Code it is not an offence to enter into an agreement to commit a lawful act by unlawful means and, secondly, it is not an offence under the Code to agree to commit a crime for which the maximum penalty is less than that stated in the section. It should also be noted that under the Code it is not sufficient to support a conviction of a conspiracy offence that there has only been an agreement entered into by the parties: there must also be an overt act committed by at least one person toward the achievement of the object of the agreement."" 


68These observations of Howie J were not criticised in the decision of the High Court of Australia in Ansari v The Queen [2010] HCA 18; 241 CLR 299. 

69The elements of the offence of conspiracy are found relevantly in s.135.4(5) of the Code: The Queen v LK at 205-206 [57], 212 [75], 213 [78], 216-217 [91]. The requirements contained in s.135.4(9) of the Code inform and explain the meaning of ""conspires"" , but are not elements of the offence for the purposes of Part 2.2 of the Code: The Queen v LK at 205-206 [57], 228 [117], 232 [132]-[133], 233-234 [137], 234-235 [141]. 

70Although not elements of the offence charged in the second count, it may be taken that it will be necessary for the Crown to prove the matters contained in s.135.4(9) of the Code before each of the Applicants may be found guilty of an offence under that section. 

71I accept that the only presently relevant alteration to the common law is that effected by s.135.4(9)(c), which requires proof of the commission of an overt act pursuant to the agreement. As Howie J observed in Ansari v R , this was an intended modification of the common law offence to be incorporated in the Code. 

72I do not accept the submission for the Applicants that s.134.5(9)(a) requires the Crown to adduce evidence that a person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons on or after 24 May 2001. I agree with the conclusion of Simpson J that what is required is proof of the existence of, or participation in, an agreement and not a requirement that the agreement was formed on or after 24 May 2001. In my view, this construction serves to promote the purpose or object underlying the Code: s.15AA Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) . 

73I agree with Simpson J's conclusion that the physical element for the purpose of s.4.1(1) of the Code is conduct, in the sense of ""a state of affairs"" : s.4.1(2). 

74I agree with Simpson J that the position advanced by the Applicants would lead to a highly artificial and absurd result. As her Honour observed at [40], it would be absurd to suggest that an agreement that had its inception prior to the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Code, but that continued, and continued to be implemented thereafter, could not be prosecuted under the Code because the alleged conspirators failed, on the change of legislation to renew, or remake, their agreement. To construe the provisions of the Code in a way that led to this result would not promote the purpose or object underlying the Code. 

75In my view, no error has been demonstrated by the Applicants in her Honour's construction of s.135.4 of the Code. 

Suggested Error in Misconstruing Physical Element of a s.135.4(5) Offence as Being Constituted by ""A State of Affairs"" 

76The Applicants submit that her Honour erred in accepting that the physical element in this case could be satisfied by ""conduct"" in its extended sense of ""a state of affairs"" . I do not accept this submission. 

77As French CJ observed in The Queen v LK at 200 [42], the concept of engaging in conduct which is a state of affairs is not explained in the Code. In R v Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108; 61 NSWLR 135, Bell J (Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) referred, at 144 [58], to the definition of ""conduct"" in s.4.1(2) of the Code: 

""'Conduct' is defined in s 4.1(2) of the Criminal Code to mean 'an act, an omission to perform an act or a state of affairs'. The latter picks up Brennan J's observation in Teh that having something in possession is not easily seen as an act or omission and is more easily seen as a state of affairs: at 564 (see, too, the discussion of 'status offences', such as being in a prohibited place or condition, in Fisse B, Howard's Criminal Law (Sydney: Law Book Co, 5th ed, 1990), at 12). It is noteworthy that Brennan J in Teh observed that the identification of the prohibited act on the one hand and the circumstances attendant on doing the act on the other was an exercise that gave rise to 'intractable difficulties':"" 

78Reference has been made to the term ""state of affairs"" in the Code in The Queen v Tang [2008] HCA 39; 237 CLR 1 at 24-25 [46]-[47] and Muslimin v The Queen [2010] HCA 7; 240 CLR 470 at 479 [16], but not in ways that assist resolution of the present controversy. 

79Simpson J concluded (at [39]) that ""a state of affairs"" includes ""the existence (continuing) of an agreement to defraud the Commonwealth"" . I accept the Crown submission that an ongoing conspiracy is a state of affairs, and hence conduct, within the meaning of the Code, and that being a party to an ongoing conspiracy is a state of affairs with the same consequence. 

80What is necessary to establish an offence under s.135.4(5) of the Code is a physical element which may be conduct, or a result of conduct, or a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct, occurs: s.4.1(1). All of these may be encompassed in a state of affairs. 

81This conclusion is consistent with the ordinary meaning of a ""state of affairs"" . According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ""the (or a) state of things or affairs"" means ""the way in which events or circumstances stand disposed (at a particular time or within a particular sphere)"" . 

82Further, the term ""state of affairs"" sits comfortably with the concept of a continuing offence. The statement of Street CJ in Sloggett v Adams , (set out at [59] above) although made in a different context, may be called in aid (at least by analogy), to support the conclusion that a continuing offence (conspiracy) is ""committed day by day so long as the state of affairs which is forbidden continues to exist, and the person responsible for creating that state of affairs is liable day by day"" for that offence. 

83It is noteworthy that s.135.4(12) of the Code provides that a person cannot be guilty of an offence under the section if, before the commission of an overt act pursuant to the agreement, the person withdrew from the agreement and took all reasonable steps to prevent the doing of the thing. The concept of a continuing offence, which may be terminated by withdrawal, is recognised within the Code concerning conspiracy. 

84No error has been demonstrated in Simpson J's conclusion that the physical element of the offence charged in the second count may be established by conduct in the sense of ""a state of affairs"" . 

Suggested Errors Concerning Construction of Transitional Provisions 

85The submissions of the parties dealt briefly with the question whether her Honour erred in her construction of the transitional provisions (at [42]-[47]). The matter may be dealt with shortly in this judgment. 

86The principal submission of the Applicants in this respect is that her Honour had side stepped the construction of the transitional provisions by concluding that the physical element in the second count may be constituted by conduct in the form of ""a state of affairs"" . 

87Simpson J (at [45]) stressed the omission of ""state of affairs"" from s.4(2) Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 (Cth) . 

88I do not accept the Applicants' submission. For reasons expressed earlier (at [76]-[84] above), her Honour was correct in the conclusion concerning the applicability of the physical element taking the form, in this case, of conduct in the sense of ""a state of affairs"" . 

89In my view, her Honour's analysis and application of the transitional provisions is correct. 

A Crown Submission that Her Honour had Erred 

90Simpson J (at [49]-[51]) rejected a Crown submission that relied upon the use of the past tense in s.135.4(9)(a) of the Code in order to argue that an agreement predating the introduction of Chapter 7 was sufficient to establish the necessary agreement. Before this Court, the Crown formally submitted that her Honour had erred in this respect. 

91I am not persuaded that her Honour erred in the manner contended for by the Crown. Her Honour's reasons are persuasive. I reject the Crown submission on this aspect. 

Conclusion 

92The Applicants have not demonstrated error in any respect in her Honour's reasons for refusing to permanently stay the second count. It has not been demonstrated that the second count is foredoomed to fail so that the prosecution of that count should be permanently stayed. 

93As the issues raised on these applications are of importance with respect to the construction and operation of s.134.5 of the Code in these and other current prosecutions, I would grant leave to appeal with respect to grounds directed to the refusal to permanently stay the second count upon the basis that it was foredoomed to fail. 

94A number of submissions advanced by Mr Barker QC appeared to extend beyond that issue to matters concerning what was said to be tension or conflict between the offences charged in the indictment, and the particulars relied upon by the Crown with respect to the alleged offences. I am not satisfied that leave to appeal ought be granted with respect to these issues which travel beyond the foredoomed to fail argument relied upon in support of the permanent stay application. 

95I propose the following orders: 

(a) grant leave to the Applicants under s.5F(3)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal against the interlocutory judgment or order of Simpson J refusing a permanent stay of the second count on the indictment; 

(b) appeals dismissed. 


96HALL J : I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Johnson J.

		06 August 2013",2011-05-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757051,R v Agius; R v Abibadra; R v Jandagi; R v Zerafa (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 482,"Judgment 

1Each of the four accused (Robert Francis Agius, Carol Abibadra, Deborah Judith Jandagi, Kevin Zerafa) is charged, on indictment, with two counts of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. The trial was fixed to commence on 27 April 2011, and was anticipated to be lengthy. The estimates have varied, the most recent (as I understand it) being 12 weeks. For reasons it is not here necessary to explore, the trial did not proceed on 27 April, and has still not commenced (see R v Agius; R v Abibadra; R v Jandagi; R v Zerafa [2011] NSWSC 367; Agius v R; Abibadra v R; Jandagi v R; Zerafa v R [2011] NSWCCA 119). It is hoped that the trial, with a jury, will commence in the near future. 

2By notices of motion filed, respectively, on 9 and 11 May 2011, each accused now seeks on a temporary basis, a stay of the trial, as a result of publicity which each accused contends is likely to have an adverse impact on the fairness of the forthcoming trial, and deflect some or all of the citizens selected to constitute the jury in the trial from performing the duty which they will be sworn or affirmed to perform. 

3Put briefly, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""the CDPP""), who brings the prosecutions, alleges that each accused participated in a scheme the purpose of which was to enable various clients of an accountancy firm dishonestly to evade income tax. A very large quantity of documentation will form, if not the bulk, then a very considerable part, of the Crown case. 

4It is (again, as I understand it) the Crown case that the first accused (Mr Agius) was an Australian accountant practising in Vanuatu, and the remaining three accused were accountants (or, in one case, a para-accountant) employed by an accounting firm in Sydney. I infer that it is alleged that the tax evasion operation was based in, or at least had significant links to, Vanuatu. 

5It is common ground that the prosecutions arise out of an operation conducted by the Australian Taxation Office (and, perhaps, other Commonwealth authorities - the evidence on this application does not clearly disclose which Commonwealth authorities were involved, and it does not, for present purposes, matter) known by the code name ""Operation (or Project) Wickenby"". Operation Wickenby, it is reasonably clear, targeted many individuals and companies suspected of defrauding the Commonwealth revenue by evading taxation. Just what its reach was is immaterial for the purposes of this judgment, but it is clear that it was a very extensive project, and one that had been in existence for a considerable time. 

6The present application for temporary stay of proceedings is based on a burst of publicity that commenced on 3 May 2011, in a daily newspaper circulating throughout Australia, including Sydney, called the Australian Financial Review (""the AFR""). On 3 May and the two succeeding days, 4 and 5 May, the AFR published a very extensive examination of what it called ""The Wickenby Saga"". Further material was published in the weekend edition of the AFR, of 7-8 May. 

7It is convenient here to note affidavit evidence produced on behalf of the CDPP concerning the circulation of the AFR. That information was drawn from the website of the publisher of the AFR, the accuracy of which was not questioned. The weekday readership is said to be 255,000, and weekend readership 153,000. 

8By reference to population figures contained in a website maintained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the solicitor representing the CDPP calculated that, even if the entire weekday readership resided in NSW, there was: 

""a close to 0% probability that a juror from New South Wales would have read the AFR on any given weekday."" 

Criticism was made of this affidavit, in part because the basis of the calculation was not given. 

9In a subsequent affidavit, provided after the hearing, the solicitor deposed to his amended calculation that: 

""... even if the AFR's entire weekday readership resided in New South Wales, there is an approximately 3.5% probability that a juror from New South Wales would have read the AFR on any given weekday."" 

In the subsequent affidavit, the basis of that calculation was spelled out. 

10The first article, published on 3 May, began in a prominent place on the front page, and continued over four full pages inside. It bore, on the front page the headline: 

""Revealed: inside Australia's biggest tax sting."" 

It directed readers to p 50 of the newspaper, which was the first of the four full pages. On p 50, the article identified its theme, in the following passage: 

""In a three-part series, the Wickenby story reveals how hiding your money overseas became commonplace for a rising class of entrepreneurs; how an Australian Taxation Office operation became the centre of a global attack on tax haven bank accounts; and the attempts to pressure politicians to shut down or limit investigations."" 

It said that the operation had resulted in 2800 audits, had ""raked in"" $553 million and had sent 18 people to prison, while 42 remained to be tried. 

11The second article, on 4 May, bore the headline: 

""ATO adds 500 to Wickenby probe"" 

on the front page; again, readers were directed to a further examination, over three pages, p 59, p 60 and p 61. This article purported to contain quotations from very senior Commonwealth tax and law enforcement figures. It will therefore be necessary to return to it. 

12The third article, published on 5 May, was headed ""Serious threats to tax revenue""; and the fourth ""Big stick gets the job done"". 

13None of the four accused was named in any of the articles. There were occasional references to Vanuatu; for example, in a time line accompanying the 3 May article, it was said that, in December 2006 ""Police start investigating a Vanuatu scheme involving [a named] Sydney accountant"" (not one of the accused). In the body of that article, reference was made to another named person (again, not one of the accused) who was said to have had business links with Vanuatu. Later, it was said that an audit of an Australian accounting firm (not named) had revealed that many of the firm's clients were paying invoices to Vanuatu, and that the Australian Federal Police had run four separate operations investigating suspected cash transfers to and from Vanuatu. This was immediately followed by the observation that it was important to note that there were ""plenty of legitimate investments in the island"". 

14At a very early point, the same article had recorded: 

""Not every taxpayer targeted by Wickenby is guilty of tax crime, and it is wrong to make any assumptions about those charged until their cases are decided by the courts."" 

15In the part of the article that appeared on the front page of the 3 May edition of the AFR, a quote was attributed to the Commissioner of Taxation, identified as Michael D'Ascenzo, in the following terms: 

""You could just see how easy it was for someone to come here with a laptop, sign some people on and suddenly all the documentation gets done overseas ... there's nothing more cancerous - once these things catch on, they become like wildfire."" 

16As I have indicated above, the articles purport to quote a number of senior Commonwealth authorities, including Mr D'Ascenzo; the ""Chief"" of the Australian Crime Commission (named as John Lawler, and, later, Alastair Milroy); a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (identified as Michael Cranston), and the CDPP himself, Christopher Craigie. Others, from the private sector, were also quoted. 

17Mr Lawler was (purportedly) quoted as saying: 

""What's happened is these people are sponging off the normal taxpayer. And it's as simple and easy as that."" 

18The CDPP, Mr Craigie, was (purportedly) quoted in the articles of 3 and 4 May; in the first, he is said to have described ""Wickenby"" as: 

""A very serious threat to the taxation system and something that could cripple the revenue."" 

In the article of 4 May, he purports to have been quoted more extensively, referring to ""the protection of the revenue"", ""criminality"", ""where someone signs documents that are plainly false and misrepresent what is going on and become part of a structure that is plainly a fantasy when you look behind it ..."", ""It's a con and it's a con on the Australian people once you strip it away"". 

19Of course, there is no way of knowing how accurate these purported quotations are. However, it would be very surprising if the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions were, in such close temporal propinquity to a trial, to have made public statements directly relevant to the prosecution. 

20It is by reason of the extensive coverage of the Wickenby investigation, and the direct passages to which I have referred, that it was argued, on behalf of each of the accused, that the fairness of the trial has been affected, and that a stay, for a period of about two months, ought to be granted, in order to allow the contamination to dissipate. 

21In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No 19) [2007] NSWSC 536, Johnson J considered a similar application (where a trial had begun, but had, for reasons quite unrelated to the parties, aborted, and a new trial was scheduled to begin) and stated, briefly the relevant principles: see [39]-[44]. There the publicity of which complaint was made was an item broadcast on a current affairs program on ABC radio, following the discharge of the jury. 

22As Johnson J noted, the test is one of fairness, and fairness is evaluated by balancing the interests of the accused, and of society, in the fair trial of allegations of criminal offences and of bringing to trial, without delay, persons accused of such offences. 

23Inherent in the criminal justice system is the dependence upon, and faith in, juries, properly instructed, to undertake the task committed to them, which is to return a true verdict upon the evidence - that is, on the evidence tendered orally, or by documentation, in court. 

24That dependence was expounded in Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237. There, on a charge of murder (the accused having been convicted, having successfully appealed, and a new trial having been ordered), the accused had been exposed to an extraordinary level of publicity, in virtually every kind of media outlet: see [7]. The application there made was for permanent stay, but the High Court rejected both that and the alternative, a stay until further order. 

25It is true that, in that case, the proposed trial being a re-trial after successful appeal, the court was in a stronger position to appreciate precisely what evidence was available against the accused. However, the nature of the case made against the present accused is sufficiently clear. 

26It is also to be borne in mind that the authors of the articles in the AFR were at some pains to point out that not all individuals caught up in the Wickenby investigation could be presumed to be guilty of any offence, and that guilt or otherwise remained to be determined by the judicial system. 

27Moreover, the articles were published in a serious and sober publication, devoted (as its name implies) to matters of finance and economics and were not directly concerned, so far as the ordinary reader could tell, with the transactions alleged against the present accused. Although there were some colourful illustrations, no doubt to attract the readers' attention, the articles could hardly have been considered sensationalist. They were a carefully constructed account of the investigation, as the authors perceived it. 

28It was never suggested that a stay should be permanent. When invited to specify the period of the proposed stay, two months was nominated. 

29For reasons unrelated to the AFR publications, this trial has been further delayed; it is unlikely that, with the best intentions in the world, it can commence earlier than three weeks after the publications. 

30I am also conscious of the calculations performed by the solicitor for the CDPP, indicating the low level of likelihood that any juror would actually have read the articles. Although criticism was made that the original calculations lacked transparency, no real attack was made on them and certainly no alternative calculations were offered. 

31Finally, it cannot be overlooked that in the age of communication in which criminal trials now take place, vast amounts of information is available to jurors, no matter how remote the date of publication. The law has devised means of ensuring that jurors do not disobey the directions given to them concerning undertaking their own researches and taking into account extraneous material: see, for example Jury Act 1977 (NSW), s 68C. 

32I note that, although when the trial begins and in the pre-trial applications (including this) the Court will be and is exercising federal jurisdiction, it was not suggested that any particular issues arise that would call for a different approach: see Dupas , [15]. 

33I see no basis upon which the trial ought further be delayed by reason of the publications in the AFR. 

34Each notice of motion is dismissed.

2757055,R v McHarg [2011] NSWCCA 115,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA : I agree with Johnson J. 

2HIDDEN J : I agree with Johnson J. The modest increase of the effective non-parole period is significant for this young offender, facing his first term of imprisonment as an adult. 

3JOHNSON J : This is a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences imposed at the Parramatta District Court on 24 September 2010, upon the Respondent, Nathan McHarg, for a number of serious offences. 

4Following pleas of guilty, the Respondent was sentenced by Robison DCJ on 24 September 2010 for the following offences: 





Offence 

Sentence 


First offence - specially aggravated detain for advantage (in company and inflict actual bodily harm) contrary to s.86(3) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 25 years' imprisonment)

Imprisonment for a fixed term of three years commencing 27 October 2009 and expiring 26 October 2012 

5In passing sentence for the fourth offence (robbery in company), the sentencing Judge took into account on a Form 1 a further offence of robbery in company. 

6The total effective sentence of imprisonment for all offences comprised a non-parole period of three years and 11 months commencing 27 April 2009 and expiring 26 March 2013, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 27 March 2013 and expiring on 26 March 2016. 

Grounds of Appeal 

7A Notice of Appeal was filed by the Crown on 27 October 2010 upon the ground that the sentences were manifestly inadequate. In accordance with usual practice ( R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 199 A Crim R 486 at 496-497 [33]-[38]), the Crown filed a document on 28 January 2011 giving notice of additional grounds of appeal. The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to give proper consideration to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost in relation to the offence of reckless wounding in company. 

(b) Ground 2 - the resulting non-parole period and total sentence imposed on the reckless wounding in company offence is manifestly inadequate. 

(c) Ground 3 - his Honour erred in imposing an aggregate sentence that failed to properly reflect the objective seriousness of the total criminality. 

(d) Ground 4 - his Honour's failure to adequately accumulate the sentences produced an aggregate sentence that is manifestly inadequate. 

Facts of Offences 

8An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered in the District Court, revealing the following facts. The offences will be referred to in chronological order. They were committed over a 10-month period between 6 December 2008 and 25 October 2009. 

The Form 1 Offence - 6 December 2008 

9About 11.00 pm on Saturday, 6 December 2008, the victim, Gregory Mitchell, attended the Leumeah Railway Station after completing work for the day. The victim entered the platform from the western side of the Railway Station. 

10At the time, a co-offender, Corey Mogford, appeared to be using the public phone on the platform. As the victim walked past Mogford, the victim and Mogford said ""Hi"" to each other. The victim continued to walk along the platform towards a drink-vending machine. As he walked along the platform, a further co-offender, Benjamin Jeffreys, and the Respondent, who had been sitting together on a seat, got to their feet as the victim walked past them. 

11The victim purchased a drink from the vending machine. A few moments later, the victim heard someone say ''Hand over your stuff"" . The victim looked behind him and saw both co-offenders approaching him. Mogford stopped about five metres from the victim. Jeffreys approached the victim and said ""Hand over your stuff, I'm not kidding"" . Jeffreys lifted up his jumper and exposed a black-handled knife with a 15-centimetre blade wedged in his pants. Mogford then said ""Don't worry mate, all three of us have knives"" . 

12Jeffreys then ordered the victim to empty his pockets. The victim handed to Jeffreys his Sony mobile phone, a black leather wallet and his backpack. Whilst this was occurring, the Respondent was a short distance away at the entrance to the platform, keeping watch and ready to assist his co-offenders if required. 

13After the victim handed his property to Jeffreys, Mogford jumped on the tracks and crossed to the eastern platform of the Railway Station. Jeffreys did the same a few seconds later, followed immediately by the Respondent. 

14The victim contacted police and provided a statement in relation to the incident. 

15The whole incident was captured on CCTV footage which clearly depicted the Respondent and his co-offenders. 

Events Leading Up to the First and Second Offences - 26-27 January 2009 

16The Respondent became criminally involved in a serious incident which commenced with offences committed by others upon a pizza delivery man. Although the Respondent did not arrive on the scene until later (see [27] below), to place his offences in context, it is appropriate to describe events which preceded his criminal involvement. 

17At 10.51 pm on Monday, 26 January 2009, a telephone order was placed with the Pizza Hut hotline for pizzas, garlic bread and drinks to be delivered to an address in Mount Pritchard. The name ""Sonny"" was provided and a mobile number [x]. At 10.52 pm, [x] was contacted to confirm the order. 

18The Liverpool Pizza Hut store processed the order. The victim, Paritosh Upadhyay, was working as the delivery driver at the Liverpool store that night. He drove his personal vehicle, a Hyundai Excel Sprint hatchback, to the Mount Pritchard address arriving at about 11.15 pm. The victim was wearing a red Pizza Hut cap and a red Pizza Hut collared polo shirt, bearing the nametag ""Pat"" . 

19The victim exited his vehicle with the food in a black Pizza Hut hot bag, and was carrying a black Pizza Hut bum bag. As he approached the Mount Pritchard premises he heard someone yell out, ""Oi"" . The victim turned around and saw three males. One of the males said, ""It's my pizza"" . The victim walked towards the three males and placed the hot bag on the bonnet of his car. At the same time, Kyal Sukkar, produced a black handgun and pointed it at the victim's face. 

20Sukkar said ""Give me your car key, pizza and all the cash you have"" . Frightened that he would be hurt, the victim handed over his car keys and $35.00 from his bum bag. Sukkar handed the car keys to one of his co-offenders who opened the car's doors, and said ""Get in the back of the car"" . The second male, who was wearing gloves, entered the front passenger seat. Sukkar got into the backseat with the victim, while the third male sat in the driver's seat. When the offenders spoke to one another, they referred to each other as Nos. 1, 2 or 3. 

21Sukkar told the victim to remove his glasses and said ""Don't look at me or try to observe me, otherwise you can describe me to the cops"" . Sukkar punched the victim once in the face to his left cheekbone causing immediate pain. He pushed the victim's face away, so that the victim would not look at him. 

22The third male started the car and drove away. Sukkar made the victim pull his shirt over his face. He told the victim to remove his bum bag from around his waist and then took it from the victim. He searched the victim's pants, locating the victim's wallet. He told the victim to open his wallet. He complied, showing Sukkar that he had no cash. Sukkar told the victim to hand over his key cards. The victim handed Sukkar two key cards in his name (an ANZ card and a Commonwealth Bank Bankcard) as well as a Commonwealth Bank MasterCard in his wife's name. Sukkar grabbed the victim's wallet and went through it, removing two driver's licences, and a Parramatta RSL membership card. He also removed the victim's shirt and handed his cap to the third male who was driving. 

23On patting down the victim's pants, Sukkar located the victim's mobile phone and house keys and said ""Give them to me"" . The victim gave them to Sukkar because he was fearful that he would hurt him. About 10 minutes later, the third male stopped the car and directed the victim to drive. The victim was not allowed out of the vehicle and was forced to squeeze through the space between the two front seats into the driver's seat. While the victim was driving, Sukkar said ""We are on Hoxton Park Road. Where's the nearest ATM?"" The victim said ""George St, or Macquarie St, Liverpool"" . He was first directed to an Aldi supermarket which was closed and then given other directions. The third male said ""We can go to any petrol station"" , but Sukkar said ""No, there's cameras there"" . 

24The victim was given more directions, and about 10 minutes later, the vehicle arrived at Casula Mall and he was told to park a short distance from the Commonwealth Bank ATM. Sukkar handed the second male the victim's key cards. The second male told the victim to get out of the car and followed him to the ATM, saying ""Don't try to run or escape"" . The second male handed each of the key cards to the victim and made him print a balance receipt for each. He then directed the victim to withdraw $200.00 from one account, and either $160.00 or $180.00 from the other account. The victim told the second male that his wife's MasterCard was linked to one of the accounts and the money had already been withdrawn. 

25They walked back to the car where the victim re-entered the driver's seat and was directed towards the Hume Highway and onto the M5, before being told to do a u-turn. The victim did not know where he was, but heard the offenders saying something about Minto. He heard one of the offenders speaking on the telephone stating their location. About 20 minutes later he was directed to a house and told to stop. The second and third males went into the house. 

The Respondent's First and Second Offences 

26About five to 10 minutes later, the victim heard people approaching the car and turned to look in that direction. Sukkar then punched the victim to the side of the face causing him pain. 

27It was at this point that the Respondent arrived on the scene. It may be inferred that he was notified of the location by telephone and decided to join his friends. 

28The Respondent entered the vehicle. The victim heard a different voice in the backseat. The victim was again directed to drive and, about 25 minutes later, was told to stop at a location that he did not recognise but knew to be in Mount Pritchard. 

29The victim was directed to walk towards a reserve while the males followed him. He heard the males discussing breaking the victim's legs and hands, and heard Sukkar say ""Don't kill him"" . A short time later, they arrived at a sports field where the males began assaulting the victim. The victim was punched to the back of the head with such force that it caused him to fall to the ground. He was picked up and punched in the nose, causing him to fall to the ground again. The victim put his arms up to his face to protect his head and pretended to be unconscious. 

30One of the males stabbed the victim in the back. More than one of the males kicked him. He heard one of the males ask ""Are you alive?"" The victim was rolled over, and one of the males stuck a small pruning knife into the victim's left arm. Despite being in considerable pain, the victim remained silent as he was scared. He opened his eyes for a brief moment and saw one of the males holding a broken glass bottle. At some point, the offenders removed the victim's shoes and socks and threw them into a nearby bush. One of the males said ""Where's the key?"" The key was then grabbed from the victim's right hand. The males then left. 

31After waiting for five minutes, the victim ran to a nearby house in Florence Street, Mount Pritchard and was helped by a resident who contacted police, who arrived at about 3.00 am. The victim had been detained for a period of about three-and-a-half hours. 

32As a result of the assaults, the victim sustained bruising and swelling to his face, small abrasions to his left arm, and several small lacerations to his back where he was stabbed with the bottle. 

33The Respondent was questioned by police on 4 February 2009. The Respondent said that on Australia Day evening ""I was pissed. I don't remember. I think I was here, yeah I was here all night"". 

34When police left his house, the Respondent told a neighbour ""They rang me while I was at my sister's place [at Eagle Vale] and told me they kidnapped a Pizza Hut guy and asked if I wanted to get picked up. I said, 'yeah'"" . The Respondent told the neighbour that the victim was being ""smart"" as they drove towards Mt Pritchard. The Respondent said that the victim ""kept putting on his blinkers and wouldn't turn them off, so we would punch him in the face"" . The Respondent said that, when they got back to the Mt Pritchard area, ""we took him to a park and bashed him. I knocked him out. He was out for about two seconds. We stabbed him three times with a broken beer bottle; once in the leg and twice in the back"". 

The Third Offence - 8 February 2009 

35About 12.45 am on Sunday, 8 February 2009, the victim, Andrew Donno, was at Bondi Beach with his girlfriend and two other persons, when he received a telephone call from Michael Boyden. Boyden was with the Respondent at Liverpool Railway Station and he said that they wanted to meet up with the victim for a drink. 

36The victim, in company with his girlfriend and other persons, commenced to travel to Liverpool Railway Station. During that time, the victim received a telephone call from the Respondent. The Respondent was informed that they were only 15 minutes away. 

37At about 1.30 am, the victim and others arrived at Liverpool Railway Station in a green Audi. They met up with the Respondent and Boyden who were in the company of four other persons. The group discussed having a drink and Boyden invited them all back to his house at Lurnea. The group entered two taxis and the green Audi, and then travelled to Boyden's premises. 

38There the group consumed alcohol before they decided to obtain some cannabis. The Respondent, Boyden, the victim and others walked around the Lurnea area for the purpose of purchasing cannabis. Cannabis was obtained near Brain Ave, Lurnea, and the group went to a nearby park where the cannabis was smoked using a porcelain bong. 

39During this time, some of the group had left. The Respondent, Boyden and the victim, along with three or four other people, then walked to Amalfi Park in Riley Street, Lurnea. The group walked to the centre of the park where the victim was confronted by the Respondent, Boyden and an unknown male. The Respondent questioned the victim about being a ""snitch"" . At that point, the victim was punched to the head by the unknown male. The Respondent and Boyden commenced to punch and kick the victim to the head and body. 

40The victim was knocked to the ground a couple of times but regained his feet. During the assault, the Respondent stabbed the victim three times - once in the back around the left shoulder and twice in the upper thigh. 

41All persons then ran from the area. Boyden returned to his premises. 

42In his evidence at the sentencing hearing, the Respondent agreed that the offence with respect to the victim, Andrew Donno, had occurred because the Respondent believed that he had ""snitched"" on him in relation to the ""detaining of the Indian man"" some few days before (the first offence), and the Respondent volunteered that they were ""fighting over a girl as well"" (T20, 24 September 2010). 

43The victim staggered through Amalfi Park for approximately 20 to 30 metres, before collapsing near a fence. Police and ambulance officers arrived. The victim told police that ""Micko"" and ""Nathan"" had attacked him. He was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital for treatment. The victim was found to have three puncture wounds - two to the right thigh and one to the left shoulder. 

44During this time, the Respondent attended Boyden's address and admitted to stabbing the victim. Boyden told the Respondent to ""fuck off"" . The Respondent then left the area. 

45Police attended Liverpool Hospital, where they spoke briefly to the victim who, at the time, could not give a version due to medication he had been administered. 

46At about 9.15 am that morning, police travelled along Bigge Street, Liverpool and observed the Respondent entering Liverpool Railway Station. Police called out to the Respondent who walked quickly away. Police followed the Respondent to the concourse area, losing sight of him momentarily. 

47The Respondent was arrested and cautioned. He was taken to Liverpool Police Station where he was taken into custody. 

48At about 3.30 pm that afternoon, the victim was released from Liverpool Hospital and he gave a brief version of events to police. 

49On 18 February 2009, the Respondent was charged with the third offence. He was refused bail by police. On 19 February 2009, the Respondent was granted conditional bail at the Liverpool Local Court and was released that day. 

The Fourth Offence - 25 October 2009 

50The Respondent was arrested on 17 June 2009 and charged with the first and second offences. He was refused bail by the police. Later that day, he was granted conditional bail at the Liverpool Local Court. The Respondent was unable to meet those conditions, and he remained in custody until 23 September 2009 when the bail conditions were varied and he was released. 

51At about 12.55 am on 25 October 2009, the victim, Mahbubur Ruman, boarded a train at Circular Quay bound for Warwick Farm. He sat in the downstairs section of the carriage attached to the guard's compartment. There were others passengers in the carriage at the time of boarding. As the train pulled into Cabramatta Station, the victim observed that all other passengers in the downstairs section had left the train. 

52At about 1.50 am, the train pulled into Warwick Farm Railway Station. The victim walked to the doors situated closest to the guard's door to exit the train. He observed about seven males at the end of the carriage who were watching him. The victim felt nervous. 

53The victim left the train and began to walk towards the station exit. CCTV footage showed the Respondent, and his co-offender, David Boyden, along with five other persons leave the train, and follow the victim. On leaving the train, the Respondent and his co-offenders attempted to conceal their faces with clothing and hats. 

54At the bottom of the exit ramp, the Respondent and two co-offenders pushed the victim to the ground. The victim's forehead hit the ground, causing him pain. The group surrounded the victim. One of the group yelled ""Get everything from him"" . One of the offenders yelled, ""Where's your fucken mobile or you'll be in trouble?"" In fear of being attacked further, the victim told the group to take everything and pleaded with them not to hurt him. 

55The victim was forced to lay facedown while the Respondent, Boyden, and another male offender forcibly removed his backpack. Inside the backpack was a wallet, containing several bank and identification cards, $500.00 in cash, as well as a black Motorola mobile phone, some books, house keys and car keys. 

56One of the offenders yelled, ""Where is your car?"" The victim indicated towards the Liverpool side of the station. The victim's car was in fact parked on the other side of the station. The victim got to his feet and ran across the road to some townhouses, where he raised a resident who called police, who arrived a short time later. 

57CCTV footage showed all the offenders run from Warwick Farm Railway Station towards the Hume Highway railway overpass, and then towards Forbes Street, Warwick Farm. The footage depicted one of the unknown males enter the carpark and try to open one of the vehicle's doors with a key. He then walked off. 

58Police circulated the CCTV footage to all members of the NSW Police Force. 

59At about 7.40 pm on Tuesday 27 October 2009, the Respondent attended Liverpool Police Station to report on bail. He was placed under arrest, cautioned and taken to the charge room where he was introduced to the Custody Manager. His rights under Part 9 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 were explained to him. Police seized his clothing. 

60The Respondent agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview, during which he made full admissions of his involvement in this incident. He identified himself, David Boyden and Brooke Crawley on the CCTV footage. The Respondent told police that he had been drinking in the city with Boyden and Crawley and was drunk. The Respondent said that he had only met the other four offenders on the train. 

61The Respondent told police that he did not originally want to participate in the robbery, but only did so because he thought that the unknown offenders would turn on him. He said that he attempted to cover his face so that the victim would not be able to identify him. 

62The Respondent told police that during the robbery, he took a train ticket from the victim's pocket and did not receive any other proceeds from the robbery. The Respondent said that during the commission of the offence, all he had said to the victim was ""Don't look at me"" . He recalled hearing someone yell ""Get everything from him"" , and agreed that the victim would have been scared. The Respondent said ""I know it was the wrong thing to do, but he didn't get hurt anyway. I know that sounds bad, but"" . 

63On 27 October 2009, the Respondent was charged with the offence of robbery in company (the fourth offence). Bail was refused. 

64On 12 April 2010, whilst in custody on remand, the Respondent was arrested and charged with the Form 1 offence of robbery in company committed on 6 December 2008. 

65The Respondent has been in continuous custody since 27 October 2009. 

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances 

66The Respondent was born in April 1990. He was between 18 and 19 years' old at the time of his offences, and was 20 years' old at the time of sentence. 

67The Respondent's criminal history commenced in 2005. It contains offences of shoplifting, damaging property, driving offences, goods in custody, being in custody of a knife in a public place (two offences) and driving a conveyance without consent of the owner. 

68The Respondent was placed on probation or bonds with Juvenile Justice supervision by the Children's Court in July 2005, November 2006, February 2008 and April 2008. The November 2006 bond required the Respondent to attend drug and alcohol programs as directed. 

69The Respondent appeared before the Liverpool Local Court on 27 November 2008 with respect to charges of being carried in a conveyance taken without consent of the owner, shoplifting and damaging property. On each charge, he was placed on a bond under s.10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , conditional upon accepting the guidance of a psychiatrist, psychologist or counsellor, taking medication as prescribed and attending for counselling, rehabilitation or educational development in accordance with medical advice. 

70The Respondent's mother gave evidence that she was aware that he was subject to a good behaviour bond, but did not know about the conditions attached to the bond granted on 27 November 2008 (T13, 24 September 2010). 

71All the Respondent's offences which are the subject of this Crown appeal were committed whilst he was subject to the 27 November 2008 bonds. The Form 1 offence and the first, second and third offences were also committed whilst the Respondent was subject to bonds imposed in the Children's Court on 11 February 2008 and 7 April 2008. 

72In between the Form 1 offence (6 December 2008) and the first and second offences (26-27 January 2009), the Respondent appeared in the Children's Court on 19 December 2008 on call-up for sentence for an offence of driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner. He was ordered to perform 50 hours community service. 

73Between the first and second offences (26-27 January 2009) and the third offence (8 February 2009), the Respondent appeared at the Liverpool Local Court on 2 February 2009 and was fined $300.00 for an offence of being in custody of a knife in a public place. 

74Between the third offence (8 February 2009) and the fourth offence (25 October 2009) the Respondent: 

(a) appeared at the Campbelltown Children's Court on 6 April 2009 on a call-up with respect to drive conveyance taken without consent of the owner and fail to appear - he was sentenced, respectively, to a control order for four months commencing on 11 March 2009 and a 14 day control order; 

(b) appealed against the sentences of 6 April 2009 to the Campbelltown District Court which, on 14 May 2009, varied the control order on the drive conveyance charge to one of two months and five days commencing on 11 March 2009 and expiring on 15 May 2009. 

75In addition, the fourth offence (robbery in company committed on 25 October 2009) was committed whilst the Respondent was on bail granted on 19 February 2009 (for the third offence) and 23 September 2009 (for the first and second offences). 

76Not only was it the case that the Respondent's offences were all committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty in the form of bonds or bail, or both, but he appeared from time to time before different courts for sentencing or appeal hearings between 27 November 2008 and 14 May 2009. It may readily be inferred that the court appearances and orders which imposed conditional liberty did not operate so as to put a brake on the Respondent's pattern of serious violent offending. 

77There was no presentence report from the Probation and Parole Service before the sentencing Court. 

78Both the Respondent and his mother gave evidence at the sentencing hearing in the District Court. In addition, a report of Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist dated 19 August 2010 was tendered by the defence. The Respondent had been found in possession of drugs by correctional officers and gave evidence that he found the drugs in the court holding cells and picked them up thinking that they were cigarettes. The sentencing Judge rejected this evidence (ROS, page 12). His Honour observed (ROS, page 12): 

""He [the Respondent] resents authority. He does not like to be told what to do by those who have the responsibility for his custody, care and control."" 

79His Honour noted that Mr Watson-Munro had not been provided with the documents relating to the Respondent's behaviour in custody, and observed that he could only speculate as to Mr Watson-Munro's response if he had been made aware of it. 

80His Honour accepted that the Respondent had a background of turmoil in his life as a young child. The Respondent had an appalling upbringing and a disjointed family and a history of alcohol and drug use (ROS, page 13). The sentencing Judge accepted that the Respondent had a psychological problem and needed help (ROS, pages 14-15). His Honour accepted the Respondent's evidence that he felt sorry for what he had done and considered that the psychological report indicated an element of remorse and contrition and that the Respondent was remorseful (ROS, page 12). 

81The sentencing Judge had regard to the Respondent's youth and said ""if there are any prospects of rehabilitation they should be carefully considered and encouraged if those prospects exist"" (ROS, page 14). 

82His Honour noted that, although the Respondent had not been formally diagnosed with ADHD, he believed that he suffered from it and that the psychological report of Mr Watson-Munro indicated that, to an extent, it explained his criminal behaviour (ROS, page 13). 

83The Respondent's mother gave evidence that he would be offered an apprenticeship by his father on his release from custody (ROS, page 14). 

84The sentencing Judge found special circumstances on the basis of the Respondent's drug problems, his age, his psychological problems and ""matters of that kind"" (ROS, page 16). 

Some Findings in the Remarks on Sentence 

85The sentencing Judge commenced his remarks on sentence with a recital of the maximum penalties for the various offences and the standard non-parole period applicable to the third offence (ROS, pages 1-2). 

86With respect to the first, second and third offences, his Honour allowed a 15% discount for the Respondent's pleas of guilty. A discount of 25% was allowed on the fourth offence for the Respondent's plea of guilty (ROS, page 2). 

87His Honour then made findings of fact in accordance with the summary of facts set out earlier in his judgment (ROS, pages 3-11). 

88With respect to the Respondent's criminal history, his Honour said (ROS, page 11): 

""There is [a] criminal history. It is not helpful as far as this offender is concerned. I take it into account to the limited extent I can, per se it is not strictly speaking an aggravating feature. But it is there before me, I take it into account. 

For someone so young he is certainly no stranger to the criminal justice system, but nevertheless it is important to take it into account to the extent that I am permitted to do so."" 

89His Honour had regard to the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Cogswell SC when sentencing Kyal Sukkar on 15 April 2010. Sukkar was 19 years' old and was said to have ""a negligible criminal record"" . He was sentenced for specially aggravated detain for advantage under s.86(3) Crimes Act 1900 , armed robbery under s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900 and aggravated break, enter and steal under s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900 . Offences of car theft and intentional destruction of a car were taken into account on a schedule in passing sentence for the s.86(3) offence. The total effective sentence was one of imprisonment for six years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and six months. 

90Robison DCJ observed that ""questions of parity certainly arise"" but that ""it should be borne in mind that parity having regard to the authorities does not mean that a sentence should be identical"" but that ""the court needs to be careful to ensure as far as possible that a justifiable sense of grievance does not occur"" (ROS, pages 11-12). 

91His Honour observed that all the offences had occurred whilst the Respondent was subject to conditional liberty and that ""these are matters of significance, they are aggravating features and cannot be ignored"" (ROS, page 11). 

92With respect to the third offence (reckless wounding in company), his Honour referred to aggravating and mitigating factors for the purpose of s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ROS, pages 15-16). His Honour considered that there was an element of gratuitous violence involved in the offence, and found further aggravating features were that the offence was committed when subject to conditional liberty, a weapon was used, a vulnerable victim was involved and, to the extent to which it can be taken into account, the Respondent had a previous record (ROS, page 15). 

93His Honour accepted the Crown submission that the reckless wounding in company offence was ""around about the mid range"" (ROS, page 15). 

94Reference was made to the Respondent's youth and his Honour observed that ""there are prospects of rehabilitation"" (ROS, pages 15-16). 

95His Honour stated that he had applied his mind to the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 and had considered whether each of the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive or partially so, and had then stepped back and looked at the entire result of the sentences for the purpose of considering totality (ROS, page 16). 

96As mentioned earlier, his Honour found special circumstances. 

97When initially announcing the sentences, his Honour purported to set a fixed term of imprisonment of three years for the third offence (reckless wounding in company), for which a standard non-parole period applies. His Honour's attention was then drawn to the necessity to set a non-parole period (s.45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ; Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 at [7]), and his Honour then varied that sentence to one comprising a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 18 months. 

Grounds 1 and 2 - Alleged Errors With Respect to the Third Offence of Reckless Wounding in Company 

98It is appropriate to consider these grounds together, both of which relate to the reckless wounding in company offence (the third offence), for which a standard non-parole period applies. 

Submissions 

99The Crown submitted that the offence imposed in respect of the reckless wounding in company offence was very lenient and suggested that the sentencing Judge had paid scant regard to the standard non-parole period of four years. 

100The Crown pointed to the finding that it was a mid-range offence and that a discount of 15% was allowed for the Respondent's plea of guilty. The Crown pointed as well to the sentencing Judge's initial imposition of a fixed term of three years' imprisonment, with his Honour declining to set a non-parole period because the structure of the sentence to be imposed made it inappropriate. After his Honour's attention was drawn to the requirement to fix a non-parole period flowing from s.45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 , his Honour proceeded to impose, for this offence, a total term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of 18 months. It was submitted that his Honour's original intention was to fix, in effect, a minimum term of three years' imprisonment for the third offence, but that this was transformed to a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 18 months to satisfy the requirement in s.45(1): R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346 at [161]; Hristovksi v R at [65]. 

101The Crown submitted that both the non-parole period imposed for the third offence, and the manner in which it had been reached after his Honour's initial error, indicated that the non-parole period had been calculated without any consideration of the standard non-parole period as a guideline. 

102The Crown submitted that a non-parole period of 18 months for an offence of this nature is so far below the standard non-parole period as to be manifestly inadequate. It was submitted that the Respondent's subjective features were not such as to explain such a departure from the standard non-parole period. 

103It was submitted further that the total sentence imposed for the third offence, which of itself was 12 months less than the standard non-parole period, was manifestly inadequate given the circumstances of the offence. 

104Mr Smith, counsel for the Respondent, submitted that the sentencing Judge had taken into account the standard non-parole period. He pointed to the sentencing Judge's agreement with the Crown submission that the appropriate range for this offence was ""around about the mid range"" and his finding that ""it approaches that [the mid-range] at the very least"" (ROS, page 15). 

105Mr Smith submitted that there are a number of reasons to depart from the standard non-parole period - the plea of guilty, the finding as to objective seriousness, the finding of special circumstances, the Respondent's youth and the fact that the sentence for this offence was part of a structured approach for sentencing the Respondent to give appropriate regard to his overall criminality. 

106Mr Smith submitted that offences against s.35(3) Crimes Act 1900 cover a diverse range of both offending behaviour and the consequences of that behaviour. He submitted that the injuries in this case, described as three puncture wounds, although serious, were towards the lower end of the spectrum because there was no evidence of any ongoing or permanent effects from those injuries. He submitted that the sentencing Judge took into account the fact that the offence was committed in breach of conditional liberty. 

107Mr Smith acknowledged the change from the original sentence imposed for this offence, but submitted that it would be unfair to suggest that the sentencing Judge set the resulting non-parole period without any consideration of the standard non-parole period as a guidepost. 

108Mr Smith submitted that the more pertinent issue was that contained in the second ground of appeal, namely whether the actual sentence imposed for this offence was manifestly inadequate. He emphasised the principle of totality which may involve the lowering of individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 at 63; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 205 ALR 346 at 356 [26]. He submitted that the length of the non-parole period must also be considered in the light of the finding of special circumstances and in the context of totality. He emphasised that the Respondent's youth and rehabilitation were very significant factors on sentence, with considerations of general deterrence and retribution being less significant than they would have been in relation to an older offender. 

109Whilst acknowledging that the sentence imposed for the reckless wounding in company offence was lenient, Mr Smith submitted that it was not manifestly inadequate. 

Decision 

110In approaching these grounds of appeal, it is necessary to keep in mind his Honour's alteration of an original fixed term of imprisonment for three years for this offence, later transformed into a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 18 months. Although his Honour's attention was drawn to the terms of s.45(1) which required that a non-parole period be fixed, it is not at all clear that his Honour had initially selected the fixed term of three years upon the basis that that period should be the equivalent of the non-parole period, in accordance with what was said in R v Dunn and Hristovski v R . 

111His Honour was aware of the standard non-parole period for this offence and had made a finding concerning the objective seriousness of the offence. 

112I agree with Mr Smith that the real complaint by the Crown with respect to this offence is that contained in Ground 2, namely that the non-parole period and the total sentence for this offence were manifestly inadequate. It is to that ground that I now turn. 

113It is the case that a diverse range of offending behaviour is capable of constituting an offence under s.35(3) Crimes Act 1900 . It is necessary to consider the particular circumstances of this case. The sentencing Judge's finding was, in reality, one that the offence lay at about the mid-range of objective seriousness or just below it. That finding is not challenged by the Crown on this appeal. 

114This offence was committed in the early hours of 8 February 2009. At that time, the Respondent was subject to conditional liberty by way of bonds imposed on 11 February 2008 (for offences including being in custody of a knife in a public place), on 7 April 2008 and 27 November 2008. In addition, on 2 February 2009, the Respondent had been fined $300.00 in the Liverpool Local Court for an offence of being in custody of a knife in a public place. 

115The facts of the third offence suggest a degree of planning where the victim, Mr Donno, was requested by the Respondent and his co-offender to travel from Bondi Beach to meet up with them in the Liverpool area. Having met, they travelled to the co-offender's house at Lurnea. Alcohol and cannabis were consumed. Thereafter, the Respondent, the victim and others walked to a park at Lurnea. In the centre of the park, the victim was confronted by the Respondent and two other men. The Respondent questioned the victim about being a ""snitch"" with respect to the first offence committed a few days before. The victim was punched to the head by one of the men. The Respondent and Boyden commenced to punch and kick the victim to the head and body. The victim was knocked to the ground a couple of times, but regained his feet. 

116During the assault, the Respondent stabbed the victim once in the back around the left shoulder and twice in the upper thigh. 

117An appropriate inference is that the victim was sufficiently injured in the attack so that he staggered a relatively short distance before collapsing, thereafter requiring medical assistance. 

118Accordingly, the Respondent committed this offence in the following circumstances: 

(a) in company with other persons - an element of the offence; 

(b) by stabbing the victim three times during the course of a physical assault, in which the victim was punched and kicked by persons including the Respondent; 

(c) with the motive being to question and punish the victim for his assistance to police about the serious offence committed days earlier by a number of persons, including the Respondent; 

(d) whilst being subject to several good behaviour bonds; 

(e) one of those good behaviour bonds was for an offence of having custody of a knife in a public place, with the Respondent having been fined, as well, in the Local Court for a similar offence only six days prior to the commission of the subject offence. 

119In reality, the Respondent has very little operating in his favour by way of subjective circumstances. He had an unhappy family history and a substantial history of offending in the Children's Court. There was no presentence report before the District Court nor any indication of the contents of Department of Juvenile Justice reports which would have been provided to sentencing courts for his juvenile offending. 

120It seems apparent that some evidence concerning the Respondent's background had been placed before the Liverpool Local Court on 27 November 2008, culminating in the granting of a 12-month bond upon condition that the Respondent accept the guidance of a psychiatrist, psychologist or counsellor, and that he should take medication as prescribed and attend counselling, rehabilitation or educational development in accordance with medical advice. However, it does not seem that any significant action was taken to implement these conditions with the Respondent's mother not being aware of their existence (see [70] above). 

121It is necessary to make allowance for the Respondent's youth at the time of this offence (18 years and nine months), the objective seriousness of the crime and the Respondent's subjective circumstances. It is necessary to keep in mind, as well, the fact that this was one sentence amongst several being imposed, and that the sentencing Judge had regard to the principle of totality (see [108] above). 

122Has the Crown established that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, that is, that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust ( Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [27])? 

123It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because (if it be the case), the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her own discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. 

124Nor is appellate intervention on the ground of manifest inadequacy justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v the King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 85 ALJR 195 at 207-208 [58]. 

125I am satisfied that the sentence imposed for this offence was manifestly inadequate. The sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. The Crown has demonstrated error in the determination of this sentence. 

126The maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 10 years with a standard non-parole period of four years. This was a planned offence where the victim was taken to a place and stabbed by the Respondent as a means of punishment for his assistance to police over the serious offence committed days before. 

127Having regard to the objective seriousness of the crime, the Applicant's subjective circumstances, the 15% discount for his plea of guilty and a finding of special circumstances (for the reasons given at [84] above), I am satisfied that a total sentence of four years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of not less than two years and six months was required for this offence. I do not accept the submission for the Respondent that the sentence imposed was lenient but not manifestly inadequate. 

128In reaching this conclusion, I have effectively considered Grounds 1 and 2 together, although it is Ground 2 which is the operative ground giving rise to this conclusion. 
 
 
Grounds 3 and 4 - Alleged Error in the Aggregate Sentence and the Approach to Accumulation 

129Once again, it is appropriate to deal with these grounds of appeal together. 

Submissions 

130The Crown submitted that when proper regard was had to the objective seriousness of the various offences for which the Respondent was to be sentenced, and his subjective circumstances, the total effective sentence imposed upon the Respondent was manifestly inadequate. It was emphasised that all offences were committed whilst the Respondent was subject to conditional liberty and that the first offence (specially aggravated detain for advantage in company and inflict actual bodily harm) constituted another and discrete serious offence of violence on the Respondent's part, committed only days before the reckless wounding in company offence. Whilst acknowledging that the Respondent joined in this offence a considerable time after the co-offender Sukkar had initiated it, the Respondent himself then committed significant acts of violence upon the victim. 

131The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge ought to have taken into account the principles in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 456 at 477 in passing sentence. 

132Further, the Crown noted that the sentencing Judge had not mentioned, in his remarks on sentence, the principles of personal or general deterrence. 

133The Crown submitted that at least one manifestly inadequate sentence had been imposed (reckless wounding in company) and that a total effective accumulation of only eight months as between the various sentences was itself manifestly inadequate. 

134Mr Smith accepted that the manner in which the sentencing Judge had structured the sentences was generous to the Respondent. He submitted, however, that this did not mean that such a structure was erroneous. He submitted that the sentencing Judge was confronted with the difficult task of sentencing a young adult offender in relation to a number of serious offences. Although the sentencing Judge knew that a period of effective imprisonment had to be a number of years, there were factors bearing upon the issues of accumulation and totality, as well as the finding of special circumstances, which properly took into account the Respondent's youth and need for a lengthy term of supervision to assist his rehabilitation. 

135Mr Smith submitted that the requirement of totality, in the circumstances of this Respondent, meant that the sentences imposed had to be concurrent to a more significant degree than might be appropriate in other cases. Although acknowledging that minds may differ as to whether or not there should have been accumulation to a greater extent, he submitted that the approach adopted by the sentencing Judge was open in the circumstances of the case. 

136Mr Smith submitted that the total effective sentence imposed on the Respondent was a long one, and that it was open to the sentencing Judge to impose such a sentence in this case. 

Decision 

137Insofar as the Crown suggests error with respect to his Honour's approach to concurrency, accumulation and totality, I bear in mind the principles expressed by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27]: 

""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both."" 

138I have already expressed the view that the sentence imposed for the reckless wounding in company offence was manifestly inadequate and that a total sentence of four years' imprisonment, including a non-parole period of two years and six months, was the appropriate sentence for that offence. 

139I approach the Crown appeal with respect to the issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality with that conclusion in mind. 

140The practical effect of his Honour's sentences was that a total effective non-parole period of three years and 11 months with a balance of term of three years was fixed for three discrete and serious offences of violence. 

141The first offence committed on 26-27 January 2009 involved the Respondent joining in the detention of the unfortunate pizza delivery driver, and a cowardly attack upon him in a park at night by a number of young men, including the use of a broken bottle and a pruning knife as weapons. Although the Respondent had not been party to the entire incident, it is clear that the Respondent joined in and became an active participant in it, knowing that the victim was a pizza delivery driver. This was a terrifying experience for the vulnerable victim. This Court has emphasised the seriousness of crimes of this type. Persons delivering pizzas are vulnerable to robberies because they are alone, carry cash and attend private homes and offences against them are often planned: R v Ferenc [2009] NSWCCA 126 at [21]. Added to this was the Respondent's offence involving unlawful use of the victim's vehicle. The period, purpose and circumstances of detention rendered this a serious offence under s.86(3): Jeffries v R [2008] NSWCCA 144; 185 A Crim R 500 at 511-512 [78]ff; Allen v R [2010] NSWCCA 47 at [20]-[22]. 

142The third offence of reckless wounding in company was committed days after the first and second offences. It was connected to those offences, but not in a manner that favoured the Respondent. The victim was attacked by the Respondent to punish him for his perceived assistance to police concerning the first offence. 

143The fourth offence (robbery in company), committed eight months later on 25 October 2009, involved the robbery of the victim who had alighted from a train in the early hours of the morning, only to be followed by the Respondent and others. The Respondent and others pushed the victim to the ground, his property was taken and the offenders, including the Respondent, enquired as to the location of the victim's car. The incident came to an end only when the victim got to his feet and fled across the road to a nearby house to seek help. 

144The Respondent demonstrated, through his commission of these offences, a preparedness to engage in serious offences of violence over a number of months in 2009. The use of a knife in an offence of violence is a significant matter of aggravation: R v Reid [2005] NSWCCA 309; 155 A Crim R 428 at 436 [25]. 

145The fourth offence and the Form 1 offence both involved the commission of an offence of robbery in company by a group of young men upon a person using the public transport system at night. In R v JW at 523 [207], McClellan CJ at CL, Howie J and I said with respect to offending of this type: 

""It is important to bear in mind that the offences were committed by a group of young men on persons using the public transport system at night. There is no doubt that in the first offence the group were waiting for a likely candidate to rob as he made his way through a secluded park from the station. The group then went to another station and again selected a likely victim and chased him to his home. But even there he was not safe. Crimes of violence committed in those circumstances warranted severe punishment notwithstanding the age of members of the group or the other sentencing principles that apply to the sentencing of young offenders. Persons who are required to use public transport at night should be considered as vulnerable and protected by the sentences imposed in the courts"". 

146The youth of the Respondent was a significant issue on sentence. Nevertheless, the Respondent fell to be sentenced as an adult offender. It was important that the objective seriousness of his offences not be overshadowed by his youth and the undoubted desire to take steps to foster his rehabilitation. It remained necessary as well to have regard to issues of personal and general deterrence. In relation to crimes of violence committed on the streets by groups of young persons, consideration of general deterrence should be given substantial weight, notwithstanding the youth of the offenders: AI v R [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [69]. 

147Given the Respondent's past history of committing offences despite non-custodial sentencing orders in the Children's Court, and his commission of these offences whilst subject to conditional liberty by way of bonds or bail (or both), specific deterrence remained a significant factor on sentence. 

148General deterrence was a significant factor on sentence having regard to statements of this Court concerning robbery offences committed upon persons in and around the public transport system, and the use of knives in the commission of offences of violence. 

149The total effective sentence passed with respect to the Respondent was a substantial one. For a young adult offender, a non-parole period of three years and 11 months with a balance of term of three years is substantial. 

150An assessment of the appropriateness of the total sentence must take into account all the factors to which reference has been made. It is necessary to have regard to the objective seriousness of the offences as well as the Respondent's subjective circumstances, including his youth. 

151The Respondent committed, over a period of months, a range of serious crimes of violence against different victims. Regrettably, the experience of the courts is that these are crimes very frequently committed by young men. It is not uncommon to find those young men operating in groups. 

152In addition, intoxication by one substance or another is not an uncommon scenario for offences of this type. Regrettably, as well, the personal background of many young persons, who commit repeat offences of this type, have been fractured and unhappy. 

153It is clear that a constructive and firm approach to rehabilitative measures may serve not only the personal interest of the young adult offender, but also the public interest, if those measures operate to reduce or remove the prospect of future criminality by that person. 

154The purposes of sentencing contained in s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 are diverse. There must be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 

155It is now necessary to pose the question raised by Grounds 3 and 4. The Crown contends that the total effective sentence, incorporating the levels of accumulation ordered by the sentencing Judge, is manifestly inadequate. The Crown must establish that the total effective sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. It is not enough that this Court would have exercised its sentencing discretion in a manner different to the sentencing Judge (see [122]-[124] above). 

156If called upon to sentence the Applicant at first instance, I would have imposed sentences with a greater degree of accumulation. However, I am not satisfied that the Crown has made good Grounds 3 or 4. The exercise of discretion with respect to accumulation was lenient, but not erroneous. 

157I would reject Grounds 3 and/or 4. 

Discretionary Considerations 

158Error has been demonstrated in accordance with Ground 2, but not Grounds 3 and/or 4. 

159This Court retains a residual discretion to reject the Crown appeal for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW at 515 [150]. 

160In my view, no discretionary basis has been demonstrated for this Court to decline to intervene in the circumstances of this case. 

Resentencing the Respondent 

161I am satisfied that the sentence with respect to the reckless wounding in company offence is manifestly inadequate and that a substitute sentence should be passed. 

162There ought be an additional measure of accumulation to reflect the increased sentence on the third count. Otherwise, the relationship between the sentences for the other offences will remain. 

163The practical outcome of the Crown appeal will see an increase in the effective overall non-parole period for all the Respondent's crimes to one of four years and three months commencing on 27 April 2009 and expiring on 26 July 2013 with an effective overall balance of term of two years and eight months commencing on 27 July 2013 and expiring on 26 March 2016. The effective non-parole period will represent about 61% of the effective head sentence. 

164Although the outcome of the Crown appeal will see an increase of four months only in the total effective non-parole period, this is both appropriate and necessary to reflect the objective seriousness of the third count, taken with the other offences which fell for sentence. 

165I propose the following orders: 

(a) Crown appeal allowed with respect to the third count only; 

(b) sentence imposed upon the Respondent at the Parramatta District Court for the third count on 24 September 2010 is quashed; 

(c) in lieu thereof, the Respondent is sentenced for the third offence, reckless wounding in company, to a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 27 January 2011 and expiring on 26 July 2013, with a balance of term of 18 months commencing 27 July 2013 and expiring on 26 January 2015. 

166The earliest date upon which the Respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 26 July 2013. 

********** 

Addendum 
(12 August 2011) 

1. WHEALY JA, HIDDEN AND JOHNSON JJ : Since judgment in this appeal was published, it has come to the attention of the Court that a number of calculation errors had been made in paragraphs [163] and [165](c) which require amendment under the slip rule. It is common ground as between the Crown and counsel for the Respondent that amendments should be made to those paragraphs to overcome those errors. Amendments have been made to the judgment to reflect this position. 

2. The parties invited the Court to make a further order consequential on the partial success of the Crown appeal. The effect of the orders of the Court made on 25 May 2011 was to quash the sentence imposed for the third offence and to resentence the Respondent for that offence, with the new sentence commencing on 27 January 2011. In the District Court, the sentence for the third offence operated first in time, commencing on 27 April 2009. 

3. As a result of resentencing the Respondent for this offence only, it is necessary to vary the commencement date of the sentence imposed for the fourth offence, so that one of the sentences imposed upon him operates for the entirety of the period covered by the total effective sentence. 

4. It is open to the Court to make an order under s.7(1A)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 varying the sentence imposed for the fourth offence in this way, and the parties invite the Court to do so in this case. The making of such an order is a necessary consequential step in light of the decision of the Court on the Crown appeal. It is appropriate that the Court should make such an order. 

5. Accordingly, in addition to the orders of the Court made on 25 May 2011, an order is made under s.7(1A)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 varying the commencement and expiration dates of the sentence imposed for the fourth offence, so that for that offence, the sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of three years commenced on 27 April 2009 and will expire on 26 April 2012.

2HOEBEN J: 
Offences and sentence

3None of the offences carried standard non-parole periods. 

4On 21 December 2009 his Honour Norrish DCJ sentenced the respondent to a total effective sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years 9 months with a balance of term of 3 years 8 months.

Appeal 

6This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed by his Honour Norrish DCJ at the Sydney District Court on 21 December 2009. 

7The grounds of appeal are as follows: 

"" Ground 1: His honour erred in failing to order an effective degree of partial accumulation, thus resulting in an overall sentence that fails to adequately reflect the totality of the respondent's criminality. 

Ground 2: His Honour failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the pervert the course of justice offences and erred in taking into account that the pervert the course of justice offences did not ultimately result in any miscarriage of justice. 

Ground 3: His Honour erred in imposing an effective total term and effective non-parole period which were manifestly inadequate."" 

Factual background 

8The respondent lived either at Wingham, Taree or Pampoolah in the Manning River area between 1997 and the mid 2000's. He was operating some form of computer business in those locations. 

9The first two complainants, DM and CB, were persons under the age of 16 contemporary with the respondent's son. It would appear that the respondent met these two young men either through his son or through associates of his son. The Crown case was that these two young men were groomed in various ways by the respondent with trips, excursions on a jet-ski and/or cash and accommodation and exposure to pornography on his computer. Both victims were either dysfunctional or from dysfunctional family backgrounds, even before they me the respondent. CB in particular was prone to anti-social behaviour before he came under the respondent's influence. 

10When both these men gave evidence at trial, they were serving substantial sentences of imprisonment. DM had been convicted of a serious crime of violence. CB was serving a lengthy term of imprisonment for the crime of murder. 

11The brothers B were known to the respondent through the respondent's connection to the Taree area. The respondent appears to have known the family generally from earlier contact with an older brother of the complainants. The Crown case in relation to these three complainants was that they became victims of sexual assault by the respondent grooming each of them individually and at separate times with either gifts or trips, excursions on a jet-ski, access to computers with child pornography and cash and treats. 

12There was some dysfunctionality in the B family. The victims of the sexual assaults had lost their mother when they were quite young and it would seem that for a period of time from 2001 until 2006, the respondent had a mentoring role with each of the victims at various times. This was particularly true in relation to SB, who came into the respondent's care with the approval of the Department of Community Services. This gave rise to the circumstances of aggravation in the count 12 and 13 offences being committed while under the authority of the respondent. 

13The respondent had a friendship with MH of a character somewhat similar to his friendship with the brothers B. MH was a contemporary of either DB and/or SB and was part of a group of young men in the Taree/Wingham area who knew the respondent and whom the respondent knew. 

14The evidence at trial revealed that as early as 1997/1998 when the respondent's son was at high school associating with either DM and/or CB, the respondent was known in the Wingham area and possibly elsewhere in the Manning Valley as ""Paedophile Pete"". 

15It would seem that at various times he was equally admired by some of the people with whom he associated, including the victims, and reviled by others by reason of his reputation. Part of the factual matrix was a matter concerning his attendance at a party to pick up his son, where CB and DM were present and a group of youths and perhaps young women attacked his car by throwing bottles at it and screaming abuse at him. 

16As indicated on the indictment, not only were there sexual assault matters involving each of the complainants, but those complainants were protagonists or victims in respect of the offences brought pursuant to s319 Crimes Act 1900 (i.e. the intent to pervert the course of justice offences). 

17A number of those offences related to the recording of statements as to the respondent's good character and lack of sexual intent towards the relevant maker of the statement. Some of these statements were used in proceedings relating to an alleged sexual assault and procuring a person for pornographic purposes which were referred to in the trial as the ""Port Macquarie proceedings"" or the ""Hardcastle trial"". 

18Count 22 was concerned with the calling of evidence in relation to those proceedings. Count 15 was concerned with the recording of observations about the respondent's good character and lack of sexual intent for potential use in these or future proceedings. Two of the counts, contrary to s319, related to proceedings in the Taree Local Court where the respondent, on the Crown case, brought a false allegation against the father of a young boy that he knew, in the nature of a private prosecution for intimidation. One count concerned the calling of a witness to give false evidence, i.e. count 21. This count related to DB. Count 24 concerned an attempt to obtain false evidence from the complainant MH. 

19Count 29, which was in fact the last count in time, was an allegation of attempting to get TB to make false statements for the benefit of the respondent in respect of the proceedings that he was on bail for at the time. 

20No useful purpose would be served by setting out in detail the full circumstances of each count on which the respondent was convicted. It is, however, necessary to briefly summarise each particular offence. 

21Count 1: DM was born in 1983. This count involved an aggravated indecent assault committed when DM stayed at the respondent's home one night in company with the respondent's son. DM woke up and found the respondent touching him on the penis. He was directed to the lounge room and there the respondent masturbated him. 

22Count 2: The respondent drove the victim, in company with two other persons including his son, from Newcastle to Sydney. There was some playing of video games in an arcade and ultimately DM and the other two boys slept at the home of the respondent's mother. DM woke up during the night with the respondent performing oral sex upon him. 

23Count 3: This offence occurred at a lookout tower outside Wingham. The respondent told DM that he wanted to take photographs of him for which purpose DM took off his clothes. The respondent pressed himself against the back of DM and tried to have intercourse with him with his clothes on. 

24Count 4: This offence occurred when the respondent was driving DM from Newcastle to Taree. At a rest stop they got into the back seat where the respondent masturbated himself and kept trying (unsuccessfully) to put his penis into the anus of DM. Ultimately DM got back into the front seat and they drove off. 

25Count 6: This offence involved both DM and CB speaking to the camera. They appear either to be saying lines that they have memorised or are reading from pieces of paper. DM says that he had been making up stories about the respondent and that anything he said about him being a paedophile was untrue. This video was tendered in the ""Port Macquarie proceedings"". 

26Count 7: CB was born in 1982. This offence occurred when CB told the respondent that he was willing to have some pictures taken of him. CB was taken to the lookout and told to pose and to arouse himself. The respondent then took various photographs of him in suggestive poses and gave him money. 

27Counts 12 - 15: SB was born in 1989. When he was in year 9 because of problems at home, he moved into the home of the respondent and came under his authority. In relation to count 12 when SB was asleep in the respondent's home, the respondent repeatedly sexually assaulted him by putting his penis in his anus. Count 13 also occurred when SB was living in the respondent's home. When he was asleep, the respondent came into the room and penetrated him in the anus with his penis. 

28In relation to Count 14, the respondent used a video camera to record SB performing sexual acts with a carrot. These sexual acts included masturbation and placing the carrot in his anus. 

29The Count 15 offence was a recording made in relation to the ""Port Macquarie proceedings"". SB was recorded stating that the respondent had not made sexual advances to him. SB said that he made this recording after threats had been made against him. 

30Count 16: DB was born in 1987. He met the respondent through the respondent's nephew and was groomed by being given access to a computer at the respondent's home. On one of these occasions the respondent rubbed DB's crotch and played with his penis and then put DB's penis in his mouth. 

31Count 17: This count involved anal intercourse, which occurred when the respondent had taken DB to an amusement arcade in Sydney. After attending a fast food restaurant, the respondent and DB went into the back of the car where the offence took place. 

32Count 19: On this occasion the respondent drove DB to a lookout near Taree in the evening. After arriving at the lookout, the respondent asked DB to get into the back of the car and there was an act of penile penetration of his anus. 

33Count 20: At the time of this offence, DB was 15. He had been jet skiing. After washing the jet ski down at the respondent's home, DB was taken to a bedroom where anal intercourse took place. 

34Count 21: This count, which involved evidence being given at the Taree Local Court, involved the respondent persuading DB to falsely state that he had seen an incident when the father of another boy, TR, had used a motor vehicle to try to run over the respondent. DB gave evidence at court that he had seen such an incident. This evidence was false. 

35Count 22: This count related to an attempt by the respondent to persuade DB to give evidence in the ""Port Macquarie proceedings"". DB gave evidence in those proceedings to the effect that he had seen SB and another male, MH, kissing. That evidence was untrue. 

36Count 23: MH was born in 1990. He had met the respondent through another young person. The respondent had offered to take MH wherever he would like to go around the Taree area. In 2003 he was taken to the respondent's house where he was shown a number of pornographic images of young boys. The respondent persuaded him to go to the bathroom and take off his clothes and have a shower. When MH emerged from the shower, the respondent took hold of his penis and masturbated him. 

37Count 24: This count relates to an attempt by the respondent to have MH give false evidence in the Taree Local Court. The respondent promised MH money to sign a statement which was not true. Ultimately MH did not give evidence in those proceedings. 

38Count 25: TB was born in 1991. While at the respondent's home, the respondent persuaded him to take off his shorts and sucked his penis until he ejaculated. 

39Count 26: When TB was 13 the respondent offered him money to visit his home. When he did so he was taken into a bedroom where anal intercourse occurred. 

40Count 27: On this occasion TB was driven to the respondent's home with the offer of the purchase of McDonalds hamburgers. He played on a playstation at the respondent's home during the course of which the respondent sucked his penis until he ejaculated. 

41Count 28: When TB was 14 he was walking to the Aquatic Centre at Taree when the respondent drove up behind him in his motor vehicle. By offering him some McDonald hamburgers, the respondent persuaded him to enter the motor vehicle and go to the respondent's home. While at the home he was shown a pornographic video during the course of which the respondent pulled down his pants and sucked his penis until he ejaculated. 

42Count 29: This offence occurred in February 2009 when the respondent was on bail in relation to allegations made by DB and SB. The respondent approached TB in a supermarket and asked that he record a video saying that the respondent was a good man and that his brothers were liars. The respondent offered TB money to do this. The recording of the video did not take place. 

Remarks on sentence 

43His Honour found that the allegations in Counts 1 - 11 overlapped and were ""very much interrelated"". He also found that the counts 12 to 29 overlapped, particularly when one had regard to the fact that three of the complainants were brothers. 

44In terms of the objective seriousness of the offending, his Honour noted that condign punishment was called for where serious and repeated sexual assaults were perpetrated upon young persons. In this respect his Honour had regard to the comments of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Wicks [2005] NSWCCA 409 at [49]. His Honour also had regard to the differing types of intercourse and to the range of sentences prevalent at the time of their commission. 

45In relation to the counts involving an intent to pervert the course of justice, his Honour had regard to the fact that these attempts were not successful and concluded that this reduced their objective seriousness. 

46His Honour found that the respondent had a weak subjective case. He was born in 1953 and the first offences were committed when he was 44 - 45 years of age. The offending then continued over a significant period of time. He had been married with five children, although he and his wife separated in 1993. He had run an apparently successful computer business until he was taken into custody in 2006. 

47His Honour noted that the respondent had convictions in the early 1970's for minor offences of false pretences. There was no offending between 1972 and 1999 when the respondent was convicted of having goods in custody, reasonably suspected of being stolen. He was placed on a good behaviour bond for 3 years from 12 December 2001. His Honour observed that a number of these offences had occurred whilst he was subject to that good behaviour bond. 

48His Honour also noted that in the ""Port Macquarie proceedings"", the respondent had been convicted of inciting a person under 16 to commit an act of indecency and of procuring a person above the age of 14 years and under the age of 18 years for pornographic purposes. He had received a prison sentence of 18 months which concluded on 11 June 2008. This meant that at the time when the Count 29 offence occurred, he was on parole. 

49His Honour concluded that the respondent's subjective case did not entitle him to any leniency either in relation to the sexual offences or in relation to the offences of acting with intent to pervert the course of justice. 

50His Honour noted that in carrying out the sentencing process, he had to give ""very close attention to what flowed from the High Court decision of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610"". His Honour took into account the need to apply the principles of proportionality and have regard to the totality of the criminality involved when fixing the individual sentences. His Honour also had regard to the need for accumulation, or partial accumulation, in relation to the individual sentences. 

51In relation to the s319 offences, his Honour acknowledged the importance of protecting the integrity of the criminal justice system and that offences contrary to s319 struck at the heart of the justice system. 

52In relation to special circumstances, his Honour said: 

""I have concluded that, essentially, the only true special circumstance that warrants an adjustment of the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of the sentence is the cumulative effect, or partially cumulative effect, of the sentences which I will impose. Many of the sentences I will impose will not require the fixing of a non-parole period at all because of the structure of the sentences."" (ROS 42) 

53His Honour took into account that the respondent was in protection. This meant that his time in custody would involve greater hardship than that experienced by the general prison population. His Honour also noted that the respondent had been previously assaulted when in custody in relation to the ""Port Macquarie proceedings"". His Honour's conclusion was: 

""I accept that by being in protection for whatever reason the prisoner's circumstances will limit his opportunity to get access to particular facilities, including rehabilitation facilities, from time to time and perhaps even medical facilities from time to time but I cannot see any potential hardship even if it could be identified at this point as indicating some special circumstances such as to warrant an adjustment of the non-parole period or to substantially affect the appropriate sentence to be imposed."" (ROS 47) 

54His Honour concluded as follows: 

""I have to have regard to s3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , but in sentencing the prisoner I also have to note that the sentences will be limited by the principles of proportionality and totality and these factors will restrain a sentencing court to some extent in imposing the sentences that are required to promote the purpose of punishment which is obviously implicit in all offences of this type. There can be no doubt, as the Crown and the defence concede, that terms of imprisonment are required for each offence and that the range of period of time over which the offences are committed and the fact that there are different complainants or victims involved in the offences committed at different times, sometimes in circumstances where the prisoner was subject to conditional liberty, must inevitably lead, given some of the comparative sentencing to which I have been referred to sentences of significance."" (ROS 48) 

Appeal 

Ground 1: His Honour erred in failing to order an effective degree of partial accumulation, thus resulting in an overall sentence that failed to adequately reflect the totality of the respondent's criminality. 

Ground 3: His Honour erred in imposing an effective total term and effective non-parole period which were manifestly inadequate. 

55It is appropriate to deal with these two grounds of appeal together since they raise the same issue. 

56The Crown does not raise an issue at to the adequacy of the individual sentences imposed for each count or with the fact of partial accumulation. The essential complaint of the Crown is directed towards the extent of the accumulation. 

57The Crown submits that in this case the imposition of completely concurrent sentences in some instances may be regarded as no sentence at all and thus demonstrates excessive leniency and a failure to reflect the totality of the criminality. In that regard the Crown refers to the fact that 23 offences were committed over a period of 12 years involving 6 victims all of who were juveniles at the time. 

Consideration 

58The relevant principles are clear. In R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302 at [134] Johnson J (with whom Hunt AJA and Latham J agreed) said: 

"" 134 In R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252, the following was said, at 272 [112], concerning questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality: 

""It is necessary to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. The total effective sentence must represent a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved : R v AEM Snr at para 70; R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at 184. The mechanism of making some sentences cumulative and others concurrent (or partly so) may be used where the aggregate of sentences imposed in respect of each count exceeds the appropriate total sentence: R v Myers [2002] NSWCCA 162 at para 34. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice by imposing sentences which do not suggest that multiple offences will be punished in the same way as one or two offences: R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at paras 36-37."" 

135 A paramount principle for the law of sentencing is that the aggregate sentence should fairly and justly reflect the total criminality of the offender's conduct. This principle applies in all cases, including those where punishment is imposed for multiple offences: R v Weldon (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 at 62 [46]. ..."" 

59Similarly in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 Howie J (with whom Adams and Price JJ agreed) said: 

""27 In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both. 

28 This issue was most recently discussed in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 where the Court stated: 

""[11] One of the limiting principles that constrains a sentencing court in seeking to promote the purposes of punishment is the principle of proportionality. Another is the, not-unrelated, principle of totality and it is this principle that operated in the present case. It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 ; Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v R (2004) 78 ALJR 616."" 

[12] In R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245, Street CJ described the principle as follows: (at 260) 

""... The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing Judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing Judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences."" 

... 

That was a case where it was held to be appropriate to impose a sentence completely concurrent with sentences then being served by the offender even though the offence, for which sentence was imposed, was a completely separate and discrete act of serious criminality. 

29 In the present case the Judge, having nominated the sentences for each offence, stated that she proposed to make them partially cumulative in order to achieve the overall sentence that she believed was appropriate. This was in effect a short hand way of indicating that her Honour thought that the totality of criminality encompassed by the three offences warranted a specific sentence that could only be achieved by a degree of cumulation between the three offences. There was nothing more that the Judge needed to say in order to explain why she was structuring the sentences as she did. 

30 In my opinion this ground is not made out. Whether it was open to her Honour to impose partially cumulative sentences depends upon whether it was open to her to assess the totality of criminality of the three sentences as she did. ..."" 

60Applying those principles to the facts of this case makes it clear that these grounds of appeal have not been made out. 

61His Honour was confronted with a difficult sentencing task. The sheer number and seriousness of the offences meant that some degree of concurrency and partial accumulation was inevitable. It also meant that his Honour was required to take into account that a number of the offences were interrelated. 

62The effect of the Crown submissions, both orally and in writing, was that because in many cases the offences were separate and involved different victims, the sentences in respect of those offences could not be concurrent and should be at least partially cumulative. There is, however, no sentencing principle to that effect. What was made clear in Hamid and Cahyadi is that appropriate sentences are to be passed in respect of each offence but then the sentencing judge needs to apply the complementary principles of proportionality and totality in order to formulate a final sentence which is appropriate for the totality of the criminality. As was said by Street CJ in Holder to do otherwise ""will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances"". That is the sort of result which would be achieved if effect were given to the Crown's submissions in this case. To accumulate all of those offences which involved different complainants and different periods of time would produce a total sentence which was crushing. More importantly, it would produce a total sentence which did not adequately reflect the criminality involved. 

63Once a sentencing judge has set individual sentences for each offence, the questions of accumulation and/or concurrence are discretionary matters. It is not a question of what another court or another judge might regard as appropriate, but whether correct principle has been applied in the instant case. As RS Hulme J observed in Qing An v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 53 at [195]: 

""195 ... The issue is what effective total non-parole period and sentence properly reflect the Appellant's criminality and other circumstances. The matter is one where there is no single correct answer and one upon which minds can readily and reasonably differ."" 

The process followed by his Honour of setting discrete sentences for each offence and then determining the overall sentence so as to have regard to proportionality and totality was fully in accord with principle and authority. In any event, the total sentence passed was a not insignificant one. 

64These grounds of appeal have not been made out. 

Ground 2: His Honour failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the pervert the course of justice offences and erred in taking into account that the pervert the course of justice offences did not ultimately result in any miscarriage of justice. 

65The Crown submits that the sentences passed in respect of some of the ""intent to pervert the course of justice"" offences were completely concurrent with other sentences and have to be regarded as no sentence at all. The Crown submits that this indicates excessive leniency in that the maximum sentence for offences contrary to s319 of imprisonment for 14 years was greater than the maximum sentence for any of the sexually related offences for which the respondent was also sentenced. 

66The Crown also submits that his Honour made an error of principle when he took into account that the offences of ""intent to pervert the course of justice"" were ineffective as impacting on the objective seriousness of the offences. In that regard, the Crown relied upon the observation of Hall J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreed) in R v Taylor [2007] NSWCCA 99 at [25]: 

""25 ... Additionally, the fact that the applicant's conduct was thwarted is also of no significance. As Badgery-Parker, J. stated in Regina v Taouk (1992) 65 A. Crim. R. 387 at 392 in the context of an act intended to pervert the course of justice, the fact that the act did not succeed or even was doomed to failure is, as his Honour said, ""of far less significance than in the case of sentencing for an attempt to commit a substantive crime and the potential seriousness of the consequences is of much greater weight"" 

Consideration 

67The second submission of the Crown is undoubtedly correct and his Honour did err in taking into account on the question of objective seriousness, the fact that the acts intended to pervert the course of justice did not succeed. This, however, does not end the matter. 

68Even though his Honour erred in taking that matter into account when assessing objective seriousness, the sentences imposed were still well within the range available and have not been challenged by the Crown. 

69In relation to the Crown's first submission, this raises the same matters which were considered under Grounds of Appeal 1 and 3. In that regard the principles of totality and proportionality apply to ""intent to pervert the course of justice offences"" just as much as they do to other offences. As Hall J said in Taylor at [31]: 

""31 It was, as indicated earlier, essential that the applicant be sentenced for the distinct and separate offences. It was then necessary for the sentencing judge to ensure that the appropriate overall sentence reflected the criminality involved in the offences with the necessary consideration of concurrency or accumulation: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610."" 

70This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

71Accordingly, the order which I propose is that the Crown's appeal against sentence be dismissed. 

72HALL J: I agree with Hoeben J.

		01 June 2011",2011-05-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757063,R v Hawi & ors (No 9) [2011] NSWSC 1655,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: On 23 May 2011 the Commissioner of Police (""the Commissioner"") made a further application for orders that certain civilian eye-witnesses intended to be called by the prosecution be identified only by pseudonyms and that their real names, addresses and any other information that might reveal their identity not be disclosed. 

2Counsel for each of the accused oppose the application. 

3The application is made in respect of 20 of the civilian eye-witnesses. On 29 April 2011 I gave judgment in respect of an application by the Commissioner for the same orders but in respect of all such witnesses: R v Hawi & ors (No 2) . At that stage the Crown Prosecutor informed me that there were some 149 witnesses in this category. The Commissioner's application on that occasion was refused. 

4The nature of the trial and the anticipated issues were described in the earlier judgment. It is unnecessary to repeat that description here. I also there set out, and do not intend to repeat, the history of the manner in which there has been an endeavour to guard against disclosure of the identities of the civilian eye-witnesses up until now. 

5The present application is, in a sense, an extension of the previous application. Exhibits B to G on the previous application were re-tendered in evidence and Mr Bromwich SC who, with Mr Bhalla, appeared for the Commissioner, relied upon the written and oral submissions made on the last occasion, supplemented with some short further oral submissions. 

6Additional material that was placed before the Court on 23 May 2011 comprised an open affidavit by Deputy Commissioner Naguib Kaldas of 20 May 2011 and a confidential affidavit sworn by him on the same date (together with its Exhibit NK-1); the amended Crown Case Statement filed on 6 May 2011; and two statements relating to witnesses referred to in tabs 1 and 2 of Exhibit NK-1. The latter, by necessity, has to be regarded as confidential as disclosure of its contents would disclose material in the confidential affidavit/Exhibit NK-1. 

The previous application 

7In my judgment on the previous application I reviewed at some length the legal issues falling for consideration: public interest immunity; s 130 Evidence Act 1995; and principles of open justice and of a fair trial. It is unnecessary to do so again. 

8The reasons for refusing the previous application may be summarised as follows (the references are all to paragraphs in R v Hawi & ors (No 2) ) . 

9It was accepted on behalf of the Commissioner that the evidence of no individual witness was ""crucial"" to the prosecution. However, as the orders were sought in respect of all of the civilian eye-witnesses, it was that evidence in its entirely that had to be considered. That body of evidence was ""crucial"". I referred to it falling very much at the Davis end of the spectrum of significance of testimony rather than the Murphy end: at [108], referring to R v Davis [2008] UKHL 36; [2008] AC 1128; R v Murphy [1990] NI 306; and BUSB v R [2011] NSWCCA 39. 

10I was not satisfied that there would be any specific and known forensic disadvantage to any of the accused in the event that the orders were made, but I did not discount a possibility, albeit minimal, of their being some disadvantage that counsel were unable to foresee: at [109]. 

11I was considerably concerned about the scope of the application; a departure from open justice principles in respect of a large number of witnesses that was quite without precedent: at [110]. 

12There was a paucity of evidence concerning attempts which had been made to encourage reluctant witnesses to testify, although I acknowledged that the police had adopted a very cautious approach in discussing with witnesses any concerns that they had: at [111]. 

13Whilst a number of witnesses had expressed fears, or concerns, about the possibilities of repercussions if their identities were revealed, it was not suggested that each and every witness had done so: at [112]. I also acknowledged that this was not the only basis upon which the application had been put. There was also an overriding concern held by police in relation to the safety of the witnesses in the present case. Similarly, there was a concern about the prospects of witnesses coming forward in similar cases in the future: at [26] and [112]. 

14Ultimately, I was not satisfied that a case had been made out for the making of an order that extended to each and every civilian witness; that is, even including witnesses who reside overseas and witnesses who had not expressed any concern at all: at [113] - [114]. 

15In the case of those witnesses who had expressed some concern, what had been provided, in the main, was brief and in general terms. In many cases it was confined to the quotation of one or two sentences uttered by a witness: at [115]. 

16I accepted a submission made on behalf of the accused Hawi that if any pseudonym order was to be considered, it should be done on a witness-by-witness basis. I indicated that there would need to be a far more detailed explanation of the need for an order in relation to particular witnesses than that which had at that stage been provided: at [116]. 

17For these reasons, I concluded that the public interest in the accused having a fair trial in accordance with open justice principles was not outweighed by the public interest in preserving the anonymity of all of the civilian eye-witnesses: at [117]. 

Events since the previous judgment 

18After the delivery of that judgment, police undertook the task of contacting every one of the civilian eye-witnesses. I am satisfied that this was done in a very careful and sensitive way in order not to create fears or concerns in witnesses where no such fears or concerns were held, or to elevate the level of any fears or concerns that were held. The contact was in the nature of a routine call to organise for the attendance of witnesses to give evidence at the trial. There was no discussion about previous applications by the Commissioner for pseudonym orders at the committal hearing or in this Court unless the topic was first raised by the witness. The witnesses were informed that there was a need to give their names at the commencement of their evidence. Any reaction to that information was recorded in writing. If any fears or concerns were expressed, further questions were asked in a non-leading fashion about their nature and extent. 

19A number of the witnesses who had been contacted up until the swearing of Mr Kaldas' affidavits on 20 May 2011 expressed fears and concerns both about giving evidence and about revealing their identities. What was said by the 20 witnesses who are the subject of the present application is set out in Mr Kaldas' confidential affidavit. Concern was expressed in the submissions of some counsel for the accused about this material being confidential. However, as Mr Bromwich submitted, disclosure of those responses in a number of cases would involve disclosure of material of an identifying nature. 

20Mr Kaldas also deposes that fears and concerns were expressed by a number of witnesses who were not the subject of the present application. There is the suggestion that it would be inappropriate to disclose the identities of such witnesses a significant time before they give their evidence because of the possibility that the concerns of the witnesses may be elevated as the time approaches for them to attend court, and it may be the case that an application will be made in respect of further witnesses at a later time. That is a matter that I do not need to be concerned about in determining the present application. 

21The submissions by counsel for the accused in opposition to the Commissioner's application were largely similar to those that were made on 21 April 2011 in response to the previous application. I will only indicate a response to them where there was an added dimension to them. 

22There was reference to the application being unprecedented in terms of the number of witnesses in respect of whom it was concerned. That is a matter about which I expressed concern in my previous judgment. 

23Reference was made to the inadvertent disclosure by the police of identifying information in respect of some of the witnesses, the point being made that there was no evidence that any of those witnesses had been the subject of any inappropriate contact. An additional aspect of that matter is that it is one of the specific matters that I am required to take into account: s 130(5)(e) Evidence Act 1995. 

24There was reiteration of the point that the evidence of the witnesses was, in effect, ""locked in"", in that they had all made statements and many had given evidence at the committal hearing. As a result, if any witness did not give evidence in accordance with what was expected of them, the Crown could have recourse to the provisions of s 38 of the Evidence Act . 

25Submissions were made about the lack of any need, or at least the unlikelihood of any need, for witnesses who reside overseas to require any protective measures. 

26It was submitted that it was possible that the police themselves were generating fears and concerns by the nature of their contact with the witnesses. Mr Bromwich responded to this by submitting that this was far from the case as it is not in the interests of the police at all to be dissuading witnesses from giving evidence. That response, with respect, is logical and reflects common sense. 

27It was submitted that the Court should undertake the task of examining each of the witnesses individually. Understandably, that was a submission made without knowledge of the contents of the confidential affidavits. I do not consider that it is necessary for that course to be undertaken and I have considerable reservations about how it could be practical to do so. 

28Mr Driels made the point that there was, to his knowledge, nothing to indicate that any witness had any reasonable and genuine fear of his client, Mr Potrus, as opposed to the group with which he was associated, that is, the Comanchero motorcycle club. The submission was that it was Mr Potrus on trial, not the Comanchero. It is true to say that none of the witnesses have expressed any fear or concern about an individual accused. However, there are fears and concerns about the accused generally because of the clubs with which they are associated. 

29The situation appears to be the same as it was on the previous occasion in terms of any challenge to the evidence of the civilian witnesses being upon the basis of their accuracy and reliability as opposed to their credibility in terms of honesty. None of the witnesses were acquainted with any of the accused. The situation is far removed from that which was the case in some of the authorities referred to in my previous judgment such as Davis , above. 

30The primary concern appears to remain, that being the potential for prejudice if the jury were aware that some of the witnesses were not being identified in court by their own name. Some counsel have expressed the view that the jury should be told at an early stage by way of some appropriate direction. Other counsel took the view that no direction could cure the prejudice. 

31I announced on 24 May 2011 that I would grant the application in respect of 5 of the 20 witnesses. Prior to making my opening remarks to the jury on 25 May 2011, there was further debate amongst counsel on the question of whether a direction should be given, and if so, in what terms. There was no unanimity on the subject. In the end, I resolved that it would be appropriate that I say something in brief terms to the jury during the course of my opening remarks. In my view it was appropriate that the jury be informed so as to avoid any embarrassing complication in the event there was an inadvertent slip later on. It was appropriate to do so in my opening remarks rather than at some other time so as to avoid giving the issue prominence. What I said to the jury seemed to be acceptable to most counsel after an amendment to what I had proposed to say that was helpfully suggested by Mr Young SC. 

32I indicated on 24 May 2011 that I was satisfied that the fears and concerns expressed by each of the witnesses who had been spoken to by police were reasonably and genuinely held. However, I remained of the view I had indicated in my previous judgment that there was a possibility that the concerns of some witnesses, at least, could possibly be placated by further discussion with the police. I understand that the police have not engaged in such discussions to date because of the care and sensitivity with which they have approached the subject with all of the witnesses. 

33In respect of five of the witnesses, however, there was an additional element which I felt warranted the granting of the application. It would be inappropriate for me to set out the detail in this judgment except to say that I am satisfied that these five witnesses are, in my view, particularly vulnerable because of circumstances personal to them. The reasons for that view are based upon material in Mr Kaldas' confidential affidavit of 20 May 2011. 

34I announced in court on 24 May 2011 that the application of the Commissioner was granted in respect of five of the witnesses. On 26 May 2011 I announced the orders made as a consequence. Those announcements were in the following terms. 

Orders 

35I grant the application in respect of the witnesses identified by the numbers 98, 99, 132, 245 and 247. The application is refused in respect of the other witnesses. 

36I make the following orders, the first being a reiteration of that which I made on 24 May 2011: 

1. There shall be no publication of any evidence, submissions or references in court, or information derived therefrom, in respect of the application. 

2. The true names of the witnesses identified by the numbers 98, 99, 132, 245 and 247 are not to be adduced in evidence or otherwise disclosed in the course of these proceedings. 

3. The witnesses referred to in order 2 are to give evidence in these proceedings under pseudonyms. 

4. There shall be no publication or other disclosure of any matter that is likely to lead to the identification of the witnesses referred to in order 2.

		09 February 2012",2011-05-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757073,R v Smith [No 1] [2011] NSWSC 725,"Judgment 

Introduction 
1The applicant, Darren Paul Smith, is charged with having murdered Russell Lyons at Fairfield on 3 June 1995. On 26 May 2011 I refused the applicant's notice of motion seeking a permanent stay of the proceedings. What follows were my reasons for doing so. 

2A considerable body of material has been tendered on the application. The applicant relies upon two affidavits of his instructing solicitor, Melissa Chu, sworn 27 April and 6 May 2011 respectively. Annexed to those affidavits are a number of documents which concern the investigation and prosecution of this matter. They include witness statements, transcripts of evidence given at the committal hearing, and other material such as police running sheets, COPS entries and information reports. In response, the Crown provided material in the form of further witness statements and newspaper clippings. The hearing has proceeded in a somewhat piecemeal fashion. That was largely because it was necessary for a good deal of additional evidence to be adduced by the parties so that matters, which had been raised for the first time in written submissions filed on behalf of the Crown, could be addressed. Subsequently, in response to a further matter raised by the Crown, leave was granted to the applicant to cross-examine two witnesses on a Basha enquiry. In the final analysis, oral evidence was given by Detective Senior Constable David Willey, who has been the officer in charge of the investigation since July 2008, by Senior Constable Geoffrey Connelly and by two civilian witnesses, Brett Kennedy and Paul Johnson. 

3Put shortly, the application is brought upon the basis that the applicant has been deprived of the opportunity of having a fair trial because of what is said to have been an inadequate police investigation, which included the failure to promptly investigate information that two persons had separately claimed responsibility for killing the deceased, together with the loss or destruction of physical exhibits and other documents. In written submissions the issue was described in the following terms: 

A combination of the lapse of time, loss of information/evidence and an absence of due diligence in the police investigation of this matter create such prejudice as to render any trial of the accused an abuse of process"". 

The Crown case 

4I was provided by the Crown with a document entitled ""Short Summary of the Crown Case"" which is in the following terms: 

The Crown puts its case against the accused (in the usual way) by firstly asserting that the accused deliberately caused the death of the deceased; with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm upon him; and not by way of acting in self-defence. 

In the alternative the Crown puts its case against the accused by way of the application of the constructive murder rule. The Crown says that the accused committed the crime of aggravated steal from the person with the infliction of grievous bodily harm, contrary to s.96 of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty upon conviction is 25 years imprisonment). 

The particulars of which are that the accused: 



stole the wallet, keys and shoes of Russell Lyons, from the person of Russell Lyons, 

and immediately before or after, or at the time of the theft he used corporal violence on Russell Lyons 

and thereby inflicted grievous bodily harm on Russell Lyons. 

The Crown alleges that at about 3.30am on 3 June 1995, Darren Paul Smith (the accused) was involved in an altercation with Russell Lyons (the deceased) on The Crescent at Fairfield. The Crown alleges that the accused attempted to steal the wallet of Russell Lyons. Almost immediately thereafter three unidentified Pacific Islander men and two male friends of the deceased became involved. The accused was kicked and the deceased was punched by one of the Pacific Islanders. 

The Crown alleges that the deceased run [sic] from the scene along The Crescent and around the corner into Smart Street and then into a car park located at the end of the laneway that intersected with Smart Street. The Crown alleges that the accused chased the deceased, caught up with him in the car park and assaulted him knocking him to the ground. Due to his level of intoxication, the deceased was unable to escape the area and the accused beat him causing his head to strike the ground. The Crown also alleges the accused kicked the head of the deceased, whilst the deceased was lying face down on the ground. The accused inflicted the head injury that caused the death of Russell Lyons. 

The Crown alleges the accused removed deceased's wallet from the rear right pocket of his jeans and also removed the deceased's size 10 white Asics joggers and placed them on his own feet after removing his size 9 Adidas joggers. The accused threw his Adidas shoes on a nearby awning. The Crown asserts those shoes were worn by the accused [sic] have contacted with blood from the injuries inflicted upon the deceased. 

Those Adidas shoes were seized by police. Blood stains were detected on the external surface of the heel of the right shoe and on the side of the sole of the left shoe. The DNA profile recovered from these blood stains is consistent with the DNA profile of the deceased. An unidentified male DNA profile was obtained from the inside of the tongue of the left shoe. Further analysis in 2009 of these Adidas shoes detected the same DNA profile from the inside heel area of the right and left shoes. DNA was also recovered from one inner sole and the shoe laces. This DNA showed a mixture of DNA types originating from at least 3 unidentified individuals. 

The same unidentified male DNA profile (obtained from the inside the shoes) was obtained from an examination of a stain above the right back pocket of the deceased's jeans, the pocket in which the deceased kept his wallet. 

For over a decade police inquiries into the murder of Russell Lyons were unsuccessful. 

On 28 July 2007 the accused provided a DNA sample following his arrest in Queensland. On 23 September 2008 the previously unidentified male DNA profile located on the inside of the left Adidas shoe was matched on the National Criminal Identification DNA Database (NCIDD) with the DNA profile of accused. 

The accused was arrested and charged on 7 June 2009. 

The Crown also relies upon the evidence of a forensic podiatrist (Dr Paul Bennett) who compared the wear patterns on the Adidas shoes referred to above with the accused's workboots and thongs taken by police after his arrest. The Crown asserts that the wear patterns on the accused's workboots and thongs correspond to wear patterns on the Adidas shoes. [I interpolate that it has been foreshadowed that the admissibility of that evidence will be challenged in the event that the present application fails]. 

The Crown also relies on: 

(1) evidence of the similarity between the appearance of the accused in 1995 with the description of the man who attempted to steal the deceased's wallet and who pursued the deceased into Smart Street; 

(2) evidence that the accused lived and worked in the Fairfield area in June 1995. 

5Counsel who appeared for the applicant, Ms Yehia SC, in written submissions, produced a rather more comprehensive summary of the available material in order to place the application into some sort of context. That summary is reproduced below: 

The deceased's body was found on the morning of 3 June 1995 in a car park area at the end of a laneway running off Smart Street Fairfield. He did not have his shoes on. The pathologist's report states that the direct cause of death was head injury with alcohol toxicity being a contributing factor. 

The deceased had been out the night before with a group of friends. At about 3 am on 3 June 1995, the deceased was in the company of John Byrne and Ian Cross. They were on The Crescent, Fairfield. 

Ian Cross and John Byrne made a number of statements to police setting out their accounts of what had occurred in the early hours of 3 June 1995. Both witnesses also gave evidence at the Inquest in 2000 and at committal proceedings in 2010. 

Essentially, these two witnesses give an account of seeing a Caucasian male and the deceased in what appeared to be a confrontation. They heard the deceased call out words to the effect that the Caucasian male had the deceased's wallet or was trying to steal his wallet. Byrne and Cross ran towards the Caucasian male and the deceased. Cross struck the Caucasian male causing him to the fall to the ground. 

The witnesses gave a general description of the Caucasian male. The male was observed to have a 'goatee' beard. The Crown case is that this male is the accused. 

At about the time this initial confrontation was taking place, the witnesses observed three males described as 'Islander males' approach from the direction of Hamilton Street. These three Islanders asked what was going on. One of the Islanders struck the deceased and then struck the Caucasian male. 

According to Byrne the deceased then ran down the Crescent and around the corner into Smart Street. He saw the Caucasian male also run around the corner into Smart Street but is unsure as to whether he did so before or after the deceased. That was the last that Byrne saw of the deceased. [I should indicate that in his statement to police Mr Byrne said that when he saw the deceased starting to run (that is around the corner) he saw the other man ""run after"" him. However, his evidence in that respect must be regarded as equivocal, given the versions he gave on subsequent occasions]. 

Cross observed one of the three islanders assault the deceased and the Caucasian male. Once struck the Caucasian male disappeared. Cross observed one of the Islander males assault the deceased on a second occasion at the corner of The Crescent and Smart Street. He observed the Islander to be 'belting into' the deceased. 

Both Cross and Byrne were approached by the Islanders again. Byrne was assaulted and they then managed to walk away from the Islander males. The Islander observed to assault the deceased was described as having braided hair (possibly in a pony tail). 

On the 5 June 1995 a pair of Adidas joggers were found on an awning at 113 The Crescent. Between 1995 and 2008 the Adidas shoes were subject to numerous forensic tests including multiple DNA tests. In total 5 separate DNA profiles were located on the shoes. One of the profiles matching the deceased's DNA profile was located in bloodstains on the shoes. The unidentified DNA profiles found elsewhere on the shoes were entered into the DNA database. 

On 23 September 2008 one of the DNA profiles found on the inside tongue of the left shoe was linked on the National database with the profile of the accused. Following his arrest, a reference buccal sample was taken from the accused and further DNA testing was conducted on the shoes and on the jeans worn by the deceased. A DNA profile found on the upper inside heel of both shoes was matched to the DNA profile of the accused. A DNA profile taken from a stain above the right back pocket of the deceased's jeans matched the DNA profile of the accused. 

The accused has been excluded as a contributor to three DNA profiles found elsewhere on the Adidas shoes (inside toe area of right shoe, inner sole and shoelaces). 

The Crown relies upon the DNA evidence in presenting a circumstantial case alleging that it was this accused who robbed the deceased, causing him fatal injuries with an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or, alternatively relying on constructive murder. 

Central to the Crown case is the evidence of the Adidas shoes and the link the Crown makes between the wearer of those shoes and the commission of the offence. 

The police investigation into this matter, before September 2008, focused on a number of suspects who either fit the description of the Islander men or were associates of Islander men known to police in the Fairfield area in 1995. 

Yakup 'Cookie"" Tomruk, his brother Michael, and associates Beaven, Walsh and Hakalo were all nominated as suspects in 1995. Police received information nominating Yakup Tomruk as early as 6pm on 5 June 1995. 

On 22 September 1999 John Brown aka Jose Bachar was interviewed by police in relation to a number of suspects including Jack and Michael Rai. The witness described an islander male that used to associate with the Rai brothers in 1995 as having a Samoan, big build with 'a long pony tail...I think braided'. He told police that on the evening of the 3 June 1995 he was outside an establishment called Smarties with a group of islanders. He saw the male he described as the Samoan with the ponytail wearing a pair of shoes that he thought were Nikes. This male was talking about the deceased and saying that the shoes belonged to the deceased. 

At the committal hearing the witness claimed that he did not know Jack and Michael Rai. Furthermore he said that someone had offered him money to give his earlier account to police. However, his account to police in 1999 included a description of the Islander as having a ponytail, possibly braided. This detail was not part of any description that was made public in newspaper articles or television programmes about the death. 

Among the suspects were a group of associates: Yakup Tomruk, his brother Michael Tomruk, Paul Beaven, David Hakalo and Keith Walsh. Yakup Tomruk was interviewed by police on 6 June 1995 and 15 October 1999. Paul Beaven was interviewed by police on 15 April 1998 and 27 August 2001. David Hakalo was interviewed on 15 April 1998, 23 September 1999 and 14 August 2001. Keith Walsh was interviewed on 7 April 1998, 18 August 1999, 23 September 1999 and 7 September 2001. Each of the suspects denied involvement in the offence. 

The relevant legal principles 

6It is convenient to make reference to the general principles which are to be applied when a court is requested to grant a permanent stay. 

7In Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23, Mason CJ said: 

To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial ""of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences"": Barton , per Wilson J.[at 34] 

8Brennan J said: 

The power which was acknowledged to exist in Barton is a power which has a dual purpose: ""to prevent an abuse of process or the prosecution of a criminal proceeding in a manner which will result in a trial which is unfair when judged by reference to accepted standards of justice"". One purpose of the power is to ensure a fair trial, the other to prevent an abuse of process. A power to ensure a fair trial is not a power to stop a trial before it starts. It is a power to mould the procedures of the trial to avoid or minimize prejudice to either party. ... 

Unfairness occasioned by circumstances outside the court's control does not make the trial a source of unfairness. When an obstacle to a fair trial is encountered, the responsibility cast on a trial judge to avoid unfairness to either party but particularly to the accused is burdensome, but the responsibility is not discharged by refusing to exercise the jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues. The responsibility is discharged by controlling the procedures of the trial by adjournments or other interlocutory orders, by rulings on evidence and, especially, by directions to the jury designed to counteract any prejudice which the accused might otherwise suffer. ... 

By the flexible use of the power to control procedure and by the giving of forthright directions to a jury, a judge can eliminate or virtually eliminate unfairness. The judge's responsibilities are heavy but they are not discharged by abdication of the court's duty to try the case. If it be said that judicial measures cannot always secure perfect justice to an accused, we should ask whether the ideal of perfect justice has not sounded in rhetoric rather than in law and whether the legal right of an accused, truly stated, is a right to a trial as fair as the courts can make it. Were it otherwise, trials would be prevented and convictions would be set aside when circumstances outside judicial control impair absolute fairness. [at 46-47, 49] 

9In Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509, Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ in a joint judgment, said: 

It is well established that Australian superior courts have inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings which are an abuse of process. ... 

The jurisdiction to grant a stay of a criminal prosecution has a dual purpose, namely, ""to prevent an abuse of process or the prosecution of a criminal proceeding ... which will result in a trial which is unfair"". This does not mean that the prosecution of proceedings in such a way as to make them an instrument of oppression which will result in an unfair trial stands outside the concept of abuse of process. That term has been applied on various occasions to describe the situation just mentioned as well as the more traditional case where the prosecution is brought for an improper purpose. 

However, in the light of the particular object sought to be achieved by an exercise of the jurisdiction in each class of case, it is important to distinguish between them. If a permanent stay is sought to prevent the accused from being subjected to an unfair trial, it is only natural that the court should refrain from granting a stay unless it is satisfied that an unfair trial will ensue unless the prosecution is stayed. In other words, the court must be satisfied that there are no other available means, such as directions to be given by the trial judge, of bringing about a fair trial. Jago was such a case. Consequently, the judgments in that case gave emphasis to the necessity that the court should satisfy itself upon this point before granting the relief sought. 

If, however, a stay is sought to stop a prosecution which has been instituted and maintained for an improper purpose, it by no means follows that it is necessary, before granting a stay, for the court to satisfy itself in such a case that an unfair trial will ensue unless the prosecution is stopped. There are some policy considerations which support the view that the court should so satisfy itself. It is of fundamental importance that, unless the interests of justice demand it, courts should exercise, rather than refrain from exercising, their jurisdiction, especially their jurisdiction to try persons charged with criminal offences, and that persons charged with such offences should not obtain an immunity from prosecution . It is equally important that freedom of access to the courts should be preserved and that litigation of the principal proceeding, whether it be criminal or civil, should not become a vehicle for abuse of process issues on an application for a stay, unless once again the interests of justice demand it. In the United States, great weight has been given to these factors. 

These factors have considerable force. There is a risk that the exercise of the jurisdiction to grant a stay may encourage some defendants to seek a stay on flimsy grounds for tactical reasons. But that risk and the other policy considerations already mentioned are not so substantial as to outweigh countervailing policy considerations and deter the courts from exercising the jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances. ... 

It is, of course, well established that the onus of satisfying the court that there is an abuse of process lies upon the party alleging it. The onus is ""a heavy one ""... and the power to grant a permanent stay is one to be exercised only in the most exceptional circumstances . [at pp 518-19, 529] [footnotes omitted] [emphasis added] 

10In Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in a joint judgment said: 

The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness. ... 

In Jago v. District Court of New South Wales , at least three of the five members of the Court clearly rejected ""the narrower view"" that a court's power to protect itself from an abuse of process in criminal proceedings ""is limited to traditional notions of abuse of process"". Mason CJ considered that a court, ""whose function is to dispense justice with impartiality and fairness both to the parties and to the community which it serves"", possesses the necessary power to prevent its processes being employed in a manner which gives rise to unfairness. His Honour quoted, with approval, the following remarks of Richardson J of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Moevao v. Department of Labour : 

""public interest in the due administration of justice necessarily extends to ensuring that the Court's processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. And the due administration of justice is a continuous process, not confined to the determination of the particular case. It follows that in exercising its inherent jurisdiction the Court is protecting its ability to function as a Court of law in the future as in the case before it. This leads on to the second aspect of the public interest which is in the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice. It is contrary to the public interest to allow that confidence to be eroded by a concern that the Court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice."" ... 

As was pointed out in Jago , the question whether criminal proceedings should be permanently stayed on abuse of process grounds falls to be determined by a weighing process involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors and considerations. Among those factors and considerations are the requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice . [at pp 392-6] [footnotes omitted] [emphasis added] 


11In Subramaniam v R (2004) 211 ALR 1, the High Court said: 

In Jago v District Court (NSW) Brennan J cautioned against too ready a disposition to grant stays : 

""The reasons for granting stay orders, which are as good as certificates of immunity, would be difficult of explanation for they would be largely discretionary. If permanent stay orders were to become commonplace, it would not be long before courts would forfeit public confidence . The granting of orders for permanent stays would inspire cynicism, if not suspicion, in the public mind."" 

It may now also be accepted however that the categories of factual situations which may call for a consideration of the possibility of abuse of process in criminal proceedings are not closed. ... 

Fairness or unfairness has been said to defy ""analytical definition"" and to ""involve an undesirably, but unavoidably, large content of essentially intuitive judgment"" [at paras 25-27] [footnotes omitted] [emphasis added] 

12In PNJ v R (2009) 252 ALR 612, the High Court said: 

It is not possible to describe exhaustively what will constitute an abuse of process. It may be accepted, however, that many cases of abuse of process will exhibit at least one of three characteristics: 

(a) the invoking of a court's processes for an illegitimate or collateral purpose; 

(b) the use of the court's procedures would be unjustifiably oppressive to a party; or 

(c) the use of the court's procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. [at para 3] 

13In Dupas v The Queen (2010) 241 CLR 237 the High Court said: 

In Glennon , in describing cases in which a permanent stay will be ordered as extreme, Mason CJ and Toohey J refer back to a passage in Jago v District Court (NSW) ) containing a reference to R v McLoughlin; Ex parte Director of Prosecutions . There, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland recognized that for a court to grant a permanent stay of criminal proceedings is a rare occurrence, a drastic remedy to be applied in exceptional cases which might arise if there had been some conduct on the part of a prosecuting authority shown to result in prejudice to an accused in obtaining a fair trial. 
... 

Characterising a case as extreme or singular is to recognize the rarity of a situation in which the unfair consequences of an apprehended defect in a trial cannot be relieved against by the trial judge during the course of a trial. There is no definitive category of extreme cases in which a permanent stay of criminal proceedings will be ordered. In seeking to apply the relevant principle in Glennon , the question to be asked in any given case is not so much whether the case can be characterised as extreme, or singular, but rather, whether an apprehended defect in a trial is ""of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trail can relieve against its unfair consequences."" 
... 

A further consideration is the need to take into account the substantial public interest of the community in having those who are charged with criminal offences brought to trial, the ""social imperative"" as Nettle JA called it, as a permanent stay is tantamount to a continuing immunity from prosecution. Because of this public interest, fairness to the accused is not the only consideration bearing on a court's decision as to whether a trial should proceed . [at paras 33, 35, 37] [emphasis added] 

14Given the issues which have been raised in the present case, it will be necessary to refer to some other authorities which assume particular significance. In R v Helmling (NSWCCA, unreported, 11 November 1993) the applicant was charged with three offences of culpable driving after the horse float which he was driving allegedly crossed onto the incorrect side of the road and collided with a truck coming in the opposite direction. As a result of the collision, the driver of the truck died and a passenger in each of the vehicles was occasioned grievous bodily harm. Hunt CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, addressed the basis upon which an application for permanent stay was advanced in the following terms: 

There was also evidence before the judge that, in the clothing of the deceased driver of the truck, there was found a disposable syringe and two small bags containing while powder or traces thereof which on analysis contained the drug methylamphetamine and, in the cabin of the truck, there was found a capsule which on analysis contained the drug phenamine. A sample was taken of the deceased's blood, but it was lost before it could be analysed, as a result of a system for which the prosecution must accept the blame. The syringe was never examined. The post mortem examination did, however, disclose that the deceased was suffering from both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C which, it was asserted, are often occasioned by intravenous drug use. There is nothing before us as to whether the deceased was found on post mortem to have track marks on his arms. 

The applicant sought the stay of proceedings in the District Court upon the basis that the loss of this blood sample denied to him proof of a fundamental issue which he wished to establish, that the deceased was affected by the ingestion of drugs at the time of the collision, thus giving rise to the inference, it was submitted, that the truck driven by the deceased was the vehicle on its incorrect side at the time of the collision. The submission was that such loss amounted to a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial of such a nature that nothing which the trial judge could do in the conduct of the trial could relieve the applicant against its unfair consequences. [at pp 3-4] 

15His Honour said that he ""[did] not accept that the case is of such an extreme nature as to warrant the grant of a stay"" (at p8). His Honour's reasons for arriving at that conclusion appear in the following passages: 

That leads me to the consequences to the applicant of the loss by the prosecution of the deceased's blood sample . Clearly, if the applicant had available to him an analysis of that blood, he may have been somewhat further forward in raising this issue on the evidence for the Crown to eliminate. Whether or not he would have been further forward depends upon two further issues. The first is whether an analysis could have demonstrated that the deceased had in fact injected such an overdose of those drugs as to lead to the inference that there is a reasonable possibility that the deceased was so affected by that injection as to have allowed his truck to move onto his incorrect side of the road. ... 

The second issue, however, is whether such an analysis would have established that the deceased had in fact injected a sufficient dosage of the drugs as to give rise to such an inference. In my opinion, that too is sheer speculation. It is not like the case where, after a delay for which the prosecution was responsible, an accused can claim injustice from the death of a witness where that witness had made a statement of the evidence which he or she could give. We simply do not know what this blood would have shown, and there is such just as much chance that it would have shown nothing at all as the contrary. On the other hand, upon the assumption that the applicant is able to produce the further evidence to which I earlier referred, the applicant will have the advantage, without the blood, of being able to say to the jury at least that it may have established sufficient injection of the drugs to lead to the relevant inference. Whether or not that evidence is available has simply not been investigated. 

What the applicant has lost therefore is the chance that he may have been able to do better; he has not lost the certainty that he would have done better. He had been permanently deprived of an opportunity simply to explore an avenue of inquiry which might have led to his acquittal. That may in some cases be sufficient, but they would in my view be rare. They would not usually produce the extreme situation which the authorities require . ...[at pp 7-8] [emphasis added] 

16In R v Tolmie (unreported, NSWCCA, 7 December 1994) Hunt CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the court agreed, in allowing a Crown appeal against a decision to grant a permanent stay, observed: 

There are many cases in which this Court has held that a permanent stay should not be granted simply because witnesses are unavailable or lost: Regina v George Adler (CCA, 11 June 1992, unreported) at 2-4; Regina v Anthony Richard Goldburg (CCA, 23 February 1993) at 4-6; Regina v Laurie Peter Hemling (at 4-8); Regina v David Anthony McCarthy (CCA, 12 August 1994, unreported) at 11-13. It is unnecessary to discuss them all yet again. In those cases, it was known what evidence could be given by the missing witness, and that the accused suffered some prejudice as a result of its loss. In the present case, there is nothing known of what evidence - if any - these two witnesses could have given. It is entirely speculative that they could give any evidence at all which was relevant to the issue of identification, let alone that the respondent will suffer some prejudice as a result of its loss. [at 5] 

To similar effect see R v Carver [1999] NSWCCA 135. 

17In R v Hatfield [1999] NSWCCA 340 the accused was charged in 1997 with having murdered her husband in 1985. The evidence revealed that a number of items had been lost by police. They included the clothing worn by both the accused and the deceased, as well as other items which appear to have been associated with the deceased, the firearm which may have been used to kill the deceased, and notes of counselling sessions conducted with an essential Crown witness to whom the accused is alleged to have made admissions. Hulme J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 

Remarks of Gleeson CJ in R v McCarthy & Ors (unreported CCA, 12 August 1994) are also apposite:- 

"" Time and time again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as important by one side or the other die, or become ill, or lose their memory, or lose documents . If the result of that were that nobody could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the problems of delay in the criminal lists in this State. However, the position is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need to be stayed . In this connection I refer to what was said in R v Adler (unreported CCA, 11 June 1992) and R v Goldberg (unreported CCA, 23 February 1993)."" 
... 

Although I have recognised that prejudice to the Applicant may have occurred in consequence of the loss of at least some material, it does not follow that any trial will be unfair. This is not a perfect world. Sometimes crimes are not discovered until long after they have occurred; and as the passages quoted from R v Tolmie and T v McCarthy make clear, not infrequently some items of evidence or witnesses will not be available . Some assessment of the significance of not only the unavailable, but also of the available, evidence is required. ... 

The circumstances that a stay will only be granted where there exists a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial ""of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences""; and that the remedy is discretionary, mean that account must also be taken of the powers available to a trial Judge to eliminate or reduce the risk of unfairness. ... 

The use of these powers is likely to ensure that the Crown gains no unfair advantage from evidence relating to the missing firearm, clothing etc. Of course, the powers are unlikely to cure the absence of any evidence which would tend to exculpate the Applicant. I have largely dealt with that latter topic; but it must not be forgotten that the lateness of complaint in many sexual assault matters is calculated to preclude the possibility of any alibi evidence being available to an accused and yet the approach of the Courts has not been to stay all such actions. [at paras 17, 38, 42 - 43] [emphasis added] 

18In R v Ngo (2003) 57 NSWLR 55, albeit in a different context, the Court said: 

In Jarvie v Magistrates' Court (Vic) [1995] 1 VR 84, the appeal concerned the anonymity of undercover police operatives. The court held that a balancing exercise must be undertaken between aspects of the public interest, including the entitlement of an accused to a fair trial. 

Brooking J observed however that a fair trial did not mean a perfect trial, ""free from possible detriment or disadvantage of any kind or degree to the accused""; see also Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23, R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 and Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292. [at paras 98-9] 

19In R v Ulman-Naruniec (2003) 143 A Crim R 531, a stay was sought on the basis that there had been both ""an inexcusable failure"" on the part of the prosecution to provide the applicant with ""material fundamental to her defence of the charge"", and because there was evidence that was ""no longer available"". Bleby J, with whom Besanko J agreed (Sulan J dissenting) said: 

I am not aware of any case where a stay has been granted on a ground of abuse of process because evidence, not shown to be essential to the defence case, merely might contain something of some assistance or might promote some relevant line of inquiry. If that were the case, many a prosecution might be stayed because of some failure on the part of police to investigate a particular 
line of inquiry that cannot later be pursued. ... 

Defective as the handling of the police investigation may have been in this case, I do not consider that the complaint of lack of access to the material in question would justify the extreme step of a permanent stay. The accused can put it no higher than that there is just a possibility that some of the lost material may be of some assistance . ... 

In my opinion, on the evidence in this case and on the findings of the trial Judge, it was not ""on the cards"" that the missing material would be likely to assist the defence. The evidence did not go as far as that. Any deficiencies in the investigation which might raise a doubt on the prosecution case will no doubt be exploited before the jury and, if appropriate, may be the subject of comment by the Judge . I do not consider that the lack of access to this material either alone or taken in combination with the matters which follow, would justify a permanent stay on the ground of abuse of process in accordance with the principles explained in Jago . [at paras 37, 39, 42] [emphasis added] 


20In R v Fleming [2007] NSWSC 337, the applicant was charged in January 2005 for a murder which he was alleged to have committed in February 1984. The applicant submitted that he was prejudiced by the extreme delay and, in particular, because he was unable to obtain witnesses and/or records to support his alibi. Studdert J, in refusing the application, observed: 

In submissions counsel referred me to no case in which a court in this State has ordered a stay of proceedings because of the loss of potential witnesses, although it is to be accepted, of course, that a trial can be rendered unfair where evidence has been lost through the effluxion of time. I was referred to R v Adler (unreported, NSWCCA, 11 June 1992). In that case a witness potentially able to corroborate the accused died before trial and neither at trial nor on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was it considered that the loss of this witness warranted a permanent stay in relation to the substantive offences. I was referred also R v Goldburg (unreported, NSWCCA, 23 February 1993). This was a case in which an alibi witness was lost to an accused through ill health. An application for a permanent stay was refused at trial and on appeal. In his judgment in Goldburg , Mahoney JA, with whose judgment Gleeson CJ and Abadee J agreed, acknowledged that the absence of the witness would reduce the accused's chances of success on his alibi defence. His Honour went on, however, to say (at p 5): 

""The mere fact that a witness who would otherwise have been available has died or otherwise becomes unavailable does not warrant the granting of a stay of proceedings."" 

In R v Tolmie (unreported, NSWCCA, 7 December 1994) it was held that the loss of two witnesses did not call for a stay of proceedings. ... 

Recently, in R v Gilham [2007] NSWSC 231 Howie J rejected an application for a stay of proceedings concerning an ex officio indictment presented against the accused charged with the murder of his parents some thirteen years earlier. His Honour remarked in that case (at [79]) that his attention was drawn to no case of a stay having been granted in this State on the basis of lost evidence . [at paras 12-14] [emphasis added] 

21In Gilham v The Queen (2007) 73 NSWLR 308, Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed on this point, said: 

This ground of appeal is expressed in the following way: 

""His Honour erred in finding that appropriate warnings or directions, rulings on admissibility, or other orders would cure any prejudice suffered by the accused, as a result of delay and/or the loss of evidence."" 

The prosecution case against the applicant is entirely circumstantial. ... 

His Honour also set out the evidence that had been lost. That evidence was substantial including the knife used in the killings, the bloodstained coat of the deceased's brother, the clothing allegedly worn by the Applicant at the time of the killings, carpet samples from the living room, samples of textile removed from the deceased brother's coat for forensic testing and swabs that were forwarded for analysis and certain other items. Many of these items were not tested, not least because of the fact that DNA testing was not then as well established as it is now. His Honour outlined this evidence (at [76]-[78]); again it is not necessary to set it out. 

With respect to the lost evidence, his Honour said: 

""[84] As I have already noted, the intended prosecution of the accused is a circumstantial case and the Crown is not relying upon the reliability of any particular witness to prove the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Rather the prosecution would be attempting to prove that the account of the accused given at the time of the killings, or very shortly thereafter, could not possibly be true. To this extent the loss of evidence seems to me to have less impact that it might have. True it is that the defence might have used an exhibit now missing or tests carried out on those exhibits to bolster an inference that the accused's account is true. But the Crown could not rely upon the absence of those exhibits or the lack of testing to support an inference that the accused account was false. This is where I believe that directions or warnings to a jury might be more effective than would be the case where, for example, a complainant in a sexual assault prosecution is an apparently credible and compelling witness. In such a case the jury might more easily be able to dismiss the significance of the lack of evidence in the face of a witness that they feel should be believed. 

[85] The accused complains that the Crown will rely upon evidence of experts who might, because of their expertise, be considered favourably by the jury and yet the accused will not be able to cross-examine them effectively because the exhibits upon which they will express opinions have been lost. The accused is not now in a position to have the exhibits tested by his own experts. But I am not satisfied that this is a matter that cannot be addressed by suitable directions emphasising the lost opportunity of the accused to test the evidence. In any event it appears to me that what the accused has lost is a chance that he might have been able to present evidence that would weigh against the Crown case that his version of the events was false. He has lost an avenue of inquiry, or avenues of inquiry, that may have had a beneficial impact upon his defence: R v Helmling (NSWCCA, unreported, 11 November 1993). That is a matter that appears to me to be appropriately dealt with by directions from the trial judge. 

[86] In R v Slattery [2002] NSWCCA 367 the rifle used in the commission of a shooting offence had been destroyed before defence experts could examine it. The Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the verdict because of a failure of the trial judge to give an adequate warning to the jury, drawing their attention to the possible prejudice to the accused by the inability of the defence to examine the weapon. But there is nothing in the judgment to suggest that, had such a warning been given, the trial would necessarily have been unfair such that the verdict would have been quashed. 

[87] What this decision highlights is the benefit of being able to see with clarity the prejudice to the accused having regard to the evidence actually given at the trial and how, if possible, that might be addressed in light of submissions made to the jury. Otherwise the court in deciding whether there would be such unfairness as to render a trial an abuse of process is left to speculate about the evidence to be led at the trial and to make decisions based upon assertions that might not prove accurate when the issues in the trial are clearly established. This emphasises in my mind the exceptional step of granting a stay on the basis of lost evidence."" 

His Honour's ultimate conclusion in this respect was as follows: 

""[93] To some extent the accused is in a better position than many accused who face trial after long delay or where evidence has become unavailable. His version of events has been preserved and is accessible in a recorded interview. As I have indicated, the Crown will have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the version he gave shortly after the incident is not true. To that extent the accused is less prejudiced by the passage of time even if he has tried to put the events of the night from his memory. 


[94] Further, it should be borne in mind that the result of a refusal to grant a stay does not mean that the accused is without a remedy, if the trial proves to be unfair notwithstanding steps taken by the trial judge to remove that unfairness. It is not unknown for a trial judge to make a decision based upon a forecast of what might occur during a trial or based upon facts and circumstances as they appear to be at the time the decision is made and yet that forecast prove to have been based upon a false assumption or that the facts or circumstances change significantly during the course of the trial. The trial judge can revisit decisions, such as the refusal to order a separate trial, on the basis of what occurs through the trial. The Court of Criminal Appeal can review such a decision made at he start of the trial if it proves that a miscarriage of justice has ultimately eventuated. This is what occurred in one of the authorities relied upon by the accused, R v Garjee an unreported decision of the English Court of Appeal dated 20 September 1994. 

[95] In the present case I suggested that the prosecutor might indicate what submissions the Crown might make to the jury at any trial in light of the missing exhibits so that a more realistic appraisal might be made of the claim of prejudice by the accused. Ultimately that did not transpire. But it seems to me at this stage that the trial judge can deal with the issue of lost evidence by warnings or directions depending upon how the case develops before the jury and what submissions the Crown ultimately makes. Certainly I am not presently persuaded that the trial judge, by appropriate warnings or directions, rulings on admissibility or other orders, cannot cure any prejudice suffered by the accused, particularly having regard to the fact that it is a circumstantial case and that the Crown must prove that the accused's version cannot reasonably be true."" 

In my opinion, his Honour was correct to conclude that, with appropriate directions, the Applicant would receive a fair trial and that it was inappropriate for the Court to intervene at this stage. I specifically agree with Howie J, with respect to the lost evidence, that it is appropriate to adopt the approach of this Court in R v Helmling (NSWCCA unreported 11 November 1993) . 

As noted, Howie J concluded that the matters relied upon are capable of being revisited during the course of the trial in order to identify what if any prejudice emerges. I agree . Should there be a trial resulting in conviction, no doubt the actual course of the events together with the actual directions given by the trial judge can be the basis of grounds of appeal with full knowledge of the relevant facts. His Honour was correct, for the reasons he gave, to conclude, in effect, that the application was premature . 

... 

There is a substantial public interest in permitting alleged crimes of such seriousness to be determined on their merits. The expectation, said to be legitimate, induced in the mind of the Applicant by the Crown's delay and prevarication, is not entitled to significant weight in the case of alleged murder . In my opinion, Howie J correctly found that the events said to result in oppression do not prevail over that public interest, for the reasons he gave. (C/f Filipowski supra at [32].) [paras 116 - 117, 119 -123, 130] [emphasis added] 

22In Penney v R (1998) 155 ALR 605, it was contended that an unfair and incompetent police investigation had rendered the verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory. Callinan J, with whom the remainder of the Court agreed, said: 

It was put that there was, in effect, a trial process which began at the inception of the investigation leading to the bringing of a charge and that a defective police investigation had so infected that trial process that the trial was not a fair trial. 

There is no doubt that the police investigation was unsatisfactory in some respects. However these defects were fully exposed to the jury in cross-examination and the address to the jury by the appellant's counsel. There was some reinforcement of the criticism of these defects by the accurate summary of the defence submissions to the jury by the trial judge . 

The appellant's submissions on these contentions fail at the threshold. They fail because even though a better investigation may, and probably should have, been conducted, there is no general proposition of Australian law that a complete and unexceptionable investigation of an alleged crime is a necessary element of the trial process, or indeed of a fair trial . That is not to give any imprimatur to incomplete, unfair or insufficient police investigations. Indeed there may be cases in which deficiencies in the investigation might be of such significance to a particular case as a whole that the accused will be entitled to an acquittal or a retrial. But that will all depend on the facts of the particular case. [paras 16-18] [emphasis added] 

23In R v Edwards (2009) 83 ALJR 717 the High Court observed: 

The respondents do not contend that the loss of objective evidence, such as electronically recorded data or the like, would ordinarily justify a stay of proceedings on indictment. In the course of argument the respondents conceded that the loss of film recorded by a closed-circuit television camera at the scene of an alleged offence would not afford a basis for a stay. They seek to distinguish their case on the basis that the loss here is of the independent record of the event giving rise to the charge. This is said to be productive of unfairness of the kind that informs the power to stay since the trial will necessarily involve an incomplete reconstruction of the event. 

The distinction between an independent record forming a constituent part of an event and an independent record of an event is without substance. Trials involve the reconstruction of events and it happens on occasions that relevant material is not available; documents, recordings and other things may be lost or destroyed. Witnesses may die. The fact that the tribunal of fact is called upon to determine issues of fact upon less than all of the material which could relevantly bear upon the matter does not make the trial unfair . [at paras 30-31] [footnotes omitted] 

24In Aydin v R [2010] VSCA 190 the Victorian Court of Appeal considered a case in which the relevant incident, which involved a woman being dragged from her car at knifepoint, had occurred in 1982. It was not until 2007 that a suspect was identified when a fingerprint match was made. By then, in accordance with the normal police practice of destroying files after 20 years, most of the file had been destroyed. Harper JA, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 

What is important in a case such as the present, therefore, is not the document management policy as such, but the effect that the unavailability of the police file has on the fairness of the trial. And here, as was said by the High Court in R v Edwards , quoting from the judgment of the same Court in Walton v Gardiner, the test is: 

... 'whether, in all the circumstances, the continuation of the proceedings would involve unacceptable injustice or unfairness', or whether the 'continuation of the proceedings would be ""so unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive"" as to constitute an abuse of process'. 


In Edwards the Court thus stressed that it is not sufficient that the loss of relevant material could or might result in injustice or unacceptable lack of fairness; it must be shown that that would be the result. And the Court further stated that a permanent stay must not be granted unless the court before which the application is made is 'satisfied that the continuation of the proceedings constituted an abuse in an exceptional or extreme case. 

The applicant sought to meet this test by submitting that he has lost the opportunity, which may otherwise have been open to him, to obtain alibi evidence, or other evidence which might sustain an hypothesis sufficient - at the least - to prevent the prosecution proving its case to the requisite standard. Time will have worked its power to subtract, to add and to distort - in short, to diminish the ability of a jury to reach a true verdict. Likewise (the applicant's submission continued) he has been deprived of the opportunity to expose gaps or other difficulties in the prosecution case which might be discerned on a proper analysis of the materials in the now unavailable police file, or which might have become apparent on questioning the original police investigators. Both of these officers have since retired, and have no notes and no independent memory of their investigation. In addition, the police have lost another photograph of another fingerprint found on the inside of the same car window on 26 September 1982. At the committal hearing, Sergeant Brian Ritchie, the fingerprint expert who took the original photographs, told the Court that this second photograph 'was possibly someone else'; but, if it was, that other person has never been identified. 

At the committal, Mr Ritchie also referred to another 'probable' suspect - a man named Jose Manuel Alonso. On a voir dire before her Honour, however, the informant (Detective Senior Constable Costakis Costa) said that he had made further inquiries about this person, without result; and Mr Costa added that he did not know whether Mr Alonso 'was ever considered a person of interest."" 

Both before her Honour, and on this application, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that in her original statement, now lost, the complainant probably gave more details about her assailant than appear in the statement made after the applicant became a suspect. If those additional details were now available, the applicant might be able to point to discrepancies between them and his own appearance. It is already apparent that photographs said to have been taken of the applicant at about the time of the offence show a man without a paunch; whereas the complainant now says that her attacker had a pot belly. 

It was submitted on this application, but not in the court below, that a like argument could be made about the vehicle in which the complainant's assailant was travelling. She may have given a description of it in her first statement; and even if that description were not sufficient to enable the police to identify that vehicle as being associated with the applicant, it may have been detailed enough to enable the applicant to deny any connection with it. 

It is appropriate, it seems to me, to test the applicant's submissions by asking what the realities are likely to be should the trial proceed. As was said by the authors of Abuse of Process in Criminal Proceedings 

Unsurprisingly, ... courts ... have been concerned to ensure that unscrupulous and opportunistic defendants are prevented from either successfully making false claims concerning the purported prejudice suffered because of the loss by the prosecution or constructing false defences ex post facto based on knowledge of the unfortunate loss. This attitude of scepticism towards defence complaints of prejudice in these circumstances is consistent with that concerning defence complaints arising out of prosecutorial delay. In ... R v Cardiff Magistrates' Court, ex p Hole ... Bingham CJ insisted that the defence, in arguing abuse, would have to establish precisely how in relation to the defence(s) to be advanced at trial prejudice was suffered, '... it is necessary to look at the charges and see exactly what defence it is that they are impeded from advancing'. 


... 
It may be that during the course of the trial material does come to light which alters the perspective which at present seems to me to be compelling. In the meantime I must, I think, conclude that this case does not fall into that exceptional class in respect of which an application for a permanent stay will succeed. But, as was said by Ashley JA in Wells v R : 


... it might appear, as the trial proceeds, that the circumstances are otherwise than I presently apprehend them. If that turned out to be the case, the applicant would not be precluded from making a further application for a stay . [paras 17-22, 28] [emphasis added] 

25In PG v R [2010] VSCA 289, the applicant was charged with various sexual assaults upon his daughters. The applicant's initial record of interview with police was missing. Furthermore, police did not interview him in relation to later allegations which had been made against him. The Court of Appeal rejected an application for leave to appeal against the trial judge's decision to refuse to order a permanent stay. Neave JA, with whom the other members of the court agreed, placed reliance upon what the High Court said in Edwards about the significance of missing evidence. Her Honour said: 

""Moreover case law indicates that even where missing evidence is directly related to the alleged offences, it will rarely provide the basis for the conclusion that the prosecution amounts to an abuse of process"". ... 

""Any disadvantage which may be suffered by the applicant must be weighed against the interests of the community in ensuring the prosecution of persons alleged to have committed serious criminal offences."" [at paras 20, 23] 

26It will be necessary to refer in a little detail to one further case upon which counsel for the applicant relied. In written submission, counsel contended that ""[t]he police have a duty to comprehensively investigate information and search out contemporaneous witnesses who might be able to shed light on the relevant circumstances: Regina v Littler [2001] NSWCCA 173 at [24] and [25]"". Although that was a case in which the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that the trial judge had erred in refusing to grant a permanent stay, it is clearly a decision which very much turns on its own facts. The applicant was 74 years of age and in ill-health. There was evidence as to his psychological, psychiatric and other health issues. Moreover, there was expert evidence concerning his loss of memory. The allegations were of sexual assaults alleged to have occurred between 38 and 46 years before the trial. In order to provide some context for the proposition upon which the applicant relies, it is useful to set out precisely what Adams J, who wrote the leading judgment, said in the paragraphs which are relied upon. His Honour said: 

It was submitted that the great delay between the dates upon which it is alleged the offences (whatever they were) allegedly occurred and the applicant's trial has resulted in such prejudice that a fair trial cannot be conducted. This prejudice falls into three main classes. The first concerns the unavailability of numerous potential witnesses who are dead, demented or unable to be identified. Related to this issue, of course, is the undoubted fact that such of these witnesses who might have been able to give relevant evidence at one time might very well now not be able to do so for failure of recollection caused simply by the lapse of time and ordinary human fragility. A lengthy list of Marist Brothers who were on the staff of the Home at the relevant time together with the names of various other persons who worked there in various capacities, was supplied to Maguire DCJ. His Honour accepted that most of these potential witnesses were dead, mentally incapacitated or unable to be located. Of course, any properly conducted police investigation should have thrown up the names of possibly material witnesses and attempts should have been made to locate them in light of the possibility that relevant evidence material to the issues in the case might have been discovered. The mere fact, if it occurred, that this evidence might assist the defence of course, should have been irrelevant. The statements of both complainants in this case are noteworthy for the omission of any mention of staff members or friends with whom, it seems reasonable to suppose, they had communications of greater or lesser intimacy. So far as the Crown case is concerned, it is for all practical purposes entirely focused upon the evidence of the complainants, lacking any supporting evidence, let alone corroboration. 

In cases of this kind, where allegations are made and charges brought after such a lengthy delay, the investigating police have the duty, in my view, to search out contemporaneous witnesses who might be able to shed light on the relevant circumstances. It is not appropriate to leave this investigation to the defence or, of course, to the complainants. Although in a sense, therefore, it is for the applicant to establish such prejudice as would justify a stay of proceedings, this should be in the context of a full and adequate investigation by the prosecuting authorities which provides a context that enables the court to evaluate in a sensible way the extent of the prejudice affecting the accused. In light of the material tendered in the District Court in this case, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion either that little more has been done than the reduction of the complainants' allegations to a statement in the conventional form or that there are no witnesses now available and able to provide relevant and significant evidence. [at paras 24-25] 

27For completeness, I should record that counsel for the applicant made cursory reference to two further decisions, namely R v Davis (1995) 57 FCR 512 and DA v The Queen [2000] ACTSC 58, in which a permanent stay had been granted. Each case involved allegations of sexual assault in which records had been destroyed or lost and again I am satisfied that they each turned on their own facts. Indeed, counsel did not suggest otherwise. 

The basis of the application 

28Counsel for the applicant candidly acknowledged that no one factor standing alone could warrant the granting of a permanent stay. What was contended however was that a number of features of the case, when considered in combination, gave rise to what was described as ""irreparable unfairness"". It will be necessary to refer to each of the submissions which were advanced in support of the overall contention in turn. 

29Before doing so, it will be necessary to say a little more about the factual background to the offence. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the description of events provided by the eye-witnesses, John Byrne and Ian Cross, indicated that a group of men described as ""Islander males"" had approached the altercation between the deceased and the Caucasian male with the goatee beard which took place on The Crescent. According to Ian Cross, one of those men, who had braided hair which was in a ponytail, assaulted the deceased on two occasions, the second occasion being on the corner of The Crescent and Smart Street. It appears that the deceased then ran into Smart Street. Although his body was found the following morning in the carpark area at the end of the laneway of Smart Street, there is no eyewitness account of what occurred in Smart Street, or in the laneway or in the carpark. Counsel for the applicant submitted that in those circumstances it was a reasonable possibility ""that one of the Islanders was responsible for whatever altercation led to the injuries that resulted in the death of the deceased"". In that context, emphasis was also placed upon the fact that Yakup Tomruk, Michael Tomruk, Keith Walsh, Paul Beavan and David Hakalo were all identified as suspects from an early point in the investigation. Counsel also pointed out that the applicant had been ""excluded as a contributor to the DNA samples found on the shoelaces of the Adidas shoes, on the inner sole and the inside toe area of the right shoe"". The consequence, so it was submitted, is that an unidentified person or persons must have been the contributor to those samples. 

(a) The failure of police to promptly investigate information received in 1999 that Claude Rinston had admitted killing the deceased 

30A police running sheet, which was created on 21 July 1999 in relation to the investigation of the killing of the deceased, contains the following information: 

On the 20 th of July, 1999 a community source spoke to Detective Inspector Rees the Fairfield Crime Manager indicating that he had spoken to Ashur Darmo who told him that a person by the name of Claude Rinston had admitted being responsible for the death of the deceased. Rinston had also indicated that he is considering handing himself in to police. 

31Counsel for the applicant pointed out that no attempt had been made to locate or even identify Claude Rinston until 2009. Moreover, Ashur Darmo was not spoken to until April this year even though police were aware of his address from at least 2001. When police eventually obtained a statement from him, he effectively claimed to know nothing about the matter. In his statement the following information appears: 

I can say that no one has ever spoken to me about committing a murder or a bad crime, or any other illegal activity to me. The first time that I was aware that my name had been mentioned in relation to the murder of Russell Lyons was when police came to my door on 13 May 2009. 

I don't know a person by the name of Claude Rinston or any person with a similar name. The surname Rinston is unusual, it doesn't ring a bell. I have no recollection of being involved in any conversation involving the name Claude Rinston. 
... 

I can say for certain that I have never spoken to or told anybody that anyone has ever said anything to me about the murder of Russell Lyons. 

32Counsel for the applicant submitted that the failure to investigate the information in 1999 has ""deprived [the applicant] of the opportunity of assessing ... whether [the] information was credible"". One avenue which it was suggested may have been explored was whether there was a connection between Ashur Darmo and Claude Rinston. 

(b) The failure by police to promptly investigate information received in 2005 that Michael Tomruk had admitted killing the deceased 

33It was in respect of this issue that oral evidence was adduced from Senior Constable Connelly, as well as from Brett Kennedy and Paul Johnson. Senior Constable Connelly gave evidence that on 11 February 2005 he had created a running sheet after receiving a complaint from Paul Johnson that he had been assaulted and threatened by two men, Michael Tomruk and Joseph Kasuvomic. The evidence reveals that a dispute had arisen between them in relation to the supply of illicit drugs. The running sheet records that Paul Johnson alleged that Michael Tomruk had threatened to kill him. The following information then appears: 

Michael Tomrook [sic] has then said to the victim, ""I've killed someone before. Your [sic] nothing to me. You'll feel the knife go into your throat and feel it go out."" 

34A little later the following information is recorded: 

Police also interviewed a further witness [who it can be inferred is Brett Kennedy] who has audio taping of the accused's voice, a Joseph Kasumovic where the accused is heard to say that the victim will be in a body bag as well as to say that the victim received a smacking and that he had a black eye. These conversation [sic] were then recorded as possible evidence by Police. ... 

On the 1 st of June, 2005 the victim was spoken too [sic] to update him as to the status of the said investigation. At this time, the victim stated that he no longer wishes to proceed with the complaint and desired no formal charges to be laid. The victim declined to make a retraction statement, stating that his word was good enough. 

35A little later that same day, Senior Constable Connelly created a further running sheet after having been contacted by Brett Kennedy who also complained about having received a number of threatening phone calls from Joseph Kasuvomic. That running sheet records that ""these telephone calls and verbal messages were all recorded on the victim's answering service. ... Police have obtained recordings of all [those] telephone calls and voice messages."" Senior Constable Connelly said that he ""had heard the messages from the phone."" He also gave evidence that he believed that he had kept a copy of the recordings and that he had advised Mr Kennedy to do so as well. (Mr Kennedy in his evidence confirmed that he had done so but said that he had discarded the mobile phone upon which the messages were recorded some considerable time ago). 

36On 1 March 2005 Senior Constable Connelly created an Information Report Summary. It contains the following information: 

On the 1 st of March, 2005 Fairfield Police were contacted by a community source [Brett Kennedy]. This community source is currently having numerous communication offences committed upon him which was currently under investigation. These telecommunications also stem from a recent assault upon a Mr Paul JOHNSON of Fairfield. 

On or about the 1 st of March, 2005 it is then alleged that the POI [Michael Tomruk] has contacted the community source by telephone were [sic] he has challenged the community source over his friendship with Paul JOHNSON. The POI during this conversation has threatened the community source and attempted to instil fear into him by saying something to the effect of ""I've killed a man before and got away with it."" The POI allegedly mentioned the mans [sic] name as being that of a Russell LYONS who lived in Fairfield. This detail was not prior knowledge to the community source. 

37It appears that that conversation was not recorded. 

38Paul Johnson provided a statement, dated 5 May 2011, in which he said that he did not know who had killed the deceased although ""the general talk at The Crescent Hotel was that three Islanders were responsible. I don't know who these people are."" In his evidence he said that he used to drink with Michael Tomruk at The Crescent Hotel in 1995. 

39Brett Kennedy provided a statement dated 18 April 2011. It included the following information: 

I have a vague memory of ringing the police, it may have been Crime Stoppers, I'm not too sure, about hearing some information about Mick Tomruk and some of the Islander boys who he drank with at the pub, the Crescent, I think it is, the one on the corner near Fairfield Police Station. I heard that one of them was involved and they stole a pair of shoes from Russell; a pair of shoes that were thrown on the awning or something like that. I heard this information when I was down at the park in Fairfield in a drinking binge. The park was along railway parade there, near the carpark for the commuters. 

I was sitting in the park with Paul Johnson when it was said. I don't know who said, they weren't talking to me they were talking to Paul from memory. I don't remember who was saying it and I can't describe them, it is all very vague. It would have been late in the afternoon and I would have been intoxicated by that time. I was drinking 6 to 12 long necks of VB beer back then, they were blurry days. At the time I made the call to the police about this information there is a 90 per cent chance I was drinking as that was my life then. I think this was in about 2006 or 2007. ... 

I would drink with Paul everyday down at the park. People used to come down selling pills and their methadone. I was using marijuana and alcohol heavily. Paul and I used to take the micky out of the people selling pills and the methadone. ... 

Detective Willey asked me if I remember receiving any threatening phone calls back then. I remember getting calls from a bloke called Joe, he was selling heroin and marijuana and he had a heroin habit. I remember him calling me and him threatening me saying I would be next and Paul Johnson would be next and they would do the same to me as they did to Russell. I think I reported this to police. I can't remember which police I reported this too [sic]. I think I would have told police about the same time... I told them about Russell. 

40In his evidence, Brett Kennedy said that he had gone to school with the deceased's older brother. He said that he had been living in Western Australia in 1995 when he was informed that the deceased had been killed. In his evidence, Brett Kennedy maintained that although Michael Tomruk had been pointed out to him, he had never actually spoken to him. He said that he had no memory of telling a police officer that Michael Tomruk had called him and said that he (Michael Tomruk) had killed the deceased. He said that that information had been conveyed to him by Joseph Kasumovic. 

41The applicant observes that not only were no steps taken in 2005 to investigate the information which was provided by Brett Kennedy, but that Michael Tomruk was not interviewed until 19 May 2009. In his statement Michael Tomruk claimed that he had been in Queensland at around the time of the incident. The applicant submits, correctly, that there is no direct evidence available to establish that he was in fact in Queensland at the time when the deceased was killed. Indeed, Michael Tomruk concedes in his statement that he is unable to recall exactly where he was. When Paul Johnson was asked if he remembered anything about Michael Tomruk playing rugby league in Queensland in 1995, he replied: 

""No, I don't. If he went up to Queensland he wasn't there for long."" 

42The applicant also points to the fact that Detective Willey did not question Michael Tomruk about the admission which he is alleged to have made to Mr Kennedy. 

43Complaint is also made about the fact that no statement was taken from Mr Kennedy until 18 April this year. It is further contended that although Mr Kennedy makes reference in his statement to having given the police information about the deceased, his account is vague. It was submitted that the passage of time had dimmed his memory. That problem, so it was contended, would not have arisen had a contemporaneous statement been taken from him. 

44As I have said, Senior Constable Connelly gave evidence that police obtained recordings of the telephone calls and voice messages which had been left on Brett Kennedy's phone by Mr Kasumovic. However, the evidence reveals that this material is no longer available. As a consequence, it is submitted that ""the applicant has been deprived of the opportunity to effectively cross-examine this witness and to put material before the jury supporting the credibility of Brett Kennedy. The prejudice afforded by the failure to properly investigate this information is compounded by the fact that the Crown is going to suggest that Kennedy is an unreliable witness."" It is submitted that the telephone calls and messages could have bolstered the credibility of Brett Kennedy. The fact that they are no longer available means, so it was submitted, that the applicant is deprived of the advantage which that material would have provided to him. It is also submitted that ""the evidence that Michael Tomruk admitted killing Lyons is particularly significant in the context of an investigation that had targeted the Tomruks and their associates from 1995"". 

45By way of conclusion it was submitted that ""the police have failed to properly investigate two lines of inquiry relating to admissions by suspects to killing [the deceased]. The Applicant has been deprived not only of information to effectively cross-examine witnesses considered suspects in the initial police investigation but, importantly, has been deprived of the opportunity to place before the jury credible evidence that admissions to the killing were made by others."" 

(c) The loss of a number of interviews conducted with suspects and other witnesses as well as the loss of photographic arrays shown to witnesses in the initial stages of the investigation 

46It is common ground that a number of interviews, as well as various photographic arrays which were shown to eye-witnesses, have been lost.

(d) The failure of police to promptly show eye-witnesses photographs of four potential suspects with goatee beards 

48In a document created by Detective Senior Constable Leighton, dated 7 June 2000, it is stated that ""the following 14 persons have been identified as suspects for the purpose of DNA testing in relation to the murder of Russell Lyons"". I should indicate that it is not entirely clear upon what basis each of those persons were then thought to be suspects. In a review apparently completed in April 2005 the following entry appears: ""Numerous POIs identified but unclear as to level of any suspicion attached to those persons, numerous suspects were interviewed by police"". In any event, of the 14 persons on the list, the first 7 persons named are Yakup Tomruk, Keith Walsh, David Hakalo, Paul Beaven, Jack Rai, Michael Rai and Suipeli Fuahala. The following material then appears: 

Information was received that a male with a goatee beard being held in custody at the Wetherill Park police cells on the 3 rd of June, 1995, had been bragging that he bashed a male in the Fairfield area. The following persons no.8 to No.11 matched the description and were in custody at Wetherill Park on the 03/06/1995. 

49The persons numbered 8 to 11 are identified as M.A. Warnes, C. Warnes, B. Hillier and M. Hatch. The remaining three suspects are referred to as Peter Fayka, Lefeiloaisamoa Saipaia and Big Sam (who has never been identified). 

50The primary material upon which Detective Senior Constable Leighton appears to have relied in creating the document to which I have just referred is a running sheet, created on 4 June 1995, in which the following information appears: 

About 5 pm 04/06/1995 Detective McNeil received information which is as follows: 
A male named Willy from Yennora, was locked up at Wetherill Park Police Station. Whilst Willy was in the Lockup there was an Australian with short cropped hair and a goatee beard. The Australian stated to Willy that he and a couple of his mates had bashed a bloke at Fairfield real good and left him there. It is also stated that the Australian guy was drunk and kept on talking about the bashing. 

51In a further running sheet created on 14 July 1999 the following information appears: 

Information from Detective McNeil is that he attended the Wetherill Park Police Station and spoke to Willy. He states that he interviewed Willy and he denied any involvement in the assault/murder. This inquiry was then eliminated. 

52In the circumstances it was submitted that the four persons identified by Detective Leighton as having ""matched the description"" should all have been placed in a photographic array which could then have been viewed by the eye-witnesses in order to see if they could make an identification. It was further submitted that ""the applicant is prejudiced by the failure by the police to properly investigate the possibility that one of the prisoners matching the description could have been the caucasian man described by Byrne and Cross"". 

53Before proceeding any further I should refer to the evidence which was adduced on this application concerning DNA testing. According to a report prepared by Ms Burger, dated 21 August 2003, a number of DNA profiles were extracted from a number of samples taken from the Adidas shoes. 

54The samples were taken from: 

(i) the inside toe area of the right Adidas shoe, 
(ii) the inside tongue area of the left Adidas shoe, and 
(iii) DNA mixtures from the inner sole and the shoelaces of the Adidas shoes. 

55Buccal reference samples were taken from Paul Beaven, Keith Walsh and David Hakalo. These suspects were excluded as being contributors to samples (i), (ii) and (iii). 

56The DNA profiles of Jack Rai, Michael Rai, Mark Warnes, Chris Warnes, Billy Hillier, and Peter Fayka were entered into the DNA database. Their DNA profiles have been tested against all crime samples on the NSW DNA database. However, as counsel for the applicant points out, only the first two of the three samples which I just referred to were entered into the database. In other words, there is no evidence that the mixtures of DNA profiles taken from the shoelaces and inner soles of the shoes were entered into the database. It follows that of the original suspects, Yakup Tomruk, Mark Hatch and Lefeiloaisamoa Saipaia have not been subjected to DNA testing. Nor, for that matter has Michael Tomruk although, as I understand it, his profile was not available for comparison with the crime scene samples. 

(e) The destruction of a pair of Nike running shoes 

57A Police Running Sheet dated 5 June 1995 records the following information: 

At 11.55am 05/05/1995 the above person [whose name has been removed] spoke to P.C. Cst P MAVIN at the north eastern ramp of the Fairfield Railway Station. He informed that he had just walked from his mothers [sic] address to the railway station and had seen a pair of running shoes in the park opposite Patricia [sic] Bros High School. 

Scene attended and Nike Air running shoes, black white and purple in colour located together on grass approx 5 metres from the western kerb of Fairfield St on off ramp from the Horsley Drive. Opposite small set of shops. 

Possible blood stains on front of left shoe. 

58It is common ground that the distance between the crime scene and the location of the Nike shoes is approximately 550 metres. The evidence reveals that the Nike shoes have been destroyed. 

59Counsel for the applicant submitted that ""...the primary evidence relied upon by the Crown is a pair of Adidas shoes alleged to have been worn by the assailant and which the Crown allege belonged to the accused. The Crown relies heavily upon the fact that the Adidas shoes had the deceased's blood on them and were abandoned near the scene. ... However, the Adidas shoes were not the only running shoes abandoned in the vicinity. The Nike shoes were found proximate to the area where the deceased was found. They were observed to have 'possible blood stains'. The shoes were found on the same day as the Adidas shoes. The destruction of those shoes creates a fundamental and irreperable [sic] unfairness to the Applicant that cannot be cured by direction. It would be highly unfair to allow the Crown the advantage of relying on the Adidas shoes and the forensic evidence obtained there from when the applicant has been deprived of the opportunity to place before the jury evidence of another pair of running shoes found nearby that may have produced forensic evidence raising a reasonable alternative hypothesis. ... The Nike shoes, located as they were with 'possible blood staining', could have provided evidence establishing a link to one of the suspects nominated. The applicant is forever deprived of the opportunity to establish that link."" 

60In oral submissions it was contended that forensic testing may even have revealed that the shoes belonged to the deceased. It was also submitted that ""the loss of the opportunity to have them tested deprived the applicant of the opportunity to put material before the jury of a reasonable alternative hypothesis"" that someone else was the real offender. In highlighting what was said to be the inherent unfairness of the situation, counsel for the applicant emphasised what she described as the ""seductive"" nature of DNA evidence. 

61Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that whilst the circumstances in which a permanent stay may be granted will be rare, it was nonetheless critical that this application should be determined solely upon an assessment of the facts of the present case. Indeed, it was upon that very basis that counsel sought to distinguish some of the decisions to which I have referred. For example, in relation to Hatfield (supra), it was submitted that the court in that case had determined that even though evidence had been lost, its loss did not affect other evidence in the case, such as admissions which had been made by the accused and listening device material. The consequence, so it was submitted, was that Hatfield was a case of a very different kind from the present one. 

62It was also pointed out that in Gilham (supra), the applicant had given an account only shortly after the fatal incident. That factor, it was noted, had prompted the trial judge in that case to comment that ""[t]o some extent the accused is in a better position than many accused who face trial after long delay or where evidence has become unavailable. His version of events has been preserved and is accessible in a recorded interview"". Indeed, it was submitted that the present applicant faced the very disadvantage which was identified in Gilham , namely of being accused of a crime many years after the event. Accordingly, it was submitted that the circumstances in Gilham are also distinguishable from the present case. 

63So much may be accepted. Nonetheless, the range of circumstances which emerge from the various authorities to which reference has been made, together with the statements of principle contained in them, provide some assistance in resolving the present application. That said, I unhesitantly accept that the present application falls to be determined upon an assessment of totality of the evidence that has been adduced in respect of it. 

Consideration 

64It seems palpably clear that the deceased was the victim of an unlawful homicide. In addition to the very obvious interest which the deceased's family and friends have in the matter, the community itself has a very significant interest in having serious crimes, such as the present one, promptly investigated in order that any person alleged to have been responsible for it can be brought before the courts. The consequence is that any information which may lead to the apprehension of a suspect should be investigated by police as soon as is reasonably practicable. It is reasonable to assume that information that a nominated person has admitted responsibility for having killed someone would normally engage the immediate attention of investigators. In this case two such persons were nominated. By the time each of those persons were nominated, it would appear that all other leads had been exhausted. In those circumstances, one might reasonably have thought that any new information would have been pursued as a matter of priority. The apparent failure to do so is, in my view, quite bewildering. It should also be observed that various other lines of enquiry were only recently investigated and then, as I understand the situation, only as a result of requests made by the applicant's legal representatives. 

65It is convenient to now deal with each of the separate matters that were raised on behalf of the applicant. 

(a) The failure of police to promptly investigate information received in 1999 that Claude Rinston had admitted killing the deceased 

66The initial police investigation can be legitimately criticised upon the basis that no inquiry was made concerning the identity of a Claude Rinston until 2009, that is, approximately 10 years after police first received the information about him. Detective Willey gave the following evidence in relation to efforts which he has made to locate that person: 

Q. In the case of Claude Rinston, in your statement that's before his Honour, you say that you made a number of enquiries to ascertain further information as to the location of that person. Then you say including, and you nominate things that you did. Could you tell the Court the full extent of the enquiries you made to ascertain the identity or further information concerning Claude Rinston? 
A. I've conducted searches of the New South Wales Police COPS data base system which has a national search function. Searching for the name Claude Rinston there were no results for that name or for the surname Rinston alone. I've also conducted enquiries with the New South Wales RTA data base, for the name Claude Rinston. Again, no match to the name Claude Rinston on that data base. I did an inquiry with the Births, Deaths and Marriages for a period of January 1970 to December 1979, for Claude Rinston. That was unable to match any person with a birth certificate. I've conducted searches on the White Pages in each state and territory and unable to match the name Claude Rinston. I've also done a Google search and Facebook search for Claude Rinston and have not been able to match the name Claude Rinston to any person. 


67Moreover, Ashur Darmo, the source of the information that Claude Rinston had admitted killing the deceased, was not interviewed until approximately 12 years after he is said to have initially provided that information. The delay in pursuing those matters has not been explained. Even allowing for the fact that the information which was provided may have been regarded as somewhat unreliable because of the circuitous fashion in which it came to light it still, in my view, ought to have been investigated rather more promptly. 

68No doubt counsel for the applicant will be able to explore each of the criticisms which I have identified before the jury. It can be anticipated that police efforts to locate Claude Rinston will also be closely scrutinised. Furthermore, details of the initial information will undoubtedly be elicited in cross-examination in such a fashion as to provide a basis for a submission that the Crown is unable to exclude to the requisite standard that it was Claude Rinston who killed the deceased. Moreover, Ashur Darmo is to be called by the Crown as a witness and can be cross-examined. In my view, it is a matter for speculation as to what he may have said had he been interviewed in 1999 or shortly thereafter. For all one can tell, he may have adopted the stance which he now appears to be taking. 

69In all those circumstances I am not persuaded, in respect of this issue, that the applicant has been able to demonstrate the existence of the kind of prejudice for which he contends. 

(b) The failure of police to promptly investigate information received in 2005 that Michael Tomruk had admitted killing the deceased 

70It was not suggested by the Crown that the source of the information, or the information itself, was such as would require him or it to be immediately disregarded as being inherently unreliable or improbable. In those circumstances, it is most curious that the 'source', Brett Kennedy, was not interviewed until recently, that is some six years after he had first reported the conversation to police. Equally curious is the fact that the man who is alleged to have made the admission, Michael Tomruk, was not interviewed for a period of about four years after the alleged admission was made, particularly since he was said to be one of the original suspects in the matter. By then fourteen years had elapsed since the deceased had been killed. Moreover, nothing was advanced to explain the delay in interviewing either man. It is also somewhat surprising that the allegation that he had admitted to the killing was not put to Michael Tomruk when he was interviewed. Again no explanation was proffered as to why that had not been done. 

71As I have already observed, Michael Tomruk told police that he had spent the 1995 season playing rugby league in Mackay, Queensland and that he had gone there with his friend, Sam Tapa in order to do so. He said that he had only returned to Sydney once during that period and that was to attend the funeral of Sam Tapa's father. In an effort to verify his story, police in July 2009 obtained documentation, which consists of newspaper clippings and other official programs for the competition, from the Mackay and District Rugby League Group. Notwithstanding its limitations, that material lends some support for Michael Tomruk's contention that he was playing in that competition during that season. 

72That same material also indicates that Sam Tapa was listed in the program to play in the Mackay competition on the weekend of 3/4 June 1995. It is submitted by the Crown that Mr Tapa is unlikely to have missed his father's funeral and so that it is improbable that it was that weekend that Michael Tomruk was in Sydney. Mr Tapa told police in May 2009 that he had been playing rugby league in Mackay in 1995. He said that the only time that he had returned to Sydney was to attend his father's funeral which he thought was in September of that year. When spoken to recently, Mr Tapa told police that he had nothing new to add to what he had previously told them but declined to make a formal statement. Although the Crown made both Michael Tomruk and Sama Tapa available for cross-examination on this application, counsel for the applicant declined the invitation to do so, although she had initially indicated that they would be required. 

73The Crown intends to call Michael Tomruk at the trial. He will undoubtedly deny that he killed the deceased. Nevertheless, the applicant will be able to test him in cross-examination about his purported alibi as well as upon his alleged admission. It is true that there is no direct evidence, either way, as to his whereabouts at the time of the fatal incident. It is of course entirely possible that an investigation which had addressed that issue at an earlier point in time may have assisted the applicant. By the same token, an earlier investigation may have enabled Michael Tomruk, when events were fresher in his mind, to have provided a more detailed account in support of an alibi. In assessing his alibi, it must be recognised that the first awareness that police had of Michael Tomruk's alleged admission was some 10 years after the fatal incident. In those circumstances this issue will remain a matter for speculation. 

74So far as Mr Kennedy's credibility is concerned, it may be accepted that his memory has dimmed in the period since he provided the information to police. However, his evidence suggests that his memory may have been dulled, even in 2005, by the alcohol and drugs which he was then ingesting. Nevertheless, so far as his credibility is concerned, it is significant that evidence as to what he told police in 2005 has been retained and can, and no doubt will, be elicited before the jury. 

75In any event, it appears to me that the applicant has a considerable body of material upon which to exploit the failure of the police to promptly investigate the admission allegedly made by Michael Tomruk. Although it is difficult to be dogmatic about the issue at this stage, particularly given that the invitation which was extended to the applicant to cross-examine Michael Tomruk and Sam Tapa was not accepted, it appears highly likely that the applicant will still be able to submit to the jury that the Crown is unable to exclude the reasonable hypothesis that it was Michael Tomruk who killed the deceased. To that end, attention will undoubtedly focus upon the fact that he has not been subjected to any DNA analysis. 

76In all those circumstances I am not persuaded, in respect of this issue, that the applicant has been able to demonstrate the existence of the kind of prejudice for which he contends. 

(c) the loss of a number of interviews conducted with suspects and other witnesses as well as the loss of photographic arrays shown to witnesses in the initial stages of the investigation 

77Although it is common ground that various photographic arrays have gone missing, photographs of four of the original principal suspects, Yakup Tomruk, Paul Beavan, David Hakalo and Keith Walsh, were placed into a video identification array. That video was viewed by John Byrne and Ian Cross on 24 July 1998, by Alan Jones on 12 January 1999, and by Raquel and Victor Caballero on 17 February 1999. The first three were eye-witnesses to the events surrounding the fatal incident, whilst the Caballeros were involved in another incident that evening which may have involved the persons who were suspected of killing the deceased. It is common ground that none of those witnesses identified any of those four persons. 

78There are also, as I have said, a number of missing interviews. Although they have been described as interviews it is not clear what form these took. What is known however is that each of the missing interviews relating to the five persons who viewed the video identification array, occurred on the day of the viewings. As I have indicated, none of the witnesses were able to make a positive identification. It appears to be common ground that the irresistible inference is that each of those interviews concerned the identification process. In any event, the running sheets which contain that information are available. Furthermore, the original statements made by each of those five persons have been retained. Importantly, so far as John Byrne and Ian Cross are concerned, a number of other statements which they made are also still available, together with the evidence which they each gave both at the inquest and at the committal hearing. 

79That leaves for consideration the missing interviews which were conducted with Keith Walsh, Paul Beavan and David Hakalo. The interview with Mr Walsh was conducted on 7 April whilst the interviews with the other two were conducted on15 April 1998. However, summaries of each of those interviews are contained in running sheets maintained by the investigation team. Included in that summary, is a denial in each case by the person in question, of any involvement in the deceased's murder. There is a further interview which was conducted with Mr Walsh approximately two weeks after the murder itself, that has also gone missing. However, it is clear from the summary of the interview conducted with him on 7 April 1998, and from a subsequent ERISP interview conducted with him on 18 August 1999 (which is in evidence), that he has consistently denied from the outset any involvement in the deceased's murder. Finally, each of those three persons was interviewed on occasions other than those in which respect of which the interviews have gone missing. Each of those interviews are available. I should also record that both of the interviews which were conducted with Yakup Tomruk on 6 June 1995 and 13 October 1999 respectively, in which he denied involvement in the offence, are available. 

80It is true that this aspect of the matter received only passing reference in the submissions. Nevertheless, in my view, the applicant has not demonstrated that he has suffered any real prejudice in respect of this aspect of the matter. 

(d) The failure of police to promptly show eye-witnesses photographs of four potential suspects with goatee beards 

81Somewhat belatedly, the Crown produced photographs of each of the four persons whom counsel for the applicant described as potential suspects. The photographs were taken on 4 June 1995 after those persons were taken into custody at the Wetherill Park police station. The evidence reveals that Mark Hatch was arrested at about 11.45 pm on 3 June 1995 following a dispute with his neighbour which required the attendance of police. The Warnes brothers were each arrested at about 10.20 am on 4 June 1995 and charged with larceny. Billy Hillier was arrested at about 1.05 pm on 4 June 1995 and was also charged with larceny. The essential submission advanced on behalf of the Crown is that the only one of the four who could come close to meeting the description of an Australian/Caucasian male with a goatee beard with short cropped hair was Mr Hatch. It was submitted, and understandably so, that the Warnes brothers could be immediately eliminated as suspects because each of them had ""a full head of collar length hair"" at the time and neither had a goatee beard. The brothers were each interviewed in 1999 about the present matter. They each said that they had been heavy drug users, both in 1995, and when they were interviewed in 1999. For that reason, neither was able to shed any light on the matter. 

82The Crown intends to call Billy Hillier. He made a statement to police on 4 May 2011 in which he said that he is also known as Willy. The Crown contends that he can be excluded as a suspect because he was the person who provided the information to police about what had been said in the cells by the man with the goatee beard. Furthermore, the Crown contends that Mr Hillier can be excluded as a suspect because his photograph reveals a man who has neither a goatee beard nor short cropped hair. Counsel for the applicant however contends that his photograph did match the description which the eyewitness John Byrne provided to police in his initial statement. Mr Hillier also told police that he did not kill the deceased, but that otherwise he now has little recollection of the incident in the cells. 

83The Crown also sought to adduce material to show that Mark Hatch was the person in the cells who had bragged about the bashing. Without going into the finer detail of the matter, it is clear that that contention was based upon what Detective Willey conceded, in evidence, was merely an assumption on his part. Mr Hatch told police that that he did not recall speaking to anyone that evening apart from the police. He also told them that he knew nothing about the murder. 

84The Crown also led evidence that Mr Hatch's wife believed that he had been at home on the evening of the fatal incident. I accept the submission advanced by counsel for the applicant that little weight can be placed upon that assertion given that her statement was taken only recently about events which occurred in 1995. Although the Crown accepts that of the four persons in the cells, Mr Hatch is the one who most closely meets the description given by the eyewitnesses, it does not concede that he actually does meet it. For that reason, it submitted that there ""was no proper basis for the investigating police to show the photos of these four persons to witnesses in the Russell Lyons homicide investigation"". 

85The Crown also submitted that the link between the description provided by the eyewitnesses, and the information given by the man who was bragging in the cells, was somewhat tenuous. It was pointed out that no details were provided about any of the circumstances surrounding the alleged bashing, such as when, or indeed where, it is said to have occurred. Nor, it was submitted, was any description provided of the person who had been bashed. Moreover, according to Mr Hillier, the man in the cells claimed to have been acting in company whereas the Crown case is that the applicant, in attempting to rob the deceased, had acted alone. 

86Counsel for the applicant, on the other hand, submitted that the evidence demonstrated that each of those four persons was at large at the time of the fatal incident and could not, upon that basis, be excluded as a suspect. Counsel also submitted that the time, location and general description of the ""bashing"" all provided a link between the two events. Not surprisingly, counsel also emphasised the fact that the initial investigation team had clearly formed the view that there was such a link. 

87I do not have to finally resolve the issues which are raised by the competing submissions. That is because any prejudice which may have been occasioned to the applicant will be offset by the opportunity he will have of submitting to the jury that the failure of the police to investigate this aspect of the matter has the consequence that the Crown cannot exclude the reasonable possibility that it was one of the four men in the cells, who were said by police to have ""matched the description"" provided by eyewitnesses, who killed the deceased. 

88In those circumstances I am not persuaded, in respect of this issue, that the applicant has been able to demonstrate the existence of the kind of prejudice for which he contends. 

(e) The destruction of a pair of Nike running shoes 

89As I indicated earlier, the Nike shoes were located on the same morning and in the same general area as the Adidas shoes. Furthermore, there were ""possible"" blood stains on the front of one of the Nike shoes. It is clear that those shoes were regarded by police as having potential relevance to this investigation. No explanation has been, nor it appears can, be proffered for the destruction of the shoes. 

90Beyond that, it is impossible to state with any precision what significance the Nike shoes have in relation to the killing of the deceased, especially as they were located some little distance from the actual crime scene. Be that as it may, it remains a matter for speculation as to whether testing of the shoes would have assisted the applicant (or for that matter the Crown). To have any relevance it would presumably need to be established, as a bare minimum, that the substance found on the shoes was not only human blood, but that of the deceased. 

91However the apparent destruction of the shoes, particularly given the view taken at least by those involved in the initial investigation, that they had some significance in this matter, will undoubtedly provide the applicant with material upon which to criticise the Crown case. Moreover, it will enable the applicant to advance the submission that the Crown cannot exclude the reasonable possibility that those shoes were linked to this offence and that therefore someone other than the applicant was responsible for killing the deceased. 

92In those circumstances I am not persuaded, in respect of this issue, that the applicant has been able to demonstrate the existence of the kind of prejudice for which he contends. 

Conclusion 

93Although I have dealt with each of the matters in turn, I have not lost sight of the applicant's principal submission that it is the cumulative effect of the various factors which have been identified that gives rise to the need to grant a permanent stay. I have given full weight to all those considerations including the fact that the police investigation was, in significant respects, plainly deficient. In my view it is appropriate, as the Court said in Gilham (supra), to follow the approach adopted in Helmling (supra). To re-iterate, Hunt CJ at CL observed in that case that: 

What the applicant has lost therefore is the chance that he may have been able to do better; he has not lost the certainty that he would have done better. He had been permanently deprived of an opportunity simply to explore an avenue of inquiry which might have led to his acquittal. That may in some cases be sufficient, but they would in my view be rare. They would not usually produce the extreme situation which the authorities require . [at pp 7-8] [emphasis added] 

94I also acknowledge that even if prejudice to the applicant has been occasioned, that would not of itself, as was observed in Hatfield (supra), compel the conclusion that the trial would be necessarily unfair. 

95In my view, the applicant has failed to discharge the ""heavy onus"" which is cast upon him of establishing that the circumstances of the case warrant the granting of a permanent stay. In arriving at the conclusion that this is not a case in which ""exceptional circumstances"" exist, I have engaged in the ""weighing process"" referred to by the High Court in Walton v Gardiner (supra). As part of that exercise I have also had due regard to what the High Court described in Dupas (supra) as ""the need to take into account the substantial public interest of the community in having those charged with criminal offences brought to trial"". 

96Finally, it is pertinent to observe that the various matters which have been relied upon as being likely to give rise to prejudice are capable of being revisited during the course of the trial should the occasion arise: see Gilham (supra). In other words the applicant would not be precluded from making a further application for a stay if the circumstances warranted it. See Aydin (supra). Nor am I persuaded that it would be impossible to fashion appropriate directions or warnings to the jury to overcome any prejudice that exists or that may arise. That could extend to include reinforcement of any criticisms made by counsel about deficiencies in the Crown case. See Ulman-Naruniec (supra) [at para 42]; Penney (supra) [at para 17]. 

Order 

97The application for a permanent stay is refused.

2757105,Melham v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 121,"Judgment 

1MACFARLAN JA : I agree with Garling J. 

2JOHNSON J : I agree with Garling J. 

3GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of NSW by his Honour Judge Bennett on 19 July 2010. 

4The applicant, Mr Graeme Melham, pleaded guilty before Bennett DCJ to two offences. The first offence was being in possession of child pornography contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The second offence was that of using a carriage service to access child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). 

5The offences related to the use by the applicant of his personal computer to access, over the internet, child pornography material, download it and store it on his computer. 

6The maximum penalty for the offence pursuant to the NSW Act is imprisonment for 10 years. 

7The maximum penalty for the offence at that time, pursuant to the Commonwealth Criminal Code, is also imprisonment for 10 years. 

8There is no standard non-parole period applying to either of the offences. 

9In respect of the State offence, the sentencing judge, having allowed for a discount of 25 per cent, for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, imposed an overall sentence of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 19 July 2010 which was the date upon which the sentence was imposed. 

10In respect of the Commonwealth offence the sentencing judge imposed an overall sentence, again after allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty, of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 19 January 2011. 

11It can be observed that there was a period of 6 months by way of cumulation between the two offences. Ultimately, the sentence meant that the applicant will not be eligible for parole until the expiry of both of the non-parole periods, which will occur concurrently on 18 July 2013. 

Facts 

12The statement of agreed facts was tendered to the sentencing judge. A brief summary of those facts is set out below. 

13In late 2008, the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Operations Team received information in relation to the sharing of a child pornography file on the internet using Peer 2 Peer (P2P) software. P2P software enables direct connection and file sharing between two computers logged on to the internet. 

14Having received that information, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) identified the applicant as the owner of one of the internet protocol addresses that had been identified. 

15On Friday, 22 May 2009, members of the AFP executed a search warrant at the applicant's home address. An initial field examination revealed a number of video and image files depicting child pornography stored on the computer. 

16The computer equipment, including external hard drives, was seized and returned to the AFP premises and subjected to a careful examination. 

17The AFP established that there were 1196 multimedia files and 45182 image files located within all of the hard drives which had been seized. Each of these files was classified as child pornography. 

18The applicant accepted before the sentencing judge that the table below represents an accurate summary of the nature of the child pornography material held on the computer.

19The applicant participated in a recorded conversation with officers of the AFP and made the following admissions about his conduct: 

(a) He used the e-Mule P2P program on his computer to download the child pornography material; 

(b) The images and videos of child pornography which he downloaded were kept in a separate folder on the hard drives; 

(c) He had not informed his family about this conduct, he undertook it away from his family, usually late at night while his family was asleep, so his wife and children did not see or know what he was doing; 

(d) He had been undertaking the conduct for about ten years. He believed his conduct was both a problem and a sickness because he found that he could not stop himself from searching for and obtaining possession of child pornography material; 

(e) In order to find the child pornography material on the internet he undertook random searches during which he only looked for female children; 

(f) He was the only person with a password to use the computer that obtained the relevant child pornography material. 

20In the course of the interview, he told the AFP that he sought out the child pornography material because of ""self gratification"". It is convenient to note here that in the course of evidence before the sentencing judge, the applicant denied that this term referred to sexual gratification but said that it was a term which referred to the relieving of his anxiety through collection of the material. 

21On the day of the search, the applicant was arrested at his Prestons home. He was cooperative with the police. He was charged that day with the offences to which I have earlier referred. He was granted conditional bail. He remained on bail until Bennett DCJ pronounced his sentence. 

22On 12 March 2010, the applicant pleaded guilty to both offences in the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court. On 9 July 2010, when the proceedings were heard by Bennett DCJ, the applicant adhered to his pleas of guilty to each of the offences. 

Applicant's Submissions on Sentence 

23The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. Expert reports and evidence was tendered from Dr Olav Nielssen, a forensic psychiatrist, and Mr Stewart Perritt, who is a clinical psychologist. 

24There was further evidence from people who knew the applicant well, namely, Sister Anne Martin, a member of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart Order, and Father Peter Smith, the Parish Priest of Saint Francis Xavier's Parish at Leumeah. 

25Mr Walsh, the solicitor for the applicant, made extensive written submissions to the sentencing judge and also addressed him orally. 

26During submissions, Mr Walsh accepted that the child pornography material could only be appropriately categorised as ""... disgusting, abhorrent and repugnant"" . He accepted that the applicant's conduct was aggravated not only by the number of images and multimedia files involved but also by the nature of the subject matter displayed on them. However, he submitted correctly that the vast majority, in numerical terms, of the images were in the less serious categories of material. 

27He submitted that the context in which the applicant's behaviour occurred, was one which included his suffering of a mental illness for many years which manifested itself in different forms of anxiety, an obsession with collecting a variety of items including videos of film series, television episodes and the like. 

28Mr Walsh accepted that the applicant started collecting images of child pornography material, downloaded by the internet, from about 2002 onwards. He described his client's behaviour as "" dysfunctional and abhorrent "". 

29In oral submissions, Mr Walsh frankly conceded that, notwithstanding his client's denial of obtaining any sexual gratification from viewing the child pornography material, there must have been such a component in his behaviour. He said any other submission would be irrational. 

Subjective Features 

30The applicant was born on 15 June 1962 and was aged 47 at the time of his arrest. He will shortly turn 49. 

31He had no prior history of any offences or convictions. The evidence established that in every respect, other than the offending conduct, the applicant was a good man. He was a good family man who looked after and participated fully in life with his wife and three children. 

32He was the Chairman of the Pastoral Council of his parish church. He was involved in a number of activities within the parish, assisting generally with the parish works, and assisting members who were in particular need. He held a senior position in the NSW public service. 

33The applicant grew up in a family where his father had a severe depressive illness for over 25 years which had resulted in four inpatient admissions for treatment with electro-convulsive therapy. The applicant's father had been a problem gambler and a compulsive collector which had been associated with an anxiety state. The applicant's three siblings had each suffered from depression at some stage during their adult life. 

34The applicant had himself suffered several periods of depression during his adult life from which he seemed to have recovered without treatment. In about 2002, he consulted a general practitioner for treatment of depression and for assistance with his compulsive behaviour. He was not prescribed any antidepressant medication nor was he referred for further assessment or counselling. He was prescribed an over-the-counter medication to assist him to relax. 

35This treatment did not remediate any of the aspects of his illness. 

36Shortly after being charged, the applicant had suicidal ideation, took an overdose of sedative medication and was admitted to the Psychiatric Emergency Care Centre at Liverpool Hospital for four days. He then spent some time in a private psychiatric hospital during which he was prescribed an antidepressant medication. 

37Prior to his sentencing, the applicant had been engaged in a period of almost 12 months of counselling with Mr Perritt, which together with the antidepressant medication he had been prescribed, seemed to provide some improvement in his condition. 

38Dr Nielssen diagnosed him as suffering from a major depression which was in partial remission. He described the disorder as being in partial remission because the applicant did not seem to him to be ""pervasively depressed"" and because the applicant had reported to him that he had recovered from the more severe phase of the illness as the result of treatment with antidepressant medication and counselling. 

39Dr Nielssen concluded, as did Mr Perritt and Ms Youssef, a forensic psychologist who compiled a psychological presentence assessment, that the applicant was at low risk of reoffending. 

40At the time of the sentencing hearing, the applicant maintained, notwithstanding the offences and their effect upon his family, a close relationship with his wife and children who continued to support him. 

41The applicant's counsel conceded before Bennett DCJ that the nature of the offences was such that a sentence of full time imprisonment was appropriate and that a sentence which did not contain any full time imprisonment component would be contrary to principle. 

Remarks on Sentence 

42The sentencing judge carefully reviewed the objective and subjective features of the offences and the submissions which had been made. 

43He found that the applicant suffered from an obsessive compulsive disorder although he rejected the proposition that this disorder was solely the cause of the offence. He found that the applicant had ""... at least some interest in the product that has brought him before this Court ... The interest could not have been other than a sexual interest "". 

44He noted that there was no allegation that the applicant had disseminated any of the material stored on his computer to anyone else. 

45He summarised his conclusion in this way: 

""The evidence that the offender has suffered depression and anxiety over the years with an evolving obsessive compulsive behaviour pattern is compelling. I am persuaded that his collecting of all of the programs and movies and the adult and child pornography is a manifestation of that. I am satisfied however that the child pornography was of sexual interest to the offender as was the adult pornography. He knew it was wrong to access it and to have it. It was necessary for him to do so to assuage a compulsion to collect."" 

46His Honour found, having considered the objective criminality involved, including the nature and content of the material, the age of the children who were photographed or filmed, the depravity involved in the activities portrayed, the large number of images and the large number of different children who were depicted and victimised in the material, that the offending fell within mid-range. 

47He found that having regard to the time at which the plea of guilty was entered, that it was at the earliest reasonably available opportunity and accordingly, it was appropriate to allow a discount of 25 per cent from any sentence that might otherwise be imposed. 

48He found that the applicant was anxious to achieve rehabilitation, and that he had prospects of rehabilitation that would be realised upon proper management of his counselling treatment. 

49His Honour considered individually each of the various subsections of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and also s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). It will be necessary to deal with this part of his Honour's judgment in due course when dealing with the particular grounds of appeal in this respect. 

50Finally, before imposing sentence, his Honour drew attention to the principles discussed by Sperling J in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]. His Honour noted that there was "" some contribution to this offending "" from elements of his obsessive compulsive disorder which provided some mitigation but ""... only to a moderate degree "". 

Grounds of Appeal 

51Five grounds of appeal were relied upon by the applicant: 

1. That the learned sentencing judge erred in rejecting the proposition that the offender collected the images by way of a compulsive process; 

2. That the learned sentencing judge erred in rejecting the offender's evidence and that of the experts as to the reasons for his offending behaviour; 

3. That his Honour erred in finding aggravating conduct pursuant to s 21A(2)(m) and (n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act involving multiple criminal acts and planned or organised activity; 

4. That his Honour erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor s 21A(2)(g) and (l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act involving harm suffered, vulnerability and multiplicity of victims; 

5. That the sentencing imposed by the learned sentencing judge was manifestly excessive having regard to the objective and subjective features of the offence. 

Grounds 1 and 2 

52These grounds can conveniently be considered together because they deal with the issue of the applicant's mental health, the evidence by which that condition was proved, and its causal effect on the applicant's conduct. 

53With respect to these two grounds of appeal, the appellant's submission is that the sentencing judge wrongly rejected the applicant's evidence that his accessing the child pornography material over the internet and his possession of that material was caused by his mental illnesses which comprised depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. The applicant submitted that the obsessive nature of the underlying psychiatric illness was interlinked with the nature of the appellant's psychiatric presentation and ""... coupled with other subjective features, meant this was not a case that would otherwise require 'condign punishment'. "" 

54The written submission in these terms was somewhat opaque. 

55When developed in oral submissions, it seemed that the applicant was submitting that whilst, he accepted, that in objective terms there was an element of sexual interest involved in the applicant's behaviour in accessing child pornography, that was not the predominant feature. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge had therefore not given sufficient weight to the subjective element of the applicant's mental illness when imposing sentence. 

56The authorities in this and other courts provide that mental illness may be relevant in a number of ways in the sentencing process. 

57In the first place, if an offender's mental illness contributes materially in a causative sense to the commission of an offence, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced with the result that there may not then be the same requirement for denunciation of the conduct and hence the punishment warranted may be reduced: Hemsley at [33]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [21], [23]-[26]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [23]-[26]; Leach v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 73 at [10]-[12]. 

58Secondly, a mental illness may mean that in the case of a particular offender, the principle of general deterrence may need to be moderated: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Israil at [22]; Hemsley at [34]. 

59Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Israil at [26]; Hemsley at [35]. 

60Fourthly, a mental illness may impact upon the need to address specific deterrence, either by way of moderation of penalty, or else eliminated: Verdins at [32]; Leach at [10]. 

61The learned sentencing judge made it clear in his judgment that he accepted the psychiatric evidence of the psychologists and Dr Nielssen that the applicant had an obsessive compulsive disorder and that he suffered from the mental illnesses of which evidence was given. However, on the basis of what Dr Nielssen said, his Honour was not satisfied that the mental illness was the sole reason for the applicant to undertake the conduct concerned and that his sexual interest in child pornography was manifest. 

62His Honour concluded in these terms which I have earlier set out, but which bear repeating here: 

""The evidence that the offender has suffered depression and anxiety over the years with an evolving obsessive compulsive behaviour pattern is compelling. I am persuaded that his collecting of all of the programs and movies and the adult and child pornography is a manifestation of that. I am satisfied however that the child pornography was of sexual interest to the offender as was the adult pornography. He knew it was wrong to access it and to have it. It was not necessary for him to do so to assuage a compulsion to collect. He recognised as much when he said that he discarded his holdings entirely a year before but then returned to its collection."" 

63That conclusion was then referred to by his Honour when he later said in his judgment this: 

""I have reminded myself of what Sperling J said in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at paras 33-36 where his Honour discussed the principles relevant to impaired mental health. Upon the findings I have made there is some evidence to show that there has been some contribution to this offending from the obsessive-compulsive collection of material and it does provide some mitigation but in my judgment only to a moderate degree. It remains that in my judgment the offender had an interest in the child pornography to have engaged upon its collection in such vast quantities."" 

64The symptoms of the mental illness to which the sentencing judge was referring included the habit of the applicant collecting in large quantities videos, television programs, electrical leads and cables, and the like. 

65It is clear that the learned sentencing judge had regard to the appropriate principles of law and made findings that were largely favourable to the applicant. 

66In so far as the learned judge rejected the applicant's subjective explanation that his mental illness was the cause of his crime, the learned judge did so based upon the expert evidence of Dr Nielssen and other evidence which surrounded the commission of the crime. 

67I can detect no error in the approach of the learned sentencing judge. The learned sentencing judge allocated weight to the issue of the applicant's mental illness. The learned sentencing judge was persuaded that there was a moderate impact of the mental illness on the criminal conduct of the applicant. 

68The submission of the applicant that the learned trial judge gave insufficient weight to this feature is not one that this Court will readily embrace. As Spigelman CJ said in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]: 

""Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstances in which matters of ""weight"" will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined."" 

69This is not an example of a case in which this Court should interfere with respect to these grounds. I would not uphold the appeal on either of these grounds. 

Grounds 3 and 4 

70Each of these grounds raise error on the basis that the sentencing judge took into account as an aggravating factor matters which were inappropriate so to do. 

71The grounds raise the provisions of ss 21A(2)(g), (l), (m) and (n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , which apply only to the State offence. The provisions have no application to the Commonwealth offence. 

72Section 21A(2) of that Act provides that the Court is to take into account as an aggravating factor a variety of matters including: 

""(g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial, 

... 

(l) the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim's occupation (such as a taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller, or service station attendant), 

(m) the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts, 

(n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity,"" 

73The applicant submitted that it was an error for the learned sentencing judge to have regard to each of these matters as aggravating circumstances, particularly where the essential elements of the offences were such that the subject matter of the aggravating factors were necessary to be considered in any event. 

74The Crown accepted, in its oral submissions to the Court, that the learned sentencing judge had erroneously taken these matters into account as aggravating circumstances. However, the Crown submitted that whilst the sentencing judge was not entitled to treat the applicant's conduct as containing aggravating features for the purposes of the legislation to which I have referred above, the sentencing judge was nevertheless entitled to take those matters into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending. 

75As well, the Crown submitted that to the extent that there was any error, it affected only the NSW offence and not the Commonwealth offence. 

76It is important then to understand the way in which the learned sentencing judge drew attention to these ""aggravating factors"". 

77Having described all of the objective circumstances of the offence, the learned sentencing judge concluded that the offending fell within the mid-range of seriousness. 

78He then proceeded to note the submissions which directed his attention to the various subparagraphs of s 21A(2) to which I have referred above. He said that he would have regard to those matters. He said: "" I bring these factors to account "". 

79It is not clear to me that his Honour regarded these aggravating factors as being of sufficient seriousness to warrant viewing the nature of the offending as falling anywhere above the mid-range. Indeed, the sentence which his Honour imposed suggests that he regarded the totality of all features of the offending as falling within the mid-range. 

80I accept that the learned judge was in error in referring to these as aggravating factors. I do not accept however that as a consequence of that error the result reached by his Honour in an assessment of the seriousness of the offending was in error. It would be hard to describe the seriousness of the offending in anything less than mid-range. 

81I do not think that the error which is accepted between the parties has occasioned any substantive effect in his Honour's judgment, nor do I think that that error has occasioned any miscarriage of justice. 

82I would not uphold the appeal on these grounds. 

Ground 5 

83Ground 5 submits that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly excessive. 

84The maximum penalty for each of the offences was 10 years imprisonment. There was no standard non-parole period fixed by the legislation. The sentence imposed for the offences which the judge regarded as being in the mid-range of seriousness was an overall non-parole period of 3 years. 

85The relevant test for the applicant to succeed on this ground requires the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J. In approaching the task of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the Court does so within the context that there is no one single correct sentence, but rather the process of sentencing involves due allowance for differences of judicial opinion at first instance whilst still acting in accordance with principle: Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] per Hoeben J (Tobias JA and James J agreeing); Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16]-[17] per Hodgson JA (Buddin and Price JJ agreeing); Hayek v R [2010] NSWCCA 139 at [37] per McCallum J (Simpson and Johnson JJ agreeing). 

86The submissions of the applicant on this ground can be summarised in this way: 

(a) The applicant accepted that his conduct in the commission of the offences was extremely serious and that the number of images, the nature and content of them, and the period of time over which he had been accessing, downloading and viewing the child pornography material were significant; 

(b) When assessing the objective criminality involved in the offence, it was necessary to keep in mind that the applicant was not involved in any dissemination of the subject material, its communication to others, or engaged in any profit-making exercise with respect to that material; 

(c) The applicant had a very strong subjective case; 

(d) Whilst general deterrence was of importance, the weight to be given to general deterrence in this case was less by reason of the applicant's mental illness. 

87The applicant also provided reference to a series of other cases, in which the sentences were less than that which had been imposed in this case by the sentencing judge. 

88It is necessary to keep in mind when reviewing the cases which are said to be comparable that in many of those cases the maximum penalty for the State offence was only 5 years, whereas in more recent times the NSW legislature has increased the maximum penalty to 10 years. The applicant's crime occurred after the increase in penalty by the legislature. 

89The applicant accepted that in accordance with Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [30]-[31] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, it was a relevant factor to have regard to the maximum available sentences for offences. However, the applicant submitted that regard to those maximum penalties needed to be balanced with all of relevant factors in the particular case: See R v Poynder [2007] NSWCCA 157 at [84]. 

90A careful reading of the cases to which the applicant drew attention, demonstrates, as one might expect, a variety of penalties reflecting a combination of different offences and a variation in the facts involved in each offence. 

91I accept that reference to the cases nominated demonstrate that the sentence in this case falls at the high end of the range of sentences imposed for similar offences. But the question remains whether it falls within the range of the permissible exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion. In my opinion, having regard to the circumstances outlined earlier, it does. 

92The factors which the sentencing judge was entitled properly to have regard to, and to which he did have regard, demonstrate that the offending fell within the mid-range. There were a large number of images, the nature and content of those images included quite vile and abhorrent images, the number of different children involved in the images was very large, probably about 1000 or so, and the time period over which the applicant had access to these images by searching on the internet for them, downloading them, and holding them on his computer, was a significant one. 

93True it is that the applicant had strong subjective features, but taking into account all of the purposes of sentencing, and particularly the objective features of the criminality to which I have referred, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed for both offences fell outside the range of discretion properly open to the judge. 

94In my opinion, the applicant has not shown that the sentence imposed was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" nor that any lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

95This ground ought also be rejected. 

Orders 

96I propose these orders: 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 

(2) Appeal dismissed.

2757126,"MADUBUKO, Henry Ugo v R [2011] NSWCCA 135","Judgment 

1HODGSON JA: On 13 October 2008 the appellant and two co-accused, Ms Saripah Syed Basri and Mr Ifeanyi Okonkwo, were arraigned before Nicholson DCJ on drug charges. 

2The charge against Ms Basri was that she, on 25 February 2008, at Sydney New South Wales, did import a substance, the substance being a border-controlled drug, namely, heroin, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity. 

3The charge against the appellant and against Mr Okonkwo was that they, on 25 February 2008, at Sydney New South Wales, did attempt to possess a substance, being a border-controlled drug, namely heroin, which had been unlawfully imported and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity. 

4All accused pleaded not guilty, and they were tried together before Nicholson DCJ and a jury. 

5On 4 November 2008, the jury returned verdicts of guilty against all three co-accused. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for six years six months, with a non-parole period of four years two months, to date from 25 February 2008. The appellant appeals from his conviction. 

6At the trial, there was a statement of facts agreed to by the three co-accused and the Crown: 

1. On 12 February 2008 Ms Basri was issued with a 6 month visa allowing her to enter India. 

2. On 13 February 2008 Ms Basri was issued with an airline ticket by Festive Travels S.B. in Jalan Tun Sambathan, Brickfields Kuala Lumpur for flights booked: 

a. Air India flight 433 from Kuala Lumpur to Delhi on 14 February 2008; and 

b. Air India flight 432 from Delhi to Kuala Lumpur on 18 March 2008. 

3. On 14 February 2008 Ms Basri travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Delhi on air India flight 433 arriving in Delhi on 14 February 2008. 

4. Ms Basri spent about 10 days in Delhi before leaving for Mumbai by air. Upon arriving in Mumbai she transferred to Qantas international flight QF124 from Mumbai to Sydney. 

5. At about 2.56pm on Monday 25 February 2008 Ms Basri arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport, Mascot, on board Qantas Flight QF124 from Mumbai, India. In India, Ms Basri had checked into hold luggage a single black-coloured trolley-style suitcase, ""American Tourister"" brand, measuring approximately 74cm long, 40cm wide and 25cm high. 

6. Upon arrival of QF124 [at] Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport and prior to Ms Basri's suitcase being sent onto the carousel delivery point, it was seized and inspected by members of the Australian Customs Service and Australian Federal Police. 

7. Ms Basri's suitcase was found to contain a package concealed within the lining of the suitcase. 

8. The package weighed 3.2kg total (that is, including the package wrapping and its contents). 

9. The package was found to contain 3.045kg of brown powder, which tested positive for heroin. 

10. Later testing showed powder to be 61.8% pure heroin, meaning the package found concealed within Ms Basri's suitcase contained 1.881kg of heroin. 

11. The package was removed from the suitcase by officers of the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police and replaced with an inert substance. 

12. Australian Customs Officers found US$1,500 cash (being 15 x US$100 notes) in Ms Basri's handbag. 

13. When spoken to Ms Basri denied all knowledge of her suitcase containing prohibited drugs. 

14. The Australian Federal Police tested the package concealed in Ms Basri's suitcase and removed at the airport for fingerprints and DNA evidence. No evidence was found to link any defendant to the package of drugs removed from the bag at the airport. 

15. None of the accused is previously known to Police and [each] has no criminal record. 

16. Ms Basri agreed to assist Police by taking the suitcase to a location she had been given information about in what is known as a 'controlled delivery'. 

17. After the controlled delivery of Ms Basri's suitcase had taken place at Bankstown, and upon search, Mr Madabuko was found to have US$1,000 (being 10 x US$100 notes). Ms Basri had US$500 remaining in her possession after the controlled delivery. 

7Other significant evidence in the Crown case against the appellant came from officers of the Australian Federal Police involved in the controlled delivery referred to in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the agreed statement, and from surveillance running sheets created by AFP officers. 

8This evidence included the following, which was not the subject of dispute: 

(1) At about 4.25pm at the AFP office at the airport Ms Basri's mobile phone rang. She thereafter had a phone conversation, and after that conversation Ms Basri said words to the effect that ""they"" wanted to know if she had her bag and told her about going to the hotel, which Ms Basri identified as the Bankstown Travelodge. 

(2) There were other mobile phone calls to Ms Basri, including one at about 4.37pm, after which Ms Basri said words to the effect that ""He wants me to go to the reception of the hotel and book a room."" 

(3) A little later Ms Basri said she had been given the United States money in India, that 500 was to pay the hotel and things like that, and she was told to give 1000 to the friend she was going to meet here. 

(4) While police were escorting Ms Basri to the hotel, her mobile phone rang. She had a conversation after which she said ""They wanted to know where I was and I said I was in a taxi going to the hotel."" 

(5) At about 6.10pm at the hotel Ms Basri's mobile phone rang. She had a conversation, after which she said she had told them she was going to room 415. 

(6) At about 7.00pm in room 415 Ms Basri's mobile phone rang. She had a conversation, after which she said words to the effect that ""They want me to go to the car park of the hotel"" and she said she was on her way there. 

9This body of evidence also included the following evidence supported by running sheets, which were not the subject of dispute. 

(1) Ms Basri was observed to go to the car park of the hotel with a black suitcase, and wait there from 7.12pm to 7.28pm, when she was observed using a mobile phone. 

(2) Between 7.20 and 7.30 the appellant and Mr Okonkwo were observed in Stewart Lane Bankstown, near the Travelodge, walking up and down with both appearing to use a mobile phone several times. 

(3) At 7.29pm Ms Basri, still wheeling the black suitcase, left the hotel, walked into Mona Street and through a car park towards Stewart Lane, and then to the end of the car park where she appeared to have a conversation with the appellant and Mr Okonkwo. 

(4) Then the appellant and Mr Okonkwo walked up Stewart Lane with Ms Basri following them, still wheeling the black suitcase. 

(5) When they got to Chapel Road South outside the Westpac Bank, Ms Basri and the appellant appeared to have a conversation. 

(6) Ms Basri and the appellant walked down Chapel Road South and went out of sight and Mr Okonkwo followed a couple of minutes later. 

(7) A couple of minutes later again, a car with Mr Okonkwo as driver and the appellant as front passenger reversed out of a parking spot on Chapel Road South. 

That car was stopped and the black suitcase was found in the rear of the vehicle. Also found under the passenger seat of the vehicle was a mobile phone with text messages including a message ""No room 415"". The appellant and Mr Okonkwo were then arrested. 

10Neither the appellant nor Mr Okonkwo participated in any interview with police, but Ms Basri did and her record of interview (ROI) was admitted against her. 

11The trial judge told the jury at the commencement of the trial that the ROI was not admissible against the appellant or Mr Okonkwo. However, towards the end of the trial Mr Okonkwo's counsel took an AFP officer to the interview in cross-examination, leading to an application by the Crown to have the ROI admitted against Mr Okonkwo. Ultimately Mr Okonkwo consented to this. 

12The question as to what should then happen was discussed in terms showing that the trial judge was alive to the possibility of prejudice from the admission of the ROI against Mr Okonkwo and not against the appellant. However, ultimately the trial judge rejected an application for a separate trial of the appellant, saying that he would publish his reasons later. No such reasons were later published. 

13None of the defendants gave evidence at the trial. 

14The Crown address and the trial judge's summing up several times referred to the ROI not being admitted against the appellant, and explained the need to consider the case against each defendant separately on the basis of evidence admissible against that defendant. 

15The appellant relies on the following ground of appeal: That the learned trial judge erred in not granting the appellant a separate trial from Ms Syed Basri and Mr Okonkwo. 

16Dr Glennon, for the appellant, referred the Court to the cases of R v Middis (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 27 March 1991, unreported), KRM v R [2001] HCA 11; (2001) 206 CLR 221 at [38] and R v Piller (1995) 86 A Crim R 249. 

17Dr Glennon pointed to what he submitted were prejudicial matters in the ROI, notably matters set out as follows in his written submissions: 

Q.78- That she went from Malaysia to India to obtain work. 
Q.89- She was to go to Australia to meet Gina's brother. 
Q.94- In Australia she was to meet a guy. 
Q.95- She thought the person she was to meet in Australia was Indian. 
Q.381- Person she went to see in India was Gina. 
Q.392- She stayed with Gina and her boyfriend in India. 
Q.467- Johnnie [the boyfriend of Gina) spoke Nigerian and was Nigerian. 
Q.472- Johnnie had mostly Nigerian friends. 
Q.476- Gina pleaded with her to take Sari's and Punjabi suits to Gina's brother in Australia. 
Q.478- Gina gave her $1,500 - $1,000 for her to give to Gina's brother in Australia to pay for her ticket to return. 
Q.484- She didn't realise that Gina's brother could change colour to be black, she assumed that he would be Indian like Gina. 
Q.498- Johnnie gave her the money, it was he who kept ringing her when she got to Australia. 
Q.502- Johnnie mentioned the room number, and that the guys were black, then he told her black guys would meet her -she had assumed Indian. 
Q.503- Johnnie was Gina's boyfriend. 
Q.505- Johnnie told her two black guys were outside (hotel in Bankstown ). 
Q.506 - Johnnie told her black guys Were near the bus stop (in Bankstown). 
Q.618- Contact details were given to her by a Nigerian. 

18Dr Glennon submitted that the jury had been told at the beginning of the trial that they could not use the ROI against either Mr Okonkwo or the appellant, so that when they were later told they could use it against Mr Okonkwo, it was unrealistic to expect that they could put prejudicial material aside in considering the appellant's case. Also, he submitted, the late change from the ROI being admitted only against Ms Basri unfairly put a spotlight on the ROI in the eyes of the jury. 

19Dr Glennon referred to references in the Crown address and the summing up to the ROI, and submitted that these references had the potential to highlight the prejudice by drawing attention to what was clearly stated by Ms Basri in her record of interview touching on issues relevant to the appellant's case. 

20Dr Glennon submitted that the trial judge fell into error in not giving reasons for the decision to refuse the appellant's application for a separate trial, and referred to Kennedy v R [2008] NSWCCA 21; (2008) 181 A Crim R 185 at [25[-[26]. 

21Finally, he submitted that the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ought not to be applied. 

22Considering first the question of failure to give reasons, such failure does generally constitute an error of law where reasons are appropriate, but this does not necessarily require that an appeal be upheld. In particular, if the matter as to which reasons are not given is one on which an appeal court can come to its own view, and if that view is that the result arrived at by the primary judge was correct, then normally an appeal would be dismissed. 

23In the present case, in my opinion there was no significant advantage to the trial judge over this Court in determining whether a separate trial should be granted. There was in fact no significant issue of credibility in the case. The real question in the case was what inferences should be drawn from primary facts which were not substantially in dispute. The case of Kennedy referred to by Dr Glennon was one where the deficiency of reasons supported an inference that the sentencing judge in that case had overlooked material matters, and the Court of Criminal Appeal reached its own view, contrary to that of the sentencing judge. 

24I note that in Evans v R [2006] NSWCCA 277 James J, with Hidden and Hoeben JJ agreeing, rejected a ground of appeal relying on the failure of the trial judge to give reasons, saying this: 

[271] The various rulings her Honour made were significant rulings and the appellant was entitled to have reasons given by her Honour for her rulings, particularly where reasons were requested and her Honour undertook to provide reasons. See Harris v R NSWCCA (2005) 432 at para 21 per Studdert J on behalf of the Court. 

[272] Her Honour was remiss in not stating, even if quite succinctly, her reasons for a number of her rulings. However, I do not consider that her Honour's failure to state her reasons in separate judgments amounted, as was submitted by counsel for the appellant, to such a fundamental procedural irregularity as to warrant setting aside the appellant's convictions. All, or almost all, of the applications by counsel for the appellant at the trial were argued at considerable length. The competing submissions of the parties were stated and, indeed, often repeated a number of times. The views the trial judge was forming on each application were revealed by frequent remarks made by her in the course of the argument. I consider that in the present case it can be inferred from the transcript of the argument what were her Honour's reasons for making each of her rulings and it is possible for this Court to determine whether her Honour erred in making the rulings. 

[273] Counsel for the appellant referred to Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250. However, Fleming , while of some indirect relevance, was a case of a trial by a judge alone. 

25In my opinion, failure to give reasons in this case was not a fundamental procedural irregularity. However, it is appropriate for this Court to reach its own view on whether a separate trial should have been ordered. 

26The Crown relied on principles of law in relation to separate trials stated in Middis , referring to a statement by Sully J, with Spigelman CJ and Hislop J agreeing, in Friend v R [2007] NSWCCA 41 at [147] that ""The guiding principles of law are not in doubt: they are summarised by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Middis unreported, 17 March 1991)."" 

27However, I do not think this means that the summary was exhaustive and definitive. There was a useful further discussion of principle by Sheller JA, James J and Smart AJ agreeing in Symss v R [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [66-76]: 

[66] On 28 November 2000 Simpson J refused to order separate trials. The application for a separate trial was renewed before the trial Judge who refused it. Counsel for the appellant submitted to Howie J that the prejudice which would flow from a joint trial where Masson made assertions in his ERISPs about the appellant having committed armed robberies and having an association with a bikie gang, could not be cured by directions. In a passage already quoted, his Honour said: 

""This is the quintessential cut-throat defence case in which each of the accused has given versions of the incident giving rise to the charge to police which implicate the co-offender and exculpate himself."" 

[67] The trial Judge said that there would be no evidence led in the trial to prove the truth of any of these allegations. The Crown did not seek to prove them. He noted that the Crown's case was that most of what Masson said in his statements to the police was false. The only relevance of the assertions against the appellant was that it ""caused [Masson] to remain with Symss and to accompany him to Broken Hill, notwithstanding that he knew that Symss had murdered the deceased."" In his further notes of argument the appellant relied upon his submissions under ground 2 about the effect of the admission of prejudicial evidence against him. 

[68] The decision whether or not to grant separate trials involves a consideration of the interests of justice, including conserving costs, the avoidance of inconvenience to witnesses and the desirability of common enterprises being jointly tried so as to avoid inconsistent verdicts. 

[69] In an unreported decision of 27 March 1991, in R v Middis 70412 of 1990, Hunt J said on the question of whether there should be separate trials: 

""Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 

1. where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him, and 

2. where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him, and 

3. where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, 

a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial."" 

[70] A little later in his judgment at p5 Hunt J said: 

""I do not believe that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Oliver [(1984) 57 ALR 543] intended an applicant for a separate trial to demonstrate that positive injustice would more likely than not be caused by a joint trial (as it was suggested in argument); nor do I accept that a mere possibility of prejudice is sufficient (as it was also suggested in argument). In my view, what the Court of Criminal Appeal was saying was that, as some prejudice to one or other accused is inevitable in any joint trial, it must be shown by an applicant for a separate trial that the particular prejudice upon which reliance is placed by him would - if it arises - result in positive injustice to him in a joint trial."" 

[71] In Webb and Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 88-89 Toohey J, with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed, said on the question of whether there should have been separate trials: 

""King CJ dealt with this ground by pointing out that there are 'strong reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together. That is particularly so where each seeks to cast the blame on the other.' R v Webb and Hay (1992) 59 SASR 563 at 585. What King CJ referred to as 'strong reasons of principle and policy' were discussed by his Honour in R v Collie (1991) 56 SASR 302 at 307-311. I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasises that when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prima facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others R v Demirok (1976) VR 244 at 254. There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused R v Harbach (1973) 6 SASR 427 at 433. 

In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice, or put another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused. 

In the present case adequate directions were given by the trial judge. It is true that Webb did not give evidence and was therefore not subject to cross-examination, though the jury heard his statements to the police implicating Hay. But, as King CJ observed (1992) 59 SASR at 585: 'That is a commonplace feature of a joint trial and does not of itself render separate trials necessary.' Properly instructed by the trial judge, as they were, the jury were capable of appreciating the use they could make of evidence as against each of the appellants. It has not been shown that a substantial miscarriage of justice is likely to have occurred."" 

[72] In R v Patsalis and Spathis (1999) 107 A Crim R 432 Kirby J refused an application for separate trials which was opposed not only by the Crown but also by the co-accused. In his reasons for judgment, which on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal (2001) NSWCCA 476 at 148, Heydon JA, as his Honour then was, described at 148 as a model of their kind, Kirby J said at 434: 

""There is a rule, and a proviso to that rule. It is desirable, in the ordinary course, that all persons said to have been concerned with the one crime should be dealt with in the one trial. That rule is subject to the proviso that, if a joint trial would cause positive injustice to an accused, then a separate trial should be ordered; R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543."" 

[73] Dealing with cut-throat defences Kirby J referred to the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 and to Webb and Hay . In Ignjatic Hunt CJ at CL, after referring to earlier decisions, said at 339,: 

""Obviously, there will be cases in which cut-throat defences are raised where it may be appropriate to order separate trials, but they would not in my view arise frequently . In a proper summing up, the jury will be directed separately in relation to the evidence admissible against each accused; Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 455. The undoubted prejudice created by such an unsworn statement by a co-accused in a joint trial is usually considerably lessened in such circumstance, and thus it would not amount to the positive injustice required to warrant separate trials."" (emphasis added) 

[74] In this Court in Fernando (1999) NSWCCA 66 the trial judge had refused to order separate trials. The Court identified the issue which gave rise to the application for separate trials in these words at para 220: 

""The tenor of Brendon Fernando's statements to the police was that while he was present during most of the events which occurred he was subject to the control of Vester Fernando, who was armed with a machete. Indeed, he stated to the police at the time when the victim was killed he was not present, having left the company of Vester Fernando and the victim shortly before the lethal event must have occurred. Thus, while his statements may not be considered as being a complete 'cut-throat' defence they are certainly exculpatory to a degree of his own participation and thoroughly implicate Vester Fernando."" 

[75] Brendon Fernando did not give evidence so that his statements were not capable of being tested by either the Crown Prosecutor or Vester Fernando's counsel. Even so, the Court said at para 222: 

""However, his recorded admissions do, in the Court's view, fall within the type of evidence adverted to in the authorities and particularly by Toohey J in Webb and Hay which support the contention that there ought to have been a joint trial."" 

[76] For present purposes I regard it as sufficient to emphasise the factors identified by King CJ in Collie and Webb and Hay and adopted by Toohey J in Webb and Hay in the High Court. There are important reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together, particularly where each seeks to cast the blame on the other. The dangers from the admission of evidence which would not have been admitted if the appellant had stood trial alone can be obviated by express and careful directions as were given in this trial. 

28An explanation and possible qualification to what was said in Middis was expressed as follows by Adams J, with Spigelman CJ agreeing and Hulme J expressing no disagreement, in R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 at [38-40]: 

[38] In R v Baartman (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal 6 October 1994) this Court approved the following summary of the relevant principles enunciated by Hunt J in R v Middis (unreported, NSWSC 27 March 1991), an approval repeated by Fernando [1999] NSWCCA at [210] - 


""Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 

1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and 

2. Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and 

3. Where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial."" 

[39] Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, ""immeasurably"" usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant ""significant, though incommensurable"". The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to ""positive injustice"". Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence. 

[40] I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant's case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender's case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused's case was weak, or weaker than the applicant's, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury's consideration of the applicant's case. 

29I agree with those views expressed by Adams J. 

30In Pham , an appeal was allowed on the basis of a failure to order separate trials where a record of interview given by one accused was admitted, with a jury being told it was not evidence against the other accused. In that case there were two eyewitnesses, who gave evidence against both accused and whose credit was questionable and was strongly attacked. The record of interview was supportive of the account given by these eyewitnesses, and the Court considered that the jury could not separately form two assessments of the credibility of these witnesses, one assessment using the record of interview and the other ignoring it. I note that no similar issue arises in this case where, as I have said, there was no significant dispute as to the primary facts. 

31It was submitted for the Crown that the first of the three requirements stated by Hunt CJ at CL in Middis was not satisfied in this case, in that the evidence against the appellant was not ""significantly weaker"" than that against Mr Okonkwo, since the appellant was found with $US1,000 and he was seen to walk out of sight with Ms Basri. Whether or not that is so, for the reasons given by Adams J in Pham , I do not think this would, in any event, necessarily be fatal to the appellant's appeal. 

32In my opinion the primary question is whether there was a significant risk that prejudicial material in the ROI, which was not admissible against the appellant, could have turned a potential acquittal to a conviction. If that was the case, this could amount to a positive injustice requiring the ordering of separate trials. 

33Dr Glennon relied particularly on matters in the ROI dealing with the fact that despite Ms Basri's initial belief that her friend Gina's brother would meet her, who she assumed must be Indian like Gina, she was told by Gina's boyfriend, Johnny, that she was to meet two black guys. In my opinion, neither that material, nor any other material in the ROI, was materially prejudicial; and to the extent that there might have been some risk of prejudice, the risk was at most slight and was such as could have been overcome by appropriate directions and, in fact, was so overcome. 

34The evidence of frequent mobile phone calls, the arrangement to meet the person to whom the bag was to be given in the car park of the hotel, the subsequent movements of Ms Basri following another apparent mobile phone call to encounter the appellant and Mr Okonkwo in the vicinity of Stewart Lane, the subsequent movements of Ms Basri and Mr Okonkwo and the appellant, and the reappearance of the appellant and Mr Okonkwo in a car with the suitcase a couple of minutes later, overwhelmingly supported the inference that the appellant was a person that Ms Basri was, pursuant to the phone calls, to meet to hand over the suitcase. 

35In addition, the finding of ten $US100 notes in the possession of the appellant and five $US100 notes remaining in the possession of Ms Basri overwhelmingly supported the inference that there was a transaction in which Ms Basri gave the appellant ten of the fifteen $US100 notes, which she had had in her possession, which she had said to the AFP officers at the airport that she had been told to give to the friend she was going to meet here. 

36Having regard to all that evidence, in my view, what was in the ROI concerning two black guys added little, if anything, of significance. 

37In my view, the appellant's attempted reliance on the content of the Crown address and the summing up do not directly go to the ground of appeal, since these matters occurred after the decision complained about. No further application was made to the trial judge for a separate trial of the appellant after that decision. It could, however, be said that what happened after that decision simply showed the prejudice that should have been anticipated at the earlier time, or else possibly supported an appeal on some basis outside the existing ground of appeal. Whether or not these arguments are available, in my opinion there was nothing in the Crown address or the trial judge's summing up which supports them, and indeed, in my opinion the trial judge's summing up appropriately stressed that the ROI was not admitted against the appellant and appropriately dealt with any slight risk of prejudice that there may have been (cf Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31].) 

38For those reasons, in my opinion the ground of appeal is not made out and it is not necessary to consider the proviso. I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 

39HOEBEN J: I agree. 

40GROVE AJ: I also agree. 

41HODGSON JA: So the order of the Court is: appeal dismissed.

2757135,Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126,"Judgment 

1MACFARLAN JA : I agree with Johnson J. 

2JOHNSON J : The Appellant, Livai Raumakita, appeals against conviction with respect to an offence of armed robbery under s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900 . 

3The Appellant stood trial between 8 and 18 February 2010 at the Parramatta District Court before his Honour Judge Keleman SC and a jury on an indictment containing four counts. The charges were: 

(a) Count 1 - armed robbery on 13 August 2007 at Hunts Motel, Casula; 

(b) Count 2 - armed robbery on 28 August 2007 at the Moorebank TAB; 

(c) Count 3 - armed robbery on 1 September 2007 at the Canterbury Bowling Club; 

(d) Count 4 - during the course of the armed robbery on 1 September 2007 at the Canterbury Bowling Club, whilst in company with another person, assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

4The Appellant was convicted of the first and second counts and acquitted on the third and fourth counts. 

5On 23 April 2010, the Appellant was sentenced as follows: 

(a) Count 1 - non-parole period of five years commencing on 8 February 2012 and expiring on 7 February 2017, with a balance of term of four years commencing on 8 February 2017 and expiring on 7 February 2021; 

(b) Count 2 - non-parole period of five years and four months commencing on 8 February 2009 and expiring on 7 June 2014, with a balance of term of two years and eight months commencing on 8 June 2014 and expiring on 7 February 2017. 

6The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of eight years commencing on 8 February 2009 and expiring on 7 February 2017, with a balance of term of four years commencing on 8 February 2017 and expiring on 7 February 2021. 

7The Appellant seeks to appeal with respect to his conviction on the first count only. The single ground of appeal is as follows: 

""The verdict of guilty on count one of the indictment is unreasonable and unable to be supported, especially with regard to the acquittals on counts three and four of the indictment."" 

8There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. 

The Trial 

9At trial, there was no dispute that the robberies alleged in the first, second and third counts had occurred, nor that a member of staff of the Canterbury Bowling Club had been assaulted during the course of the third robbery (the fourth count). The defence case at trial was that the Appellant was not involved in any of the three robberies. The Appellant did not give evidence at the trial. 

The First Count - Armed Robbery at the Hunts Motel, Casula 

10The armed robbery in the first count was committed on 13 August 2007 when, at about 11.30 pm, three persons smashed through a glass sliding door at the entrance to the reception of Hunts Motel at Casula and entered the premises. The robbery was captured on CCTV footage. The three men wore balaclavas. One offender carried a red axe (which was visible on the CCTV footage). Another carried a knife and the third man had a hammer. The robbers threatened Mr Tony Lynes, the night manager, who was at the bar checking the float when the men smashed through the door. The robber with the knife said to Mr Lynes ""Open the safe or I'll cut your throat"" . Mr Lynes met the man with the knife between the bar and the entrance and a struggle ensued, before the robber put the knife to Mr Lynes' throat and said ""I'll cut your throat if you don't open it, open the safe"" . Mr Lynes struggled with the man and was then hit on the head, apparently by the robber holding the hammer. Mr Lynes passed out and, when he came to, he saw police at the front entrance door to the motel. 

11The evidence of Mr Lynes and the CCTV footage indicated that the robber carrying the red axe was wearing a light jacket and balaclava, with the other robbers wearing dark clothes and balaclavas. The Appellant's size and build were not inconsistent with the descriptions of the robbers observable on the CCTV footage and provided by Mr Lynes. 

The Second Count - Armed Robbery at Moorebank TAB 

12At about 10.45 am on 28 August 2007, two men smashed through the glass at the front door of the Moorebank TAB, which was located in premises within the Moorebank Hotel. One of the robbers used an axe to smash the glass. The robbery was captured on CCTV footage. One robber carried a red-coloured axe (visible in the CCTV footage) and the second robber carried a knife. Both offenders wore balaclavas. 

13Ms Barbara McGinnes was working alone at the Moorebank TAB on that day. The last customer left through a door to the hotel area after 10.45 pm. She went behind the counter to put the shutter down between the hotel and the TAB when she heard banging and the smashing of glass. She saw two people smashing the glass at the front door. She ran to the window between the hotel and the TAB, screaming for help and that somebody was breaking in. Having smashed through the glass at the front door, the two offenders ran in and smashed the glass on the counter. They jumped the counter and were screaming and yelling at Ms McGinnes to open the safe. A knife was held at her throat. After she told them that the safe was time locked and could not be opened, one of the robbers held a knife at her throat and said ""Open the safe, you fucking bitch, otherwise I'll kill you"" . The other robber was rummaging through the drawers behind the windows. 

14Mr Adam Cooper was working as the senior manager at the Moorebank Hotel on the evening of 28 August 2007. He heard Ms McGinnes screaming and ran through the common bar which connected to the TAB. He looked through a glass door and saw the two offenders. He described the men as quite tall compared to him (he was roughly 175 centimetres tall). He said they were dark in appearance with balaclavas, and their actual skin was dark as was their clothing. He could see the hands of one of the men and he described the skin colour of that man as dark brown. He said in evidence that he heard one of the robbers speak with an Islander accent, which he believed was from New Zealand, although he was not 100% sure of the country that the accent seemed to come from (AB317). 

15Detective Senior Constable Kneipp had spoken to the Appellant and described his accent as a ""very slight Islander accent"" which he explained as that of a ""Pacific or Torres Strait Islander which can encompass New Zealand, Tongan, Samoan"" (AB447). 

16Blood consistent with that of the Appellant was found on the smashed door at the Moorebank TAB. A backpack was worn by one of the offenders during this robbery. The backpack was retrieved after the third robbery and the Appellant's fingerprints were located on items found inside the backpack, those items having been stolen during the second robbery. In addition, DNA consistent with that of the Appellant was located on a disposable glove in the backpack. 

17It was the unchallenged evidence of Ms Vivien Beilby, a senior forensic biologist with the Division of Analytical Laboratories, that the DNA evidence from the front door glass, and the blood in the disposable glove contained in the backpack, matched that of the Appellant in that the DNA profile occurred in fewer than one in 10 billion individuals (AB273). 
 
The Third and Fourth Counts - Offences at Canterbury Bowling Club 

18The third robbery was committed by two men on 1 September 2007 when, at about 7.40 pm, they entered through the single front door of the Canterbury Bowling Club without breaking glass. One of the offenders attempted later to smash through the all-glass doors to exit the club after the robbery. 

19There was no CCTV footage of the third robbery. The description of events and the offenders was provided by the oral evidence of those present. Mr Phillip Tzavellas was a member of the Club, and was leaving the premises when he observed the robbers. Mr Jay Beddoes was a member of the Club who observed events whilst on the premises. Ms Rachel McKee was working as a bar attendant at the Club at the time of the robbery, and observed events in that context. 

20The witnesses observed that one robber carried a red tomahawk or axe and the other, a kitchen knife. 

21Both offenders were wearing balaclavas and one or both was wearing a hooded jumper. Mr Beddoes stated that both offenders were wearing black gloves. 

22Mr Tzavellas said there was ""a bit of a gap"" under the balaclavas and he thought that the man with the axe had a fair skin colour (AB338). Mr Beddoes said that one of the offenders said ""Where's the fucking safe?"" and ""Take me to Al or I'll fucking kill you"" . 

23According to Mr Beddoes, their accents sounded normal, but they were calling each other ""Mohammed"" (AB328). According to Ms McKee, both offenders seemed to have Middle-Eastern accents (AB371-372). Ms McKee heard one of them call the other ""Mohammed"" (AB375). 
 
Coincidence Evidence 

24At trial, the Crown relied upon coincidence evidence with aspects of the robbery in the second count said to be strikingly similar to those in the first count, and with aspects of the robbery in the second count being strikingly similar to those in the third count. The circumstances identified by the trial Judge during the summing up to the jury were that, in each of the robberies (AB44, AB53): 

(a) there was a sudden and violent entry into the premises that were robbed; 

(b) one of the offenders was carrying a small red axe; 

(c) one of the offenders was carrying a long bladed knife; 

(d) the offender carrying the knife held it against the throat of the person being robbed; 

(e) when the offender with the knife held a knife to the victim's throat, that offender threatened the victims that unless the safe was opened, the victim would be killed or have their throat cut; 

(f) all of the offenders wore balaclavas. 

25The Crown and trial defence counsel addressed the jury concerning other features of the offences as well. Defence counsel emphasised, amongst other things, the evidence of witnesses concerning the third and fourth counts that the robbers had Middle Eastern accents and called each other ""Mohammed"" . 
 
Submissions on Appeal 

26Mr Smith, counsel for the Appellant, submitted that the verdict of guilty on the first count was unreasonable. He submitted that the question was whether the verdict was reasonable on the whole of the evidence, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on the third and fourth counts. 

27Mr Smith submitted that it was possible to discern from the acquittals that the weight which the Crown sought to place on coincidence evidence had been, in a sense, diluted as the coincidence evidence said to exist with respect to the second and third counts had not led to a conviction on the third count: R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at 322 [135]. 

28Mr Smith developed the submission that the acquittals on the third and fourth counts served to reduce or dilute the weight that this Court should give to the coincidence evidence relied upon by the Crown with respect to the first count. He submitted that, as the Crown case on the first count was entirely dependent upon coincidence evidence arising from the second count, then an examination of the verdicts at trial, and the totality of the evidence, ought lead this Court to conclude that the verdict of guilty on the first count was unreasonable and ought be quashed. 

29The Crown submitted that there were clear points of distinction between the evidence with respect to the third and fourth counts, and that relevant to the first and second counts. It was submitted that there was a clear explanation for the different verdicts. Further, the Crown submitted that there were significant similarities between the first and second counts which served to fortify the conclusion of the jury that the Appellant was one of the robbers in each of the first and second crimes. 
 
Decision 

30As the sole ground of appeal against conviction does not involve a question of law alone, the Appellant requires leave to appeal against conviction: s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ; Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]. Having regard to the arguments advanced at the hearing, I would grant leave to appeal against conviction. 

31In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22]. 

32In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29]. 

33In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495: 

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above."" 

34The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13]. 

35Where an unreasonable verdict ground is said to be supported by a claim of inconsistent jury verdicts, the focus of the enquiry is upon any explanation for an acquittal, not for a conviction: R v TK at 321 [128]. 

36The Appellant bears the burden of establishing inconsistency of verdicts. This Court has said that it is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside: Dungay v R; R v Dungay [2010] NSWCCA 82 at [22]; Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [57]-[61]. 

37The written submissions for the Appellant asserted that this Court was required to give ""full weight"" to the acquittals on the third and fourth counts, citing Storey v The Queen [1978] HCA 39; 140 CLR 364. This assertion is of no real assistance to the Appellant. As Gleeson CJ and Hayne J observed in The Queen v Carroll [2002] HCA 55; 213 CLR 635 at 646 [31], seldom, if ever, ""can a verdict of acquittal be understood as some positive finding by the jury in favour of the accused about any of the issues that may have been contested at trial"" . 

38In my view, there is a readily available explanation in this case for the acquittals by the jury on the third and fourth counts. This explanation was stated succinctly by the trial Judge in his remarks on sentence of 23 April 2010 (pages 6-7): 

""The jury were clearly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the combination of circumstances present in the armed robbery committed at the TAB were so strikingly similar to the armed robbery committed at the Hunts Motel, the subject of count 1, that the offender must have been one of the three persons who committed the armed robbery at the Hunts Motel. However, on the evidence adduced in the trial, I am also unable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt which of the three persons who committed that armed robbery was the offender. 

In relation to count 3 there was evidence that each of the two persons who committed that armed robbery had Middle Eastern accents and referred to each other as 'Mohammed'. The offender does not have a Middle Eastern accent and his name is not Mohammed. In this context it is relevant to note that the armed robbery, the subject of count 1, was committed by three persons. 

I am satisfied that the jury's verdict of not guilty in respect of count 3 is explicable on the basis that while they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was one of the three participants who committed the armed robbery the subject of count 1, and one of the two persons who committed the armed robbery the subject of count 2, the Crown could not exclude the reasonable possibility, based on the evidence that the offenders in the armed robbery the subject of count 3 had Middle Eastern accents and called each other 'Mohammed', that the offender was not one of the two persons who committed the armed robbery at the Canterbury Bowling Club."" 

39There was a very strong Crown case against the Appellant on the second count. The totality of the evidence bearing upon that count, including the DNA and fingerprint evidence, established clearly that the Appellant was one of the two robbers involved in the offence committed at the Moorebank TAB on 28 August 2007. 

40In addition to the particular features of the offences relied upon by the Crown as coincidence evidence (see [24] above), there were other matters which provided cogent support for a conclusion that the Appellant was criminally involved in the robberies which comprised both the first and second counts. The jury had CCTV footage (and still photographs taken from that footage) with respect to both the first and second counts. This was additional important evidence which gave the jury a contemporaneous visual record of parts of these two robberies. There was no such evidence available with respect to the third count. 

41There was evidence with respect to the second count that one of the offenders spoke with an Islander accent, a feature not far removed from the voice of the Appellant. By way of contrast, the evidence of the witnesses concerning the third and fourth counts referred to Middle Eastern accents, with the two offenders referring to each other as ""Mohammed"" . At least one of the two offenders in the third count was said to have fair skin. 

42Having had an opportunity to consider the still photographs taken from the CCTV footage concerning the first and second counts (which were exhibits at trial), it is easy to see how this evidence could have been of considerable assistance to the jury (as it is to this Court) in a direct comparison of features of the offenders, including the axe, as being the same persons and things. This evidence was damaging to the Appellant. 

43Counsel on appeal did not submit that this Court should view the CCTV footage concerning the first and second counts for the purpose of discharging the Court's function under s.6(1): SKA v The Queen at 578 [30]-[31], 591-592 [116]. 

44In my view, the acquittal of the Appellant on the third and fourth counts is entirely explicable. It provides no assistance to the Appellant in support of his unreasonable verdict ground. It is apparent that the jury understood and applied the directions requiring separate consideration to be given to each count, and the direction concerning the requirement for proof beyond reasonable doubt and the associated direction that the jury did not have to be satisfied that the Appellant was innocent before it could find him not guilty on any count (AB59). Orthodox directions were given to the jury, and applied by the jury in reaching verdicts. 

45Having undertaken an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality, I am satisfied that the Applicant was guilty of the offence charged in the first count. The evidence was such that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. It has not been demonstrated that the verdict on the first count was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 

46In my view, the sole ground of appeal against conviction fails. 

An Admission Made by the Appellant After Conviction 

47The conclusion reached with respect to the appeal against conviction leaves it unnecessary to determine a further issue which was raised at the hearing of the appeal. However, as the issue was argued, it is useful to record the controversy, and some factors which may bear upon its resolution, in case a situation such as this occurs in another case. 

48After conviction, the Appellant's legal representatives arranged for him to be examined by Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, for the purpose of the preparation of a report on sentence. Dr Furst interviewed the Appellant at the Parklea Correctional Centre on 12 March 2010. In the course of the interview, Dr Furst asked the Appellant about the offences of which he was convicted. Dr Furst's report dated 16 April 2010 records the following with respect to the first count: 

""I asked Mr Raumakita about the offences he was recently convicted of. He said that on 13/08/07 he had used both 'ice' (about $50 worth) and cannabis (about 1 gram) prior to the offence. He said that he participated in the robbery 'to get money to buy drugs...and because I needed money to get by.' He told me that he had entered Australia on a Tourist Visa and did not have permission to work or claim Centrelink benefits. He said that he had to rely on his family for financial support, which made him feel stressed and low in mood at times. He attributed his use of 'ice' to the stress he would feel at times."" 

49According to Dr Furst, a separate admission was made by the Appellant concerning the second count. 

50Dr Furst's report was tendered by the Appellant's counsel on sentence in the District Court and was referred to in the remarks on sentence of the sentencing Judge (at pages 8-13). The Appellant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 

51The Crown sought to read an affidavit of Dr Furst sworn 17 May 2011 before this Court, relying upon s.12(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . The affidavit annexed the report dated 16 April 2010 and confirmed that the Appellant had given him the account of the offence of 13 August 2007 as set out above. Objection was taken to the affidavit on the ground of relevance. 

52The Crown submitted that this Court should have regard to the alleged admission by the Appellant in the event that the Appellant succeeded in his unreasonable verdict ground, with the evidence bearing upon one or other of the following issues: 

(a) the application of the proviso under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 , with the Court concluding that, taking into account the alleged admission, no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred so that the appeal ought be dismissed, or 

(b) in determining to order a new trial under s.8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 , rather than direct the acquittal of the Appellant under s.6(2) of that Act. 

53The Court was taken to a number of decisions where it was said that, after conviction by a jury, an appellant had confessed his guilt (in one way or another) prior to the hearing of an appeal against conviction: R v De-Cressac (1985) 1 NSWLR 381; R v Reid (NSWCCA, 13 September 1993, unreported); R v McCarthy and Ryan (1993) 71 A Crim R 395; R v Gudgeon (1995) 83 A Crim R 228; R v Bikic [2001] NSWCCA 537 and Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358. 

54If the point has been reached at the hearing of the present appeal, it would have been necessary to determine whether a post-conviction admission made prior to appeal may be taken into account by this Court in applying the s.6(1) proviso, so as to dismiss the appeal despite relevant error having been demonstrated at trial. The decision of this Court in R v De-Cressac would suggest, at the very least, that this Court would approach such a submission with considerable caution. This may be especially so if there was said to be a contest as to whether the admission was made. Here, it would seem that any contest would lie in the truthfulness of the admission, rather than the fact that it was made. 

55Consideration of the s.6(1) proviso directs attention to the evidence that was before the jury at trial: Cesan v The Queen at 393-395 [123]-[129]. 

56The following statements of Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ (Heydon J agreeing) in Cesan v The Queen at 395-396 [131] would also stand in the way of the Crown submission concerning the use of the proviso: 

""Finally, some weight was given by the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal to a letter written by Mr Cesan to the trial judge after the jury had returned a guilty verdict and before sentence was passed. The majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that, in the letter, he admitted his guilt of the offence charged. The letter was written for the evident purpose of mitigating the sentence that was then to be passed upon Mr Cesan. To do other than accept the jury's verdict would have aggravated the sentence. No weight can be attached to what was said in the letter in deciding whether there was no substantial miscarriage of justice."" 

57Before this Court, the Crown submitted respectfully (but with some justification) that the statement that to ""do other than accept the jury's verdict would have aggravated the sentence"" did not appear to conform with the principle that an accused person who contests the trial, whilst not entitled to mitigation for a plea of guilty, may not be penalised for the manner in which the defence was conducted: Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656 at 666-667 [30]-[34]. 

58If this Court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred following conviction on indictment and the conviction is to be quashed, the Court may order a new trial where, having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial: s.6(2); s.8(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

59Section 8(1) provides for the Court to have regard to ""all the circumstances"" , a phrase of considerable breadth. In The Queen v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at 254 [49], Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ observed that one of the key ""circumstances"" referred to in s.8(1), and one of the key factors in assessing whether a new trial is an adequate remedy, is the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of offenders. Their Honours observed, at 255 [51], in the context of that case, that an order for acquittal conflicted with the desirability of having the guilt or innocence of the accused person finally determined by a jury . 

60However, a little later, their Honours referred, at 256 [52], to the undesirability of the prosecution having an opportunity to present a new case at a retrial where the evidence had been insufficient at the first trial. 

61In an appropriate case, it may be considered relevant that the common law principle of finality of a jury verdict of acquittal has been altered to some extent by statute in this State in recent years. Section 107 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 now permits the Crown to appeal from a directed acquittal on a ground that involves a question of law alone: R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272; 175 A Crim R 108; R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; 261 ALR 265. 

62Further, Division 2 of Part 8 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (ss.99-106) permits the Crown, in an appropriate case, to apply to this Court for an order for retrial of a person following acquittal for an offence punishable by life imprisonment (which, of course, is not this case). Although these provisions have not been utilised as yet in this State, equivalent provisions have been applied in the United Kingdom, including cases where a post-acquittal admission is said to have been made: R v D [2006] EWCA Crim 1354; R v Miell [2007] EWCA Crim 3130; Hamer, ""The Expectation of Incorrect Acquittals and the 'New and Compelling Evidence' Exception to Double Jeopardy"" [2009] Crim LR 63 at 72-73. 

63In these ways, the law has changed in its approach to the finality of a verdict of acquittal following criminal trial by jury. What relevance (if any) such considerations may have to the application of ss.6(1), 6(2) and 8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 will be for this Court to consider in another case on a future day. 

64As it happens, it is not necessary for this Court to consider these questions in the context of the present appeal. The Appellant has not cleared the first hurdle, in that he has not demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice occurred at trial. He has not demonstrated that the verdict on the first count was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 

Orders 

65I propose the following orders: 

(a) leave to appeal against conviction granted under s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ; 

(b) appeal dismissed. 

66GARLING J : I agree with Johnson J.

2757151,R v Hoang Huy Nguyen R v Minh Duc Luong [2011] NSWSC 562,"Judgment  1Hoang Huy Nguyen and Minh Duc Luong each stand to be sentenced for the murder of Phuc Uy Nguyen and the murder of Brian Bao Dung Huynh. Hoang Huy Nguyen was found guilty of those two offences on 24 November 2010 after a trial by jury over which I presided. Minh Duc Luong pleaded guilty to the same two offences on the day on which the trial was due to commence, 27 October 2010.  2Hoang Huy Nguyen was tried together with another offender, Jian Jin, who was found guilty by the jury of four offences of being an accessory after the fact to the murders.  Jian Jin was sentenced separately by me on 16 March 2011: see R v Jin [2011] NSWSC 169. The sentence hearing in respect of the two offenders now before the court was unable to proceed on that day and has subsequently suffered further delay through no fault on the part of the offenders due to the unavailability of reports relevant to the sentencing decision.  3The maximum sentence for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life: section 19A of the Crimes Act 1900. The Crown expressly did not contend that the level of culpability of the offenders fell within the terms of section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 so as to attract mandatory life sentences under that section. I do not think that life sentences are warranted. The Crown submitted, however, that since each offender is to be sentenced for two murders, the court should impose very significant terms of imprisonment.  4Pursuant to section 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , a standard non-parole period of twenty years' imprisonment is prescribed for the offence of murder. The Crown submitted that these offences fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for that offence and that the standard non-parole period ""applies"". The consideration of that submission must of course comprehend the proper sentencing procedure for offences that carry a standard non-parole period discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) NSWLR 168 at [117] to [121] and the principles stated in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [31] to [32] and [37] to [39] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; and see the judgment of McHugh J especially at [50] to [56] .  5The proper approach requires the court, in determining the appropriate sentence, to consider whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. To that end, it is necessary to consider the facts relating directly to the commission of the offence in order to determine whether it falls within the middle of the putative range. However, even for offences that do, the court must be astute to avoid an approach that adopts the standard non-parole period as a starting point and allows it to dominate the remainder of the exercise: Way at [131] and [151] to [153]. The task is to weigh all the relevant factors and make a judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence. In the proceedings against Minh Duc Luong, the Crown acknowledged that the pleas of guilty themselves constitute sufficient reason to depart from the standard non-parole period.  6The submissions on sentence in the present case brought forward a number of factual disputes as to the proper basis on which Hoang Huy Nguyen should be sentenced. The principles as to the onus and standard of proof in respect of such matters are well known: see R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [24] to [27].  7With those principles in mind, I turn first to consider the facts relating directly to the commission of the two murders. Phuc Uy Nguyen and Brian Bao Dung Huynh both died after being stabbed in the heart during an altercation outside a bar in Bankstown on the evening of 1 February 2009.  The Crown case was that the two victims were set upon by four men including the two offenders before the court. The other two men, known in these proceedings only as ""Tommy"" and ""Zeng"", appear to have left the country. They have not been brought before the courts.  8Each of the victims suffered a number of stab wounds. The Crown acknowledges that the evidence did not reveal who of the four offenders inflicted the fatal wound in either case. In those circumstances, the prosecution case was conducted on the basis of a common purpose shared by the four offenders to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on each of the two victims.  9The offences must be considered in the context of an incident that occurred about two hours earlier when Hoang Huy Nguyen was dining at a Vietnamese restaurant called the My Canh.  As he was leaving the restaurant, he was confronted by Phuc Uy Nguyen (one of the men later killed) and a number of Phuc's friends, who had also been dining in the restaurant.  Phuc Uy Nguyen evidently believed that he recognised Hoang Huy Nguyen as a person who had been involved in a fight in Chinatown on New Year's Eve. There was no cogent evidence as to whether Hoang Huy Nguyen had in fact been involved in any such fight and I am not satisfied that he was.  10Hoang Huy Nguyen told the group that they were mistaken but it appears they did not believe him. I am satisfied that at some point during the altercation that followed, Hoang Huy Nguyen was struck or punched in the head.  His girlfriend was also evidently assaulted at some point. Hoang Huy Nguyen ran away from the restaurant in fear and was chased down the road at speed by at least four men, including Phuc Uy Nguyen.  A member of that group who gave evidence at the trial acknowledged that the object of the chase was to catch Hoang Huy Nguyen and give him ""a bashing"".   There was also evidence that one of the men was carrying a baton.  CCTV footage recovered by police revealed that it was an earnest chase.  I accept that it must have been quite terrifying to Hoang Huy Nguyen.  11There is a factual contest as to what happened next.  Although the Crown put the case to the jury on the basis that the agreement to attack the two victims may have been reached spontaneously just before they were stabbed, the primary Crown case was that greater planning was involved. The Crown's contention was that, after escaping from the group at the My Canh restauarant, Hoang Huy Nguyen spent the next couple of hours mustering a group of his own and arming them with knives to carry out a reprisal attack on Phuc Uy Nguyen.  12It is not in dispute that Hoang Huy Nguyen made a number of telephone calls to the co-offender, Jian Jin and another friend of theirs, Gary Xu.  Mr Xu was a critical witness in the Crown case as to the events leading up to the murders and their aftermath.  13I should note that, in sentencing Mr Jin, I said that I had assessed Mr Xu to be a careful and honest witness. However those remarks were made in the context that Mr Jin was charged only as an accessory after the fact. Accordingly, Mr Xu's evidence as to events leading up to the stabbings did not form any part of the factual basis on which Mr Jin was sentenced. The submissions on sentence on behalf of the present offenders launched a substantial attack on the reliability of that evidence. I have accordingly undertaken a further close review of the whole of Mr Xu's evidence in assessing those submissions, taking into account the dangers of relying on his evidence as to which I warned the jury.   14Mr Xu's evidence was that, on the afternoon of 1 February 2009, he received a call from Hoang Huy Nguyen who said that he had ""been fought"" by somebody and was not able to go home if no one would come and pick him up.  Mr Xu drove to Bankstown where he met Hoang Huy Nguyen in a parking space in the street.  Hoang Huy Nguyen asked Mr Xu to go and park in the multiple level car park, which he did.  He then walked back to Hoang Huy Nguyen, who asked him whether he had a knife in his car.  He said that he didn't.  Hoang Huy Nguyen then sent Mr Xu to meet two other men, Tommy and Duc, in front of a restaurant.  Mr Xu went and waited for them but could not find them.  He called Hoang Huy Nguyen to find out where they were.  Hoang Huy Nguyen said that he had already found them and told Mr Xu to come back.  15When Mr Xu went back to meet Hoang Huy Nguyen again at the parking area in the street, he saw that Jian Jin had also arrived.  A number of men were gathered at the boot of Mr Jin's car, including Mr Jin, Hoang Huy Nguyen, the offender Minh Duc Luong, Tommy, Zeng and another person not known to Mr Xu.   Mr Xu said that the boot of Mr Jin's car was open and that he saw two Kiwi brand knives in there.  He said that Hoang Huy Nguyen told him that he had bought the knives.  16Mr Xu said that, while the men were gathered at the boot, two security guards with dogs walked around from the park. The arrival of the two guards prompted Hoang Huy Nguyen to ask the group to move to the multi level car park, which they did.  The two guards gave evidence in the trial. Nothing in their evidence caused me to doubt the veracity of Mr Xu's account.  17After they got to the car park, Hoang Huy Nguyen left for a short time with Jian Jin, Minh Duc Luong, Tommy and Zeng.  When they returned, Hoang Huy Nguyen asked Mr Xu to take Tommy and Zeng to have something to eat and then to send them home.  Mr Xu took them back to Jian Jin's flat. Separately, mobile telephone records established that Hoang Huy Nguyen also left Bankstown for a period of time, travelling to the Canley Vale area with Jian Jin. I do not accept that those records disprove the version of events given by Mr Xu, although his estimates as to some of the times at which various events occurred appear to be wrong.  18Mr Xu later received a further call from Hoang Huy Nguyen asking him to take Tommy and Zeng back to Bankstown, which he did.  At the request of Hoang Huy Nguyen, he parked his car there and gave the keys to Hoang Huy Nguyen.  He then left in Jian Jin's car with Jian Jin.  He saw Hoang Huy Nguyen walking away with Minh Duc Luong, Tommy and Zeng.  19Mr Xu's evidence was vigorously tested at the trial.  I did not doubt its veracity then and nothing that has been put on behalf of Hoang Huy Nguyen has persuaded me that I should not accept it now. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Hoang Huy Nguyen was present at Bankstown during the period of time when the security guards had the group under observation at the boot of Jian Jin's car.  I am further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Hoang Huy Nguyen was planning during that period to return to confront Phuc Uy Nguyen with the backing of a group of armed men and to reprise the conflict opened by Phuc at the My Canh restaurant. I am satisfied that Hoang Huy Nguyen bought the two Kiwi brand knives seen by Mr Xu in the boot of the car to that end.  20As to the attack itself, I am satisfied on the strength of other evidence in the trial as to the following facts.  One of the four offenders (not Hoang Huy Nguyen) went into the hotel and invited Phuc Uy Nguyen outside.  The other victim, Brian Bao Dung Huynh, followed shortly behind him.  I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, once outside, Phuc Uy Nguyen punched Hoang Huy Nguyen.  I am not satisfied, however, that Hoang Huy Nguyen fell to the ground as contended on his behalf.  There was no evidence to support such a finding from the only eyewitnesses to any part of those events, Thy Nguyen and The Hung Nguyen.  21Although the evidence as to precisely what happened next is scant, it is clear that Brian Bao Dung Huynh was stabbed almost immediately and pushed back into the hotel, where he collapsed and died.  22Meanwhile, the fight with Phuc Uy Nguyen moved to a point around the corner from the entrance to the hotel. Senior counsel for Hoang Huy Nguyen invited me to find that the group that continued around the corner did not include Hoang Huy Nguyen, whom he contended had been struck to the ground. I am not persuaded as to that version of events. To my observation, the CCTV footage and stills tendered by the Crown clearly show all four offenders physically participating in the attack around the corner from the hotel and then running away together.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Hoang Huy Nguyen was on his feet and present at the point around the corner when Phuc Uy Nguyen was stabbed.  23The four offenders ran towards Bankstown station. Within a fairly short time after the stabbings, police recovered four knives, including two Kiwi brand knives, within close proximity to the hotel. DNA evidence at the trial established that two of the knives had the blood of both deceased on them, while a third, one of the Kiwi brand knives, had the blood of Phuc Uy Nguyen on the blade and non-blood DNA of Phuc Uy Nguyen on the handle.  24Shortly after the victims were stabbed, Mr Xu and Mr Jin received a call from Hoang Huy Nguyen asking them to pick him up at Bankstown Station.  However, they got lost on the way and eventually collected the four offenders at Yagoona station.  They then returned to Hoang Huy Nguyen's place.  25Mr Xu gave evidence as to the conversation that took place at that apartment. He said that Minh Duc Luong reported that a man (presumably Phuc Uy Nguyen) had punched Hoang Huy Nguyen in the face and that he (Minh Duc Luong) had then stabbed him in the back.  Tommy said that he had stabbed the second man who came to stop the fighting, presumably Brian Bao Dung Huynh.  26According to Mr Xu's account, Hoang Huy Nguyen then said that he had also stabbed someone.  Although there was a contest as to this issue at the trial, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Hoang Huy Nguyen also said to Mr Xu that the others had thrown their knives on the ground and that he (Hoang Huy Nguyen) had thrown his knife in the bin.  27Later, in a private conversation between Hoang Huy Nguyen and Mr Xu, Hoang Huy Nguyen said that he didn't actually stab anyone.  He asked Mr Xu whether police can find out that a knife is not the knife used to stab someone.  28I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Hoang Huy Nguyen was armed with one of the Kiwi brand knives from the boot of Jian Jin's car when he went to the hotel where the victims were stabbed.  I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew that the other three men in his group were carrying knives. In reaching that conclusion, I have taken into account the evidence of Mr Xu, which I accept, together with the forensic evidence as to the four knives recovered at the scene. In particular, the evidence was that the Kiwi brand knife which was found to have the blood of Phuc Uy Nguyen on the blade and non-blood DNA from Phuc Uy Nguyen on the handle was recovered from a garbage bin .  29It was submitted on behalf of Hoang Huy Nguyen that I should accept the possibility that the three offenders, Minh Duc Luong, Tommy and Zeng were armed by Mr Xu, or by a person or persons known to him and present at the time the group was observed by the security guards.  I do not accept that submission. It is contrary to the evidence of Mr Xu, which I accept.  30Mr Nicholson submitted that I could not exclude the reasonable possibility that the deceased Phuc Uy Nguyen was in possession of one of the knives found at the site, consistently with the forensic evidence that his DNA was found on the knife and was not blood sourced.  I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that one of the knives came from Phuc Uy Nguyen.  The preponderance of evidence points to the conclusion that the knives were collected and brought to the scene by Hoang Huy Nguyen and his associates.  Hoang Huy Nguyen made no suggestion when interviewed by police that Phuc had a knife.  31I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, however, that Hoang Huy Nguyen did not in fact stab either victim.  In reaching that conclusion, I have had regard to the evidence of Mr Xu as to his conversations with Hoang Huy Nguyen after the event.  It seems likely that, after boasting in the presence of Minh Duc Luong, Tommy and Zeng, Hoang Huy Nguyen told Mr Xu the truth when he later said, privately, that he had not in fact stabbed anyone. It is an agreed fact that Minh Duc Luong stabbed both of the deceased and that is consistent with the DNA evidence. Another knife also had the blood of both deceased on it. It seems likely that the victims were both stabbed by both Minh Duc Luong and either Tommy or Zeng.  32In light of my finding that Hoang Huy Nguyen did not in fact stab either victim and the subjective evidence concerning Hoang Huy Nguyen's background, to which I will return, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was party to an agreement to kill either of the victims. Separately, in considering his culpability, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, when planning the offences, the clarity of his thinking was to some degree adversely affected by the fear he had experienced earlier in the evening. I suspect that the dangerous confrontation he set in train quickly went beyond what he set out to achieve.  33As to Minh Duc Luong, although he admits stabbing both victims, there is otherwise so little evidence before the court on sentence as to his involvement in the offences that I am left with a doubt as to his state of mind. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it is appropriate to sentence both offenders on the basis of a common purpose to inflict grievous bodily harm on each of the two victims. I accept the submission on behalf of the Crown that the offences fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offence of murder. Although I have made different findings as to their involvement in the offences, in the end I do not think that there is any difference between the moral culpability of the two offenders.  34In determining the appropriate sentences for the present offences, I must specifically take into account any relevant aggravating or mitigating factors referred to in section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  35I have already recorded my reasons for finding that the offences involved a degree of planning on the part of Hoang Huy Nguyen.  In the proceedings against him, the Crown relied upon the following additional aggravating factors.  First, the offences involved the use of weapons.  I regard that as a factor of little significance in the case of murder, which in my view could be equally awful when committed without a weapon.  36Secondly, the Crown submitted that the offences were committed without regard for public safety.  The attack upon the two victims commenced in the public entrance to the hotel and almost immediately spilled onto the footpath of a public street.  One of the eyewitnesses who gave evidence at the trial was a woman who was having a drink with a friend. Brian Bao Dung Huynh collapsed on the floor and died near where she was sitting. I do not have any difficulty concluding that the violent fight that resulted in these offences displayed disregard for the safety of members of the public present in and around the hotel.  37So far as mitigating factors are concerned, I have already indicated that I accept Hoang Huy Nguyen's plan was precipitated by the fear he experienced during the aggression shown to him earlier in the evening. I do not think that greatly reduces his culpability but it is a relevant factor.  38I accept, as submitted on behalf of Hoang Huy Nguyen, that he should be sentenced as a person of prior good character.  He has two prior convictions for drink driving offences but I do not regard those as matters of any significance in the present context.  39Mr Nicholson submitted that the court should find that Hoang Huy Nguyen is unlikely to reoffend and has good prospects of rehabilitation.  I have given careful consideration to that question.  A matter of considerable concern is that, to this day, Hoang Huy Nguyen maintains his innocence.  It is often thought that acceptance of responsibility for an offence is a first and necessary step on the path to rehabilitation.  40Mr Nicholson tendered a report prepared in relation to Hoang Huy Nguyen  by Mr Sam Borenstein, Clinical Psychologist. Hoang Huy Nguyen told Mr Borenstein, as to the confrontation outside the My Canh Restaurant, that he was ""caught up in events where he believed he was mistaken for his co-accused"" and that he ""sought to clarify matters with the victim"". The version of events Hoang Huy Nguyen told Mr Borenstein was that he went to the hotel and made contact with one of the men who assaulted him.  He invited the man outside, who then punched him and in immediate retaliation his friends ""knifed the two victims to death"".  41At the conclusion of the report, Mr Borenstein states ""he expressed what I deemed to be genuine guilt and remorse with regards the death of two persons, and denies direct responsibility"". I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Hoang Huy Nguyen does have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, notwithstanding his persistence in maintaining that he is not directly responsible for the offences. The report of Mr Borenstein records a comfortable upbringing involving good education and close family relationships. He has no prior history of antisocial traits or psychiatric disturbance.  42Other material tendered at the proceedings on sentence discloses that Hoang Huy Nguyen has undertaken a number of training courses since his arrest and is employed in the prison. He has a favourable reference from the prison chaplain.  43An additional factor to be taken into account is the period Hoang Huy Nguyen will spend in custody by dint of the lengthy sentences that must be imposed.  It seems likely that many years of reflection and the ordinary process of maturing will be conducive to rehabilitation.  On balance, I am satisfied that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.  44The Crown acknowledged that the hearing was shortened as a result of concessions made by Hoang Huy Nguyen at his trial which reduced the number of witnesses required to give evidence in the trial and enabled a deal of technical evidence to be adduced in short-hand fashion. That is a factor which, whilst not demonstrating contrition or falling strictly within the wording of section 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , shows a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and is appropriately taken into account for the purpose of sentencing: see R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119 at [58].  45As to the offender Minh Duc Luong, I take into account the fact that he pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial. I propose to discount his sentence by about 10% to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas in accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 at [160](iii) per Spigelman CJ. I am also aware that Minh Duc Luong made admissions to police upon his arrest. Although the ERISP was not tendered in the proceedings on sentence, I suspect that was due to oversight. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to take those admissions into account in his favour as indicating some acceptance of responsibility for the offences.  46I also take into account the fact that Minh Duc Luong was only 18 at the time of the offences. That is a significant factor in assessing his culpability for the offences. It is common wisdom that men of that age are still maturing and are less able to exercise good judgment than some older men. I was invited to infer that Minh Duc Luong committed the offences at the behest of another but I do not think the evidence supports such a finding, and I am not sure that it would be a mitigating factor in any event.  47I also take into account the fact that Minh Duc Luong has no prior convictions. As to his prospects of rehabilitation, a report was tendered on his behalf by a psychologist, Anna Robilliard, but unfortunately he did not return for the second part of the assessment as scheduled. Regrettably, the result is that the report does little more than to record matters of family background. I have found it of little assistance except on the issue of the added hardship that Minh Duc Luong will probably encounter by reason of his Vietnamese heritage and the fact that he will be serving his term of imprisonment in an English speaking country with little support from family and friends. Hoang Huy Nguyen will, perhaps to a lesser extent, suffer similar hardship.  48Finally, it is necessary to consider questions of concurrency and accumulation and the principle of totality. It was submitted on behalf of the offenders that the fact that the offences were all constituted by the same course of conduct would point in favour of there being significant concurrency of the individual sentences. The Crown acknowledged that a degree of concurrency was appropriate but maintained that there should be some accumulation to take due account of the fact that two lives were taken.  49In determining the degree of accumulation, I have had regard to the fact that the severity of a sentence is not in linear proportion to its length. Although the offences are extremely serious, and warrant lengthy terms of imprisonment, the court should not impose sentences that in aggregate will be crushing. Nonetheless, there must be some accumulation to reflect separate punishment for each murder. In the case of Hoang Huy Nguyen, I propose to accumulate the sentences by four and a half years. In the case of Minh Duc Luong, I propose to accumulate the sentences by four years.  50The fact that there is to be some accumulation in the sentences is a circumstance that warrants some departure from the requirement under section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that ordinarily the balance of term should not exceed one third of the non-parole period. The effect of the adjustment I propose will be that the aggregate sentences will reflect the statutory ratio. Otherwise, I do not think there is any warrant for reducing the non-parole periods so as to provide for an extended term on parole. The period of supervision that will be allowed by the sentences that must be imposed will be adequate for that purpose.  51I propose to set non-parole periods that are shorter than the standard non-parole period. As to Hoang Huy Nguyen, my reasons for reducing the period are my findings as to the fearful state of mind in which he planned the offences, his prospects of rehabilitation, the impact of accumulation of the two sentences and the hardship of serving a sentence in an English speaking country. As to Minh Duc Luong, my reasons for reducing the period are his pleas of guilty, his youth, the impact of accumulation of the two sentences and the hardship of serving a sentence in an English speaking country.  52The effect of the sentences I am about to impose is that Hoang Huy Nguyen will spend a total of twenty-two and a half years in prison without parole. The total term of his sentences will be thirty years.  53Minh Duc Luong will spend a total of twenty-one years in prison without parole. The total term of his sentences will be twenty-eight years.  54Hoang Huy Nguyen, please stand.  55For the murder of Brian Bao Dung Huynh, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non parole period of eighteen years commencing on 13 October 2009 and expiring on 12 October 2027 and a balance of term of seven and a half years expiring on 12 April 2035.  56For the murder of Phuc Uy Nguyen, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non parole period of eighteen years commencing on 13 April 2014 and expiring on 12 April 2032 and a balance of term of seven and a half years expiring on 12 October 2039. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole is 12 April 2032.  57Minh Duc Luong, please stand.  58For the murder of Brian Bao Dung Huynh , I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non parole period of seventeen years commencing on 13 October 2009 and expiring on 12 October 2026 and a balance of term of seven years expiring on 12 October 2033.  59For the murder of Phuc Uy Nguyen, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non parole period of seventeen years commencing on 13 October 2013 and expiring on 12 October 2030 and a balance of term of seven years expiring on 12 October 2037. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole is 12 October 2030.  **********

2757156,Joshua Maher v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 97,"Judgment 

1MCCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove AJ. 

2DAVIES J: I agree with Grove AJ. 

3GROVE AJ: Following trial before Hughes DCJ and a jury at Parramatta District Court the appellant was convicted of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Rhyse Hooker. He had been acquitted (by direction) of a second count in the indictment which was in similar terms nominating Daniel Cohen as the victim. He was jointly tried with one John Donald in respect of whom the outcomes were the same on identical counts. 

4The offence has a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. After conviction on 12 February 2010 the appellant was released on continuing bail. On 20 August 2010 he was sentenced to imprisonment for one year suspended upon conditions as to good behaviour, residence and supervision by the Probation and Parole service. It was not suggested that anything has happened for which the appellant might be called up for breach of conditions. No Crown appeal against that sentence was instituted. 

5The appellant challenges his conviction on the ground that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. Such a ground requires this Court to determine whether, upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. It is recognised that a measure of restraint is obligatory when considering the serious step of setting aside a verdict found by a jury whose verdict must be accorded special respect and legitimacy: MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606. These strictures are borne in mind and applied when reaching a conclusion in this appeal. 

6As will appear, the evidence as it emerged, was, to say the least, somewhat confused and more so than what might be expected in common cases which require resolution of contradictions between witnesses. 

7The nominated victim, Rhyse Hooker lived in a house numbered 60 in a street in St Marys. He testified that he had been at the house numbered 36 in the afternoon of Friday 14 November 2008 but returned home for dinner at about 9 pm. At about 2.15 am on Saturday 15 November he returned to number 36 and commenced to watch a movie. At the time he was in company with Daniel Cohen and a young female whom I shall refer to as KT. She was aged 15 when she gave evidence in the trial in February 2010. Rhyse Hooker was also aware that another girl of similar age (TP) had gone to sleep in a bedroom at number 36. 

8Mr Hooker's evidence was that, shortly after they began watching the movie, he heard a screen door and then a front door open and six persons entered the room. He knew some of them. He described those who entered as ""Anthony Shipley, then two other dark people, then John Donald and Shannon and Adrian"". He described being attacked by John Donald and Anthony Shipley and thereafter he told of his eventual retreat into the kitchen where he used his feet to barricade the door in order to prevent assailants from reaching him. A number of items were thrown in his direction which he was able to observe when he opened and closed the kitchen door. He described some events concerning Daniel Cohen who, it appears, was unable to be located at the time of trial. It was during this incident at about 2.15 am that it was alleged Rhyse Hooker sustained actual bodily harm. 

9The intruders departed, a final occurrence being the breakage of a window by throwing a chair through it. It was the appellant's case that he was not one of those who had entered the house at number 36 at about 2.15 am. Mr Hooker did not identity him as one of them. As a matter of fact the appellant could not fulfil any description of being one of ""other dark people"". 

10Counsel for the then co-accused elicited from Mr Hooker evidence that he had ""on monday"" nominated the appellant as one of the intruders. ""Monday"" was a reference to a trial which commenced and was aborted. Mr Hooker said that he had realised that it was a mistake to identify the appellant and he pointed out that there were factors affecting his ability to recall and he mentioned that he suffered from epilepsy and some psychiatric problems. 

11Cross examined by Counsel for the appellant, Mr Hooker agreed that in a statement to police on 15 November 2008 he did not nominate the appellant as one of the intruders who attacked him. 

12In re-examination by the Crown Prosecutor Mr Hooker confirmed that the evidence given on ""monday"" concerning the appellant was ""an honest mistake"". 

13The consequence must be that there is simply nothing in the testimony of Mr Hooker which could inculpate the appellant in the offence charged. 

14The next witness was KT who as above noted, was watching the movie in the early hours of the morning. I interpolate that an adult, TP's mother, ordinarily resided at number 36 but was staying elsewhere overnight on this occasion. 

15KT had met the appellant some time in 2008. She said that on ""that night"" she saw the appellant fighting with ""TP's sister's brother's friend"". This was a reference to an altercation between the appellant and a person known as Marbuck Dixon. This altercation was not contemporaneous with the events leading to the charge of occasioning actual bodily harm to Rhyse Hooker. 

16Despite from time to time moving from events earlier in the evening to those at about 2.15 am she gave the following evidence: 

""Q. What did he and the boys do? 
A. They were having a fight with Chantelle's brothers friend. 

Q. This also was something you mentioned to the police I think in the interview, wasn't it? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Was there any other time after that you saw Josh Maher? 
A. I'm not quire sure but I think he came back with them boys, when they started bashing Daniel and Chris. 

Q. What, if anything, do you remember of seeing Josh Maher on that occasion? 
A. I wasn't quite sure but I think I saw him there. 

Q. Exactly where, when and doing what? 
A. They were just standing with the boys. They were sort of standing around. 

Q. You said to the police I think that you saw the boys coming in through the door and then you described the things that happened including Daniel and Chris getting assaulted, correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Now, where and when in that sequence, if at all, did you see Josh Maher? 
A. I didn't because I wasn't - I didn't. 

Q. Where and when did you see him? 
A. When he was drinking and when he came back with some boys and they wanted to go fight Shane's friend. 

Q. I thought you indicated that you saw him, yet again, after that when he came back with the boys? 
A. No, I said I think I saw him. 

Q. You think you saw him? 
A. Yes. 

Q. That is what I want to ask you about. So this would be a fourth time, wouldn't it, if you saw him then? 
A. Yes. 

Q. The first time when you were first introduced to Josh Maher, the second time when he came with a few boys, I think you said four of them came to see the two girls and there was some drinking of whisky, right? 
A. Mm-hmm. 

Q. Then you told the police about five minutes later Josh Maher came back and that was out the front, right, and there was a possible fourth time where you think you saw him but you are not sure, is that the situation? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I want to ask you about that fourth time. Just tell me if you can what it was that you saw, as best you can recall it, if anything, of Josh Maher on that occasion? 
A. I saw this person who looked just like him but I don't know if it was him or not. He was a white person. 

Q. And where did you see that white person and what was he doing? 
A. He wasn't doing anything, he was just standing around with some other boys and yelling out and stuff. 

Q. Inside the house or outside the house or where? 
A. Inside. Like some of them were standing near the door, the front door, yes. 

Q. Inside the front door or outside the front door? 
A. They were inside but they were standing near the front door. 

Q. What were they doing nor saying, those boys? 
A. I can't remember, they were just all young. 

Q. As to the white person, that may have been Josh Maher but you are not sure, describe that person as you remember him on that night? 
A. I know he was just as tall as him and looked the same, yeah. I wasn't really looking at him. 

Q. So, did you say that person was as tall as Josh Maher? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And looks the same as Josh Maher does, is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you hear that person speak? 
A. No. 

Q. Are you able now to describe what that person was wearing? 
A. No. 

Q. Are you able to say whether or not he had a hat on? 
A. Yes, I think he did. 

Q. Are you or are you not prepared to swear that person was Josh Maher? 
A. What do you mean? 

Q. Swear means to say that it is your evidence that was him? 
A. Yes, I'm sure it was him, but. 

Q. I beg your pardon? 
A. I'm sure it was him. I'm sure it was him. 

Q. I'm sorry, but I thought you weren't sure? 
A. No. I'm not quite sure but I'm sure. I don't know. 

Q. Just in your own words express it? 
A. It looked like him because I wasn't really full looking at him but it looked like him. That's why I say it was him. 

Q. Have you got any doubts about it? 
A. No."" 

17In cross-examination KT agreed that she had made a statement to police on the morning of 15 November 2008. In that statement she agreed that she referred to a fight in which the appellant was involved and corrected the impression that this occurred at about 11 to 12 in daylight and said that it was ""like around midnight"". 

18This police interview was video recorded. With reference to the appellant and the incident at about 2.15 am she was asked directly ""was Josh"" (the appellant) ""one of the blokes that came back"" and she was seen to move her head from side to side. At trial her testimony was interrupted while Counsel argued about the interpretation of the movement of her head but ultimately and, if I may say obviously, she agreed that she was indicating ""no"". 

19The evidence of KT does not provide evidence which could be relied upon as identifying the appellant as one of the intruders. 

20The only direct evidence identifying the appellant as such came from TP. As I have observed, she was 15 years old when giving evidence in February 2010 and was therefore (like KT) about 13 or 14 at the time of the central occurrence. 

21Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted this was a ""rare case"" wherein the unsatisfactory demeanour of the witness TP can be discerned from the transcript. It will be necessary to quote substantial portions of her testimony. There is considerable force in this submission by Counsel. 

22The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Senior Constable Mirabito, testified that he had became aware that TP was at the premises on 15 November 2008 but in the ensuing 14 months had not been able to obtain a statement from her. Conscious of her age, he had sought to arrange contact through her mother but she had not co-operated. He did not obtain a statement from TP until the Friday before she gave evidence on 8 February 2010. 

23Her capacity to recall accurately the events of the evening, whether when making her statement or giving evidence, is, in any event doubtful. She was asleep when the intruders arrived and there was some controversy as to whether she woke or was awakened but it is significant, as appears in the extract of evidence given by KT above, that there had been ""some drinking of whisky"". 

24TP was asked: 

""Q. Okay, can I ask you before you went to bed had you been drinking with anybody? 
A. Nope. 

Q. Had you - you hadn't been drinking with some boys who were around drinking, drinking scotch and coke or something along those lines? Black Douglas? 

A. No. Oh, yes."" 

25This topic was again raised and further testimony emerged: 

""Q. You were watching TV weren't you and you got bored? 
A. Yeah and then, you know. 

Q. No, I don't know? 
A. Go to sleep. 

Q. Go to sleep - after midnight? 
A. Yes, something like that. 

Q. And I think before that, so before you went to sleep I know you told Mr Crown nothing happened, but before that you had been having some scotch and coke hadn't you? 
A. Yeah, yeah. 

CROWN: I object. The question is inaccurate. The witness didn't say nothing was happening. 

SANDILANDS: I withdraw that part Mr Crown. 

HIS HONOUR: I thought she did. 

SANDILANDS: I thought she did too. 

HIS HONOUR: In fact I am sure she did. Then she was reminded of the scotch, Black Douglas - I think it's an inferior scotch. 

WITNESS: Doo doo di doo doo, doop doop. 

HIS HONOUR: She was reminded of that and then she said, ""Yes I did."" 

WITNESS: Can I go now?"" 

26And again: 

""Q. No, that's not going to make things shorter. How much scotch had you drunk, how much scotch had you drunk that day, that night? 
A. I don't know, like 10 cups, probably 20. I don't know. 

Q. Are you just saying that or are you making that up as you go along? 
A. No. I don't know, like probably like five. 

Q. Probably about five? 
A. Yeah, probably or six. I don't know. 

Q. Or six? 
A. Maybe, yeah."" 

27TP went on to acknowledge that when she awoke that night she had ""a bit of a hangover"". 

28The testimony of TP (as transcribed) was littered with responses by her which strongly indicated that she was not attempting to give the Court the benefit of her best recollection. 

29It is recognised that in her initial evidence in chief she said she was woken by people fighting and she walked out (into the lounge) and ""it got broken up"". She said that she identified ""Josh, Anthony and yea I know all them, don't know the rest"". 

30""Josh"" is a reference to the appellant. TP said she saw her cousin (Daniel Cohen) being ""bashed"" and that one of the perpetrators was ""Daniel"". Asked to elaborate she said ""it was Joseph's brother Anthony - not Anthony. Fukin - sorry. Sorry Josh's brother"". She accepted, as led to her, that the Daniel she referred to was Daniel Maher. 

31A gauge to the atmosphere at this point can be derived from an intervention by his Honour: 

""Q. Miss, would you stop chewing gum, please? 
A. Sorry. 

Q. This is a court of law, it's not some kind of amusement arcade. Now, stop chewing gum and answer questions sensibly. 

A. It's gone. 

Q. Thank you. Don't be impertinent either."" 

32This can be gleaned by the foregoing; there was more than one visit by groups of ""boys"" to number 36 on the night in question. The indictment specifically related to the intrusion at about 2.15 am. At times TP appeared to be conflating different visits as appears in this extract from her evidence: 

""Q. So just in terms of the sequence you've indicated that when you came out of the bedroom, out of your bedroom where you were asleep? 
A. Yeah, yes. 

Q. You saw some boys walking out and you've also indicated that you saw some boys bashing your cousin, right? 
A. Yeah, yeah. 

Q. When was that in relation to the boys walking out? 
A. What do you mean by that? 

Q. Okay. 
A. I don't know, I was not there. 

Q. So just dealing then with your evidence that you've given so far that they were bashing your cousin, Daniel Cohen and he was, I think you said, did you say he was standing near the front door? 
A. No, he was sitting down and they came back in and then they couldn't get to Chris so they bashed my cousin. 

Q. I'm sorry and where was your cousin when they bashed him then? 
A. I think he was on the lounge. 

Q. Yeah? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. The boys came back in, did they? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Were they the same boys that had gone out a moment before? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Are you able to say whether or not all of them came back in or just some? 
A. Some, cause some boys went home. 

Q. How many boys were there at first when you saw them walking out? 
A. I wouldn't have a clue, probably about seven. I don't know, something like that. I wouldn't have a clue. 

Q. And then how many boys came back in when Daniel was on the lounge, the couch? 
A. Have a think about that one. I don't know. 

Q. You don't know how many came back in but they didn't all come back in is that the best you can do? 
A. No, yeah. Yeah, that's the best that I can do, mate. 

Q. Please continue then, what happened next? 
A. What happened next, they took it out the front, they had a go at - they went out the front and then, yeah. 

Q. They took it out the front, what do you mean by that? 
A. Yeah, like they had a fight out the front. 

Q. Who had a fight out the front? 
A. I don't know, my cousin. I don't want to do this."" 

33Shortly after this her evidence continued: 

""Q. Can you remember some of the details of what happened that night? 
A. No, not really."" 

34The Crown Prosecutor later returned to direct attention to acquaintance with the appellant. The examination of TP continued: 

""Q.Did you see any - did you see him again after that prior to the night you're talking about now, that's Josh Maher? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. How many times did you see him? 
A. They have to be hard questions, don't they? I don't really know. I don't want to do this. 

Q. Can you give an approximation as to how many times you saw him? 
A. Not really. Do I have to do this? 

Q. In between the time you were first introduced - 
A. Yeah. 

Q. And the night in question did you see him again once or more than once? 
A. More than once. 

Q. Just doing the best you can approximately how many more times did you see him in that period? 
A. No, I don't know. I need help. I don't know what to do. 

Q. Did you ever talk to him again in that period? 
A. Yeah. Yes, I have. 

Q. Now, on the night in question did you see any other people that you recognised from before? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Who were they? 
A. Anthony, Daniel, then yeah, no one. 

Q. Anthony, Daniel and yeah, what did you mean please? 
A. And this is stressful. I need a drink of water. Can I go now? Cheers."" 

35In her evidence TP vacillated about the presence, identity or activity of the intruders. For example: 

""Q. Did you know a man called, or a boy called David May? 
A. David May? 

Q. Yes. 
A. Nope. 

Q. Corey May? 
A. Corey May, oh yeah, I know him, yep. Yeah, man, but he wasn't there I think. Oh yeah, he was there. 

Q. When was Corey May there? 
A. I don't know, this was a long time ago, I wouldn't have a clue. 

Q. What was Josh Maher wearing on the night in question? 
A. I don't know, I wouldn't have a clue. 

Q. What part precisely did Josh Maher play when your cousin was being bashed on the lounge? What did you see him do in relation to that, if anything? 
A. don't know. I don't know."" 

36About this juncture the Crown Prosecutor obtained leave to cross-examine TP pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act . Parts of the statement made on the previous Friday were read to her and included was a description of: 

""...I saw about seven or eight boys hitting into Daniel, my cousin. I saw Anthony Shipley, Josh Maher, Offa (unknown surname), John Donald, Shannon (unknown surname) and a couple of boys I don't know all hitting Daniel"". 

37I pause to interpolate that the appellant is convicted of assaulting Rhyse Hooker and not of assaulting Daniel Cohen. 

38The statement was read to her in parts and TP's responses included ""Mm"", ""no"", ""oh no, not, no"" and ""listen, is Josh"". This last appears to be interrogatory in nature but is obviously incomplete. One is left to speculate as to what confirmation TP is seeking. 

39She did agree however, when it was led to her, that what was in her statement was true. 

40TP was next cross-examined by Counsel for the co-accused. He elicited some evidence of TP's consumption of liquor which has already been recited. When questioned about her omission to include Coorey May as one of those who intruded, she said that she just forgot about him, then she added that he was going to get locked up ""anyways"" and she further added that her memory was ""lost"". 

41She confirmed to Counsel that she has seen the appellant and Marbuck Dixon engaged in a flight earlier in the night after which she thought the appellant ""went back to his house"". 

42Cross-examination by Counsel for the appellant elicited these responses: 

""Q. Okay, can I suggest to you that you are mistaken about, first of all, seeing Josh Maher being one of the boys. What do you say about that? 
A. Huh? 

Q. You know what I mean when I say you made a mistake, don't you? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Yes, well I am saying to you that you made a mistake, you didn't see Josh Maher going out just after you got woken up, did you, think back? 
A. Mm-hmm. 

Q. This is really important, I know you are laughing? 
A. Think back, that's a long time ago. 

Q. If you can't be sure just say that to the court now? 
A. I can't be sure. 

Q. I am not putting words in your mouth, am I? 
A. Yes, no you're not. 

Q. So what you are saying is you really can't be sure whether you saw Josh Maher going out the door, is that right - think about it - are you drawing there, are you? 
A. No. 

Q. What are you doing? 
A. I got no pen. 

Q. Just listen to my question. I am saying that you can't be sure now that you actually saw Josh Maher going out the door when you came to the hallway, can you? 
A. Mm-hmm. I can't answer. 

Q. Either yes or no? 
A. Yes."" 

43These questions were after followed by enquiry concerning the consumption of alcohol which has been above quoted. The cross examiner returned to this topic again: 

""Q. And it's not true that Josh Maher wasn't even there in the early hours of the morning, was he? 
A. I don't know. No, but he was there. I know it. I forget. I don't remember. 

Q. How can you be so sure? 
A. So sure? 

Q. Yeah. 
A. Because I'd seen him right there. 

Q. But you'd been drinking? 
A. No - I'd been drinking? 

Q. Yeah. 
A. I wasn't drinking that much. 

Q. Weren't you? About five or six cups? 
A. Yeah, I was tipsy. 

Q. And what I'm saying to you is you think he was there but you're confusing it with another time? 
A. No, he was there. 

Q. Was he? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. You know Josh Maher's mum, Sharon, real well too don't you? 
A. Yep. 

Q. Yeah. Did you tell Sharon a couple of weeks ago that Josh was definitely not there on that morning? 
A. Not that morning but that night. 

Q. Sorry, that's what I meant, the early hours of the morning-- 
A. Yeah. 

Q. You told his mother that Josh was not there? 
A. Josh, he was there the first time but not that. He was there the first time not the second time. 

Q. Okay, so you're now saying he was there the first time but not the second time? 
A. Yeah, I said that before. 

Q. Okay, can you just explain to me what you mean by the first time and the second time? 
A. He was, he was there the first fight and then he wasn't there the second time, so."" 

44Thus this evidence can be understood to assert that TP saw the appellant at number 36 when he fought with Marbuck Dixon but not ""the second time"" which seems to be a reference to the intrusion at about 2.15 am. 

45There was no other witness testifying to the essential proposition in support of the indictment that the appellant was one of the intruders who came at 2.15 am. It would have been necessary for the jury to accept beyond reasonable doubt the evidence of TP when she said from time to time that the appellant was present at 2.15 am and was a participant in the attack upon Rhyse Hooker. 

46The foregoing substantial extracts of TP's evidence show contradictions, uncertainties and obvious unwillingness to apply herself to the seriousness of the task upon which she was engaged. In my view it would be dangerous to rely upon her testimony, in particular her identification of the appellant. 

47In coming to that conclusion it is not to be ignored that her memory of events was attempted to be provoked for the purpose of making a statement well over a year after the events and only days before she came to testify. The resource for her statement and her evidence was a memory of a very young person who had ingested strong liquor and at the time had wakened from a following sleep. 

48The assertion in the ground of appeal that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence should be sustained. 

49Having regard to that conclusion and the foregoing observations and recitations of extracts of evidence, inquiry might be provoked as to why the verdict of guilty was returned. It is not appropriate to speculate upon the determination of the jury nor upon their reasoning but it does not pass notice that the appellant himself gave evidence which involved an admission at the very outset that he had lied to police. His mother gave evidence supporting the proposition that he was in bed at home on the relevant night. A tribunal of fact may well have some difficulty in accepting this assertion bearing in mind the evidence of the fight earlier in the night between the appellant and Marbuck Dixon which, contrary to the appellant's proposition, was described by witnesses as occurring close to midnight rather than close to midday. In addition there was a contradiction between Mrs Maher and the officer in charge of police investigation about conveying to the latter the facts which constituted the claimed alibi. 

50Although these criticisms tend to provide an understanding as to why the defence case should be rejected, none of the matters rejected would repair the deficiency in the Crown case in positively identifying the appellant as one of the intruders. 

51I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and sentence and enter a verdict and judgment of acquittal on the remaining count on the indictment.

		10 June 2011",2011-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757162,Arora v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWSC 552,"Judgment 

1Each of the plaintiffs (Jagdish Arora and Gaurav Arora) seeks an order permanently staying the prosecution of a charge against him brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (""the CDPP"") under the Criminal Code (Cth) (""the Code""). Jagdish Arora is charged under s 400.4 of the Code; Gaurav Arora is charged under s 400.3(1) of the Code. Section 400 creates the offence commonly known as ""money laundering"". No challenge was made to the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application. 

2Section 400.3(1) is, relevantly, in the following terms: 

"" (1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money ... and 
(b) either: 
(i) the money ... is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or 
(ii) the person intends that the money ... will become an instrument of crime; and 
(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money ... is $1,000,000 or more. 
Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years..."" 

3Section 400.4(1) differs from s 400.3(1) only in that the value of the money the subject of the offence is $100,000 or more. 

4""Deals with money"" is defined in s 400.2, in the following way: 

""400.2(1) For the purposes of this Division, a person deals with money ... if: 
(a) the person does any of the following: 
(i) receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money ... 
(ii) imports money ... into, or exports money ... from Australia; 
(iii) engages in a banking transaction relating to money ...; and 
(b) the money ... is proceeds of crime, or could become an instrument of crime, in relation to an offence that is: 
(i) a Commonwealth indictable offence; 
..."" 

5An ""instrument of crime"" is defined in s 400.1 in the following way: 

""money ... is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence ..."" 

6The charge against Gaurav Arora is formulated in the following terms: 

""[Gaurav Arora] did deal with money intending that the money will become an instrument of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money was $1,000,000.00 or more."" 

The charge against Jagdish Arora is identically framed, except that the value of the money the subject of the ""dealing"" was asserted to be $100,000 or more. 

7On 1 October 2010 solicitors acting for both plaintiffs sought, from the CDPP, further particulars of the charges. Relevantly for present purposes they asked: 

""2. In what manner is it alleged that the [plaintiffs] did 'deal' with the money? 

... 

4. Of what crime did the [plaintiffs] intend the money to become an 'instrument'?"" 

By letter dated 5 October 2010, the CDPP: 


answered the request numbered 2 by identifying the manner in which he alleged that the plaintiffs ""dealt"" with the money as purchasing multiple bank drafts or international money transfers by the exchange of cash at various bank branches (he attached a schedule of the transactions in which each plaintiff was alleged to have engaged); 

answered the request numbered 4 with a lengthy explanation, which included: 

""It is alleged that the [plaintiffs] conducted each transactions (sic) ... in a manner and form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the cash involved would not give rise to a significant cash transaction and accordingly not be reported by the banks to Austrac. 

... 

It is alleged that the [plaintiffs] dealt with the cash ... intending to structure the transactions so as to avoid the banks filing a significant cast transaction with Austrac."" 

8It was common ground that the crime so identified was the crime of ""structuring"" created by s 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 which is, relevantly, in the following terms: 

""(1) A person commits an offence against this section if: 
(a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and 
(b) having regard to: 
(i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: 
(A) the value of the currency involved in each transaction; 
(B) the aggregated value of the transactions; 
(C) the period of time over which the transactions took place; 
(D) the interval of time between any of the transactions; 
(E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and 
(ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; 
it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: 
(iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or 
(iv) ..."" 

9For present purposes, a ""non-reportable cash transaction"" is, essentially, a transaction involving less than $10,000. By s 7 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act , a transaction greater than that amount is ""a significant cash transaction"", and attracts mandatory reporting provisions to the ""AUSTRAC CEO"". Put simply, therefore, but adequately for present purposes, the offence of structuring is committed where two or more cash transactions, each involving less than $10,000, are made in circumstances that warranted the conclusion that the transactions were so structured in order to avoid mandatory reporting under s 7. 

10Structuring is an indictable offence. The maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 5 years. 




The facts upon which the prosecutions are based 

11The CDPP alleges that, over a period between 13 May 2004 and 4 February 2010, Jagdish Arora purchased 62 bank drafts to the value, in total, of $350,700. Each individual bank draft was in a sum less than $10,000. Accordingly, any two of the transactions could, if they otherwise came within s 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act , have constituted an offence of structuring. 

12The CDPP alleges that, over a period between 1 March 2006 and 4 September 2008 Gaurav Arora purchased 198 bank drafts, and international money transfers, to a value, in total, of $1,565,440, each individual transaction being of a value under $10,000. As in Jagdish Arora's case, any two of the transactions could, if they otherwise met the requirements of s 31(1), have constituted an offence of structuring. 

13Each plaintiff seeks a stay of the prosecution on two independent bases. 

(i) ""the charge is bad in law"" or ""duplicitous"" 

14The first basis concerns the manner in which the CDPP has particularised the charges. In my opinion, neither ""bad in law"" nor ""duplicitous"" accurately captures what the plaintiffs claim is the vice in the manner of charging: see the discussion of duplicity in R v Agius; R v Abibadra; R v Jandagi; R v Zerafa [2011] NSWSC 367. The point sought to be made is that, when properly analysed, the charges are tautologous. That can be explained by expanding the formulation of the charges as follows (bearing in mind the CDPP's particularisation of the ""dealing"" alleged): 

""... the plaintiffs did deal (by purchasing bank drafts, in successive transactions, each to a value of less than $10,000) with money, intending that the money will become an instrument of crime (in that it will be used to purchase bank drafts in successive transactions, each to a value of less than $10,000)."" 

15Put that way, that plaintiffs argue, it can be seen that the same activity - purchasing the bank drafts in successive transactions of under $10,000 in value - is alleged to constitute the ""dealing in money"" as well as the crime - structuring - for which the money is intended to be used as an instrument. 

16It is not an element of the money laundering offence that the dealing be in an amount under $10,000. Indeed the offences created by s 400.3 and s 400.4 require, respectively, dealings of $1,000,000 and $100,000 or more, although these may be made up of a series of lesser transactions, as is here alleged. It is an essential element of an offence of structuring that the cash transactions be in an amount less than $10,000. However, the money laundering pleaded (as particularised) could not be proved by the CDPP unless the amounts involved in the purchases of bank drafts were under $10,000. That is because he could not prove that the plaintiffs intended that the money in which they dealt would become the instrument of the crime of structuring, unless the transactions were in those amounts. And it is true that the purchase of the bank drafts is alleged to constitute the ""dealing"", and also to constitute the crime of structuring that the prosecution alleges for which the plaintiffs intended the (same) money to be used. 

17The plaintiffs' submission ignores an essential element of the offence of structuring. That offence is not committed until there have been at least two non-reportable cash transactions: the purchase of any of the bank drafts individually could not constitute the offence of structuring. It is therefore not quite correct to say that the ""dealing"" alleged is entirely co-extensive with the crime of which it is alleged the money was intended to be the instrument. 

18It is not, however, necessary to resolve this conceptually challenging question. That is because, notwithstanding the manner in which the CDPP has particularised the ""dealing"" alleged, ""dealing in money"" (for the purpose of the money laundering offences) is broadly defined, and includes possession of money. It is integral to the CDPP's case that the plaintiffs were, up to the time of purchase of the bank drafts, in possession of the various sums of money. Should the CDPP reconsider its position on the particularisation of the ""dealing"" alleged, to encompass possession, the plaintiffs' first argument evaporates. 

19A second argument, which, perhaps, rests on a firmer foundation, is that sub-para (1)(b)(ii) of s 400.3 and s 400.4 both require an intention that the money the subject of the dealing will (that is, in the future) become an instrument of crime. But, the argument goes, when the dealing is completed, the offence of structuring is also completed. There is no scope for a crime to be committed in the future. The dealing and the structuring, being, in effect, identical transactions, are necessarily simultaneous. 

20Senior counsel for the CDPP indicated an intention to revise the particularisation. That essentially concludes both arguments. ""Possession"" is not the same as ""purchasing"". And ""possession"" predates the purchasing said to constitute structuring. 

21Senior counsel for the plaintiffs nevertheless pressed for an order for stay of the prosecutions on the basis of the present particularisation. It seems to me that, to grant a stay on the basis of the present particularisation, in circumstances where an alternative is readily and simply (and obviously) available, would be a futility. If the CDPP revises his particulars - as far as I can see, that does not require any leave of any court - the stay would have to be discharged. 

(ii) abuse of process 

22The second basis upon which the plaintiffs sought a stay concerned what is said to be an abuse of process, or oppression. That was, so it was said, because the proper analysis of the conduct of the plaintiffs would dictate that they should be charged with the substantive offence of structuring, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years, as distinct from the 25 year maximum applicable to the s 400.3 offence, and 20 years applicable to the s 400.4 offence. 

23Reliance was placed upon a series of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in which criticism was made of the CDPP for prosecuting money laundering offences in conjunction with other offences. In Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; 198 A Crim R 135 the applicant had been charged with 11 counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and one of attempting to do so by making false claims for refunds under the GST legislation. He was also charged with one count of money laundering under s 400.4(1) of the Code. The money the subject of the money laundering charge was the proceeds of the fraud offences (that is, where the present charges rely on sub-para (b)(ii) of the sub-section creating the offence - that is, an intention that the money will become the instrument of crime - in Thorn , the CDPP relied upon sub-para (b)(i) - that the money was the proceeds of crime). Howie J, with whom Campbell JA and Rothman J agreed, considered this to be ""an unusual use"" of a money laundering offence, with an overlap between that and the fraud offences (at [27]). He said that the criminality ""was very much in the obtaining of the funds not in their use"". He drew an analogy with ""a robber being sentenced for both the robbery and being in possession of the stolen goods"". 

24It is apparent that the extent of overlap was not raised by that applicant's legal representatives, and it appears from the judgment that that applicant had pleaded guilty to all charges. 

25The Court reduced the sentences, but nevertheless retained, in respect of the money laundering offence, a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years and 8 months, which was partially accumulated upon the other sentences. In other words, the Court did not regard the additional criminality involved in the money laundering as negligible. 

26Similarly, in Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; 201 A Crim R 150 the applicant pleaded guilty to six charges under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) concerning the sale, or offering for sale, of unauthorised property, and to one offence of money laundering (dealing with the proceeds of crime) under s 400.6(1) of the Code. The items the subject of the money laundering offence were the very items that the applicant had sold or offered for sale. The Court referred to Thorn , and said that, in that case, as in Nahlous : 

""[14] ... the offence to a certain extent concerned the profits of the applicant's own criminality ..."" 

27The Court (of which Howie J was a member) quoted from [27] of Thorn and went on to say that it could see no justification whatever for the prosecution of the money laundering offence. The Court said: 

""[17] We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty."" 

The Court dismissed that charge under s 19B(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1914, stating its opinion that it was inexpedient to inflict any punishment in respect of that offence. 

28However, in R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370 this Court dealt with Crown appeals against sentence in respect of two offenders who had, like the present plaintiffs, been charged with (and pleaded guilty to) both structuring offences and money laundering offences. It was not suggested in that case that that involved an abuse of process, and, indeed, the Court (of which, again, Howie J was a member) said the following: 

""[34] The amount of money involved is clearly a highly significant matter [in relation to the money laundering offences] because the legislation uses it as the principal means of dividing the offences into categories and it is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence ... 

37 Sentences that have been imposed for offences in breach of s 31(1) of the [ Financial Transaction Reports ] Act are not a helpful guide to the sentence to be imposed for an offence contrary to s 400. This is not simply because of the difference in the maximum penalties prescribed for the different offences. Depositing sums of money in breach of the provisions of that Act to the extent that was embarked upon by the respondents and taking into account their knowledge of the purpose of the transactions imbues their criminal activity with a completely different complexion."" 

29The principal argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs was dependent upon the significant difference in the maximum penalties applicable, on the one hand, to structuring offences, and, on the other hand, to money laundering offences. It was accepted that the CDPP retains a significant degree of independence in respect of prosecutorial decisions. Nevertheless, it was submitted that the Court retains an overall supervisory role in order to prevent an abuse of the decision making process. 

30I accept that, to a limited extent, there is role for the Court to intervene in order to prevent abuse of its processes by the wrongful exercise of prosecutorial discretion. I was referred to no decision in which the Court had exercised that limited power in such a way as to determine the nature of the charges to be preferred against an accused person. I do not see the decision to prosecute the plaintiffs in respect of money laundering, as distinct from structuring, offences, as involving any such abuse. 

31I observe that the options available to the CDPP in respect of each plaintiff were not, simply, a charge of money laundering, or a single charge of structuring. Every two purchases of bank drafts exposed the plaintiffs to charges of structuring; there are numerous ways in which, if only structuring were charged, it would have been open to the CDPP to divide the transactions in order to prosecute multiple offences of structuring with potentially cumulative penalties. 

32In any event, when the amount of money involved, particularly in the case of Guarav Arora, is considered, it can be seen that it would be inappropriate to prosecute on a single charge of structuring, carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. The same applies, although with less force, to the case of Jagdish Arora. 

33I am satisfied that no abuse such as to warrant the intervention of this Court has been demonstrated. 

34In each case the summons is dismissed.

		10 June 2011",2011-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757167,REBERGER v R [2011] NSWCCA 132,"Judgment 

1CAMPBELL JA: The Applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 31 May 2010 concerning a single offence to which he had pleaded guilty. That offence was a contravention of s 35(2) Crimes Act 1900 , consisting of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Timothy Uren on 23 May 2009. The Applicant was born in June 1985, and so was aged 23, nearly 24, at the time of the offence. 

2The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Pursuant to s 54A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the Table immediately following s 54D of that Act, it also has a standard non-parole period of 4 years. 

3The sentence the judge imposed was imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years 11 months and 2 days commencing on 31 May 2010 and expiring on 2 May 2013. The total term of imprisonment imposed was 4 years 10 months and 15 days commencing on 31 May 2010 and expiring on 14 April 2015. The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 

The Incident 

4The most significant factual material before the judge concerning the circumstances of the incident that resulted in the charge was a Statement of Agreed Facts. It records that on Friday, 22 May 2009 Mr Uren, then aged 20, went first with family and friends to a hotel in Wagga Wagga to celebrate his father's birthday. There Mr Uren consumed about five or six glasses of beer. Mr Uren later went with friends to a different hotel in Wagga Wagga, where they consumed more alcoholic beverages. 

5At about 1:50 am the following morning Mr Uren left that hotel with a friend, Michael Hotston, and walked across the street, intending to go to a service station to ring a taxi to go home. He saw a heated verbal argument between two males of Aboriginal appearance and two males of Caucasian appearance outside a third hotel. The two Caucasian males were the Applicant and a friend of his, Matthew Hobson. The argument ended and the two males of Aboriginal appearance walked off in a northerly direction. The Applicant and Mr Hobson then walked in a southerly direction towards Mr Uren and Mr Hotston. 

6The Statement of Agreed Facts then described the incident: 

""Mr Uren and the Offender did not know each other, never having met before. A bystander, who knew both Mr Uren and the Offender, noticed that the Offender had a schooner (beer) glass in his hand, and that there was about an inch of beer in the bottom of the glass. That bystander had a short conversation with Mr Uren. He noticed that Mr Uren appeared fairly drunk, but in a good mood. 

As the Offender and his friend neared Mr Uren and his friend, Mr Uren said to the Offender something like, 'What's going on down there?' At that time the Offender was holding the schooner glass in his hand. Without any provocation, and whilst still holding the schooner glass, the Offender punched the right-hand side of Mr Uren's face with his hand. The schooner glass shattered on impact with the side of Mr Uren's face. Mr Uren fell to the footpath, having suffered serious wounds to his face, and right eye. The Offender and his associate ran south on Fitzmaurice Street and out of sight."" 

Alcohol Consumption 

7In an interview with a Probation and Parole Officer for the purpose of a pre-sentence report, the Applicant said that his recollection of the offence: 

""... was not clear due to his state of intoxication, which followed a bout of drinking with friends at a hotel where he consumed a large quantity of alcohol."" 

8The Applicant's mother gave evidence at the hearing, in which she accepted that the Applicant had been drinking prior to the incident, and that she had ""heard about the fact that he was intoxicated"" . She said that that took her by surprise, because only very rarely had she seen the Applicant drinking alcohol. She was not cross-examined. 

The Applicant's Police Statement 

9After a call from the police to the Applicant's mother, the Applicant attended the Wagga Wagga police station soon after 6:00pm on 23 May 2009. In the presence of his father, and against the advice of his solicitor, he participated in a recorded interview with police officers. The Statement of Agreed Facts says: 

""During the interview the Offender stated that he had been with friends at the 'older pub' with the Chinese restaurant (Home Tavern Hotel). He had drunk some beers earlier in the night; and after arriving at the hotel drank some Vodka Red Bull (a vodka mixed-drink). He said that he was not 'pissed' (intoxicated) at the time. He said that he and his friend left the hotel, and walked across Kincaid Street, to the footpath opposite the hotel, where they had an argument with two Aboriginal men. The Offender and his friend then walked south along the western footpath of Fitzmaurice Street to the front of Embellish Hair and Beauty, 130 Fitzmaurice Street, opposite the Duke of Kent Hotel. 

The Offender stated that a male person then ran at him, and punched him to the left side of his face. The Offender said that he took two or three steps back, and punched this male person three or four times to the head. He stated that he did not have a beer glass in his hand when he punched the male person. The Offender and his mate ran along Fitzmaurice Street to the Victory Memorial Gardens. A short while a woman arrived and drove them away. That woman was the female partner of the Offender's mate. 

During the morning, the Offender and his partner received a number of text messages asking the Offender if he had 'bottled' someone down-town. The Offender denied doing this, but admitting to being involved in a fight."" 

The Statement of Facts records that the Applicant was co-operative during the time he was in police custody. 

Effect on the Victim 

10After the incident Mr Uren was taken by ambulance to the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, and later to the Sydney Eye Hospital. 

11Dr Ross Benger is an occuplastic surgeon. He had had over 40 years experience as a surgeon in May 2009. At about 8:00 am on 23 May 2009 he was telephoned by the ophthalmology registrar at the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, who told him that Mr Uren had received a glassing injury to his right eye region, and had no vision in his right eye. A CT scan of the head/orbits had been performed and showed large pieces of glass within his right orbit. Dr Benger agreed to have Mr Uren transferred to his care at the Sydney Eye Hospital. He first saw Mr Uren around 6:00 pm on 23 May 2009. He described his treatment of Mr Uren on that day and successive days: 

""6. When I removed Timothy's right eye dressing, it was evident that he had sustained horrific injuries. His right eyeball was collapsed, and a large piece of glass could be seen in/above it. A further piece of glass could be seen in the lacerated right upper eyelid. Timothy not surprisingly had no vision at all in his right eye. His left eye was normal. 

7. Timothy's injuries were repaired at Sydney Eye Hospital on Sunday 24 th May 2009 in a four hour operation with him having a general anaesthetic administered ... . The two fragments of glass were so large that they extended to the posterior limit of Timothy's right orbit. He was fortunate that the glass had not penetrated the superior orbital fissure, into his brain. His right eye was cut in half, and the intraocular lens was missing. The pieces of glass were removed, and given to the Operating Theatre Sister in Charge to be kept in the refrigerator so that they could be given subsequently to the Wagga Wagga Police team. ... Timothy's extensive right upper and lower eyelid, cheek and eyebrow injuries were meticulously closed in layers. The lacerated tissues in Timothy's right lower eyelid and cheek were like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, but all were retained and remained viable over the course of his hospital stay. A plastic porous polyethylene (Medpor) ball was placed within Timothy's right eyeball sclera (white layer), in the hope that he would get an optimal result when eventually fitted with a prosthetic ('glass') acrylic eye. Timothy was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday 27 th May 2009.""

12Dr Benger's expert report gave his opinion about the injury: 

""8. Timothy will need to have his prosthetic eye re-manufactured in about two years, and thereafter every four years or so. It is yet to be determined whether Timothy will have inflammatory changes with eye socket discharge in response to wearing his ocular prosthesis. 

9. Timothy has no hope for recovery of any vision in his right eye. All the vision in his right eye was lost at the moment of being struck. This has very significant implications for him in terms of depth perception/stereopsis, and this is particularly relevant given his occupation of builder. It remains to be seen whether Timothy will be able to continue in his employment, given the need for climbing ladders and working on scaffolding and roofing. 

10. The injury is classed as both serious and permanent. In fact, it is probably the worst eye region injury in terms of outcome that I have ever seen in my years of dealing with trauma cases at hospitals."" 

13At the sentencing hearing it was common ground that after Mr Uren fell to the ground a good Samaritan came by and applied pressure to the eye region to stem the flow of blood, and that it was a possibility that the glass that was found in Mr Uren's eye was further driven into the eye by the compression. 

14Forensic evidence later established an identity between the glass removed from Mr Uren's eye and glass found at the scene of the incident. 

15In a follow-up report of 4 March 2010 Dr Benger summarised the original injuries as including: 

""Penetrating injury of the right eye, resulting in loss of the eye. A prosthetic implant is now in situ. 

Extreme laceration of the right upper and lower eyelids and right mid face."" 

16He identified problems that may be encountered in the long term as including: 

""Loss of depth perception due to loss of the eye. 

Exuberant scarring of the repaired skin laceration. 

Drooping of the right upper or lower eyelid requiring surgical repair, 

Sinking back of the prosthetic implant requiring surgical rescission."" 

17Kerri Wilson, who specialises in ocular prosthetics, has been involved in providing a prosthetic eye for Mr Uren. In a report dated 22 February 2010 she stated that the prosthesis requires constant care and cleaning. She also stated: 

""Conjunctivitis occurs more commonly with artificial eye wearers and requires prompt medical treatment. 

In particular allergic GPC (Giant capillary conjunctivitis) can be difficult to treat. It can cause the eye wearer great discomfort. 

The prosthesis will be due for a replacement in approximately one year's time; this is because expected changes occur to the shape of the socket during the first year after enucleation. 

... 

Depth perception can be a problem for some people. Walking up and down steps and/or pouring drinks are instances which require extra care and negotiation. Distances, can be difficult to judge also. For most people these problems improve over time but for some it remains a constant struggle."" 

Supplementary Evidence 

18After judgment had been reserved in this matter the Court received notification from the solicitor for the DPP that the Crown wished to rely upon additional evidence. The Court gave directions for the filing of that evidence and submissions relating to it. 

19The evidence in question is a further report from Dr Benger. The relevant portion is: 

""Timothy Uren attended my outpatient clinic at Sydney Eye Hospital on 18 th April 2011. He had developed another ulcer/erosion in his right eye socket. This exposed the porous polyethylene Medpor sphere which was implanted in his right eye socket on Sunday 24 th May 2009 as part of the original injury repair. Timothy will need to have the area patched again with a graft of tissue taken from his abdominal wall. 

The severity of Timothy's injuries, and the disruption to his normal expected lifestyle, should not be underestimated. The multiple lacerations of his right eye/eye socket tissues resulted in more scarring and therefore a decrease in blood supply than when a person's eyeball is removed because of eg cancer. This means that Timothy is prone to developing more tissue ulcers with implant exposure. It is not possible to predict how many more surgical interventions Timothy will need in his lifetime to address the direct results of him being injured on 23 rd May 2009."" 

20Supplementary submissions from the Crown submitted that the evidence should be received as evidence of post-sentence events that can be taken into account for the purpose of re-sentencing, or alternatively on the basis that the evidence demonstrates the true significance or provides the basis for a full appreciation of facts that were in evidence at the time of sentencing before the sentencing judge: R v Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455; (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 at [121]-[124]; R v Baxter [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at [1]-[19], [62]; Springer v R [2007] NSWCCA 289; (2007) 177 A Crim R 13 at [2]-[3]. 

21As will later appear, it is necessary for the Applicant to be re-sentenced. The Applicant accepts that the evidence can properly be taken into account for the purpose of re-sentencing. In those circumstances it is not necessary to consider whether any other basis upon which the evidence might have been received would also apply. 

22Though Dr Benger's earlier report had identified that Mr Uren's future treatment might involve surgical intervention, it did not specifically identify a risk that ulceration or erosion of the tissue of the eye might occur, and possibly recur, or that the method of treatment was to graft tissue taken from another part of the body. 

Applicant's Prior Offences 

23The Applicant's criminal history, prior to the incident the subject of the present charge, showed him as having come before a Local Court in substance on two occasions, each time for driving offences. He was convicted on each offence charged, and received penalties that did not involve imprisonment. His record also shows an appearance in the Wagga Wagga District Court, but that appearance related to some severity appeals from some of the convictions I have just mentioned. Alcohol was not involved in any of the offences. 

Applicant's Prior Medical History 

24From the time he was at least eight years old, the Applicant has periodically seen a variety of medical practitioners, other health professionals and school counsellors, whose reports were available to the sentencing judge. He came under attention because he was showing significant learning difficulties associated with Attention Deficit Disorder. 

25IQ tests that he completed as a child showed him achieving low scores, but the extent to which the scores were low differed. A test administered in February 1996 showed him falling in percentile 16.2 of the population for verbal IQ, percentile 6.0 for performance IQ, and percentile 6.0 for full scale IQ. A test administered in June 1998 showed him falling within percentile 0.1 for the verbal dimension, percentile 0.4 for the performance dimension, and percentile 0.1 for the full scale test. 

26Some years before 1998 the Applicant had a chromosome analysis which indicated that he had a condition known as 47, XYY, also known as Jacob's Syndrome. 

27An IQ assessment carried out in the middle of 2002 using an adult IQ test put him in the third percentile of his age group, a score described as placing him ""on the cusp of the Borderline/Mild Intellectual Disability categories"" . A counsellor's report at the time said: 

""Generally speaking, individuals operating at this level in the workplace require a greater degree of supervision, would be slower at learning new skills - typically requiring greater explanations and needing more repetitions before achieving competence. Even then many tasks may be beyond them, and some tasks may never be completed at what would be called normal speed."" 

28While he struggled at school, the Applicant has maintained himself in employment since he left school. Initially he worked for his father in the building industry, and did a bricklaying apprenticeship. This involved him completing some courses at Albury TAFE, for which he stayed with a family who spoke very well of him. At the time of the trial he was working as a scaffolder. He has formed a relationship with a young woman, with whom he had been living for some time before the trial, and was planning to marry. Throughout his life, he has received ongoing and extensive support and encouragement from his parents and two siblings. He tendered a large number of favourable character references. 

Dr Rowe's Report 

29Dr Donald Rowe is a consultant neuropsychologist, neurophysiologist and clinical psychologist. He administered a battery of tests to the Applicant, was provided with the police Statement of Agreed Facts and reports of previous medical practitioners, medical health professionals and counsellors who had previously assessed the Applicant, and saw the Applicant over a period of about four hours. Dr Rowe produced a report dated 20 May 2010. In it he recounted, under the heading ""Background"" a prcis of the agreed facts relating to the circumstances of the offence and the Applicant's statement to the police. 

30Dr Rowe did not have any official record relating to the Applicant's criminal history, but was told about it by the Applicant's father, in a detail that a formal history of charges, convictions and penalties cannot adequately capture: 

""Ryan's first offence was at sixteen years of age involving driving an unregistered vehicle on a reserve, he then lost his licence under the points system for speeding whilst on a provisional licence. He then drove again whilst disqualified from driving. Once again he was caught driving unregistered and unlicensed where on that occasion he drove off, abandoned the vehicle and was chased and apprehended on foot."" 

31Dr Rowe's comment on the history was: 

""Ryan does not have an extensive criminal history suggesting an absence of any antisocial type personality disorder. However, he does show a tendency for impulsive mannerisms and poor consequential thinking. Given his young age, he does have a relatively extensive traffic history that indicates a disregard for the law and a failure to learn from consequences. 

In particular, the inability to inhibit behavioural responses relating to executive function impairments in ADD, as discussed further below, leads to risk taking behaviour such as drug and alcohol abuse, tobacco smoking, criminal behaviours, driving anger, traffic offences and accident proneness."" 

32Dr Rowe recounted some matters of the Applicant's general background. These included a statement that he had had intellectual difficulties since the age of three, and that his parents said that even today ""his intellectual ability is very limited and he cannot read or write. They said that he is open to persuasion and has limited understanding about what is going on with respect to his legal issues."" Dr Rowe also gave a prcis of the previous medical and other related reports. 

33On the basis of tests that he had administered, Dr Rowe reported that the Applicant had both Mild to Moderate Mental Retardation (MMR) and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) published by the American Psychiatric Association. 

34While the Applicant's results considered overall were low, he scored considerably higher on some of the attributes that were measured than on others. Dr Rowe reported that he had: 

""27. ... a broad range of cognitive disabilities with the majority of measures in the significantly impaired range and below the 1 st percentile, consistent with his previous intellectual assessments and his history of mild to moderate mental retardation (developmental disability). 

28. Ryan's strengths were measured on relatively simple tests of short term and working memory with scores in the 3 rd to 14 th percentile for forwards and reverse digits memory, and 30 th to 32 nd percentile for visual spatial memory. He was also measured as showing reasonable reaction time measurements in the low average range and a category fluency score in the 22 nd percentile. Otherwise he was significantly impaired on the remainder of measures. 

29. Ryan's neuropsychological test findings were consistent with the pattern of deficits that are often measured in cases of severe adult ADD and Mild to Moderate Mental Retardation. 

30. Ryan's cognitive difficulties would have been expected to be of greater magnitude under the intoxicating effects of alcohol."" 

35Dr Rowe's report included the following conclusions: 

""3. Ryan's abnormal XYY genotype, particularly where mental retardation is present, in some cases is a known precipitator of aggressive behaviours and criminality. In my opinion, Ryan's good parenting and professional care and remediation has largely suppressed such antisocial tendencies, with the exception of during novel circumstances such as the situation which arose on 22 May 2009. 

4. In my opinion, at the time of Ryan's offence on 22 May 2009 he was affected by the cognitive impairments that result from MMR and ADD, and the intoxicating effects of alcohol ... The cognitive impairments that result from Ryan's MMR and ADD are greater than that which is caused by either disorder alone. It follows that individuals such as Ryan who are afflicted with MMR, ADD and the XYY karotype are vulnerable to poor judgement, impulsivity and poor consequential thinking together with potentially thoughtless acts that can lead to aggressive behaviours and legal predicaments. In my opinion, the combined effects of Ryan's MMR, ADD and a genetic abnormality led to his offence on 22 May 2009 and that of prior traffic related offences ."" (emphasis added) 

36Dr Rowe expressed his opinion about the effect of the ADD from which the Applicant suffered: 

""Core symptoms of ADD include impulsivity, executive function difficulties (poor planning, organisation), poor consequential thinking, difficulties with concentration, and becoming irritable and upset by minor annoyances. Many individuals with ADD also suffer from alcohol and drug problems. One of the most significant features of ADD is an inability to learn from prior mistakes despite repeated punishment. These cognitive deficits are further exacerbated in patients with mental retardation due to their existing low cognitive reserve."" 

37Dr Rowe also reported: 

""Individuals, such as Ryan who are afflicted with MMR and ADD and are users of alcohol will suffer from greater cognitive impairments, than those afflicted by either disorder alone. 

It follows that such individuals afflicted with MMR and ADD can be prone to rash or impulsive and aggressive behaviours with little or no thought of the consequences of those behaviours, particularly when they are under the influence of the intoxicating effects of alcohol. They can also be very easily externally regulated by vices in their environment such as alcohol, drugs or other behaviours such as driving when they should not, which they will often participate in out of impulsivity and as a form of self-medication to make themselves feel better. 

As a result individuals such as Ryan can show severe lapses in judgement and engage in impulsive behaviours that can create social and/or legal problems for them, particularly when they are not fully treated and when they suffering from the intoxicating effects of alcohol. This is despite being given prior punishment and instruction, particularly whilst remaining untreated and suffering from mental retardation.

... 

Alcohol being a depressant leads to further impairment in executive function and subsequent irrational judgement and risk taking behaviours. The immediate effects of alcohol has a further effect that alone alcohol can led to a disinhibited state where an individual can show increased aggression, socially hyperactive behaviour and/or impulsivity. The majority of people can still resist participation in illegal activities under the influence of high blood concentrations of alcohol. However, Ryan's MMD and ADD illnesses result in a greater susceptibility to the effects [of] alcohol and associated susceptibility to impulsive and aggressive behaviours. 

In my opinion, Ryan's behaviour on 22 May 2009 was characteristic of an impulsive and unconsidered thought process brought about by the effects of his affliction with underlying developmental disability MMR and mental illness ADD, together with the intoxicating effects of alcohol. His behaviour is consistent with his previously reported impulsive and 'panic' like, behaviours without careful evaluation of the situation or consideration of the consequences."" 

38In his view: 

""... Ryan impulsively struck the victim without appropriately considering the potential damage he could inflict on that victim or the fact that he was carrying a glass at the time. In my opinion, his reasoning was limited to that of an aggressive and reactive child."" 

39Dr Rowe was of the view that a treatment regime involving significant reduction or elimination of alcohol consumption, regular consultations with a psychologist to administer cognitive behavioural therapy, consultation with a medical practitioner concerning prescription of a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic, and certain other drugs, would be more likely to lead to the Applicant's successful rehabilitation than would imprisonment. He urged the court to consider a suspended sentence and bond, on condition that the Applicant participate in the recommended treatment programme. 

Ground 1 

40The first ground of appeal is that in rejecting Dr Rowe's opinion as to a causal connection between the Applicant's cognitive impairments and the commission of the offence, her Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration. 

41In her remarks on sentence, the judge recorded that Dr Rowe had found a causal connection between the Applicant's mental impairment and the offence. The judge said that: 

""One of the difficulties in accepting unequivocally the opinion of Dr Rowe is that his opinion is based, in part, on the version given to police by the offender, that is, that he was run at and punched to the left side of his face."" 

42She noted that that version was not corroborated by eyewitnesses. She also referred to the offender's statement to the police, that he was not holding a schooner glass, as being contradicted by the evidence of the eyewitnesses and ultimately the forensic evidence. She found that the Applicant's version given to the police was unreliable, and that Dr Rowe's basing his opinion on it in part impacted upon the opinion of the doctor as to the causal relationship between the mental impairment of the Applicant and the commission of the offence and the degree of intoxication. 

43In my view, the sentencing judge erred in regarding Dr Rowe's opinion about the causal connection between the Applicant's mental condition and the incident the subject of the charge as being based in part on the incorrect version that the Applicant gave to the police. Rather, Dr Rowe's opinion was based upon his diagnosis of the Applicant as suffering from MMR, severe adult ADD and a genetic abnormality, and the known tendency for those conditions when accompanied by consumption of alcohol to result in impulsive and aggressive behaviour. 

44The Crown accepts that the Court might grant leave concerning this ground. 

45Leave should be granted concerning the first ground of appeal, and it should be upheld. The judge's view about the basis of Dr Rowe's opinion has the result that the judge sentenced the Applicant on an incorrect factual basis. 

Ground 2 

46The second ground of appeal is that it was not open to her Honour to reject Dr Rowe's opinion as to the causal connection between the Applicant's cognitive impairment and the commission of the offence. 

47The manner in which the Crown submitted the sentencing judge should deal with the Applicant's mental shortcomings was: 

""... other than on this night when he had consumed a large amount of alcohol, he has not had any difficulty as a result of those particular conditions. His mother gave evidence here today that she had never seen him behave in a violent way and particularly not with any degree of weapon. There is nothing on his criminal history to indicate such. 

So it's submitted your Honour that his mental conditions had no or little impact on his offending. What it was was his consumption of alcohol."" 

48Dr Rowe was not required for cross-examination. A court can sometimes reject evidence that has not been cross-examined on, if, for example, it was inconsistent with other evidence that the court accepted, or was inherently incredible ( Paric v John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 505 at 507; Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553 at 586-588; Caldwell v J A Neilson Investments Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 3; (2007) 14 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-724 at [96]; Masterton Homes Pty Ltd v Palm Assets Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 234; (2009) 261 ALR 382 at [105]). However this is not such a case. In the absence of cross-examination it was not open to the judge to reject Dr Rowe's opinion that the incident was a consequence of the combined operation of the Applicant's mental disabilities and consumption of alcohol. Leave to appeal should be granted concerning this ground, and the ground should be upheld. 

Grounds 3 and 4 

49Ground 3 is 

""It was not open to Her Honour to treat the need for general deterrence the same as for an offender without the applicant's cognitive impairment."" 

50Ground 4 is: 

""Her Honour erred in not discernibly moderating the need for the sentence to promote general deterrence."" 

51These two grounds can conveniently be discussed together. 

52The judge noted a submission on behalf of the Applicant that he was an inappropriate medium for general deterrence. She said: 

""I am not persuaded that that is so. He is someone who had difficulty with his schooling and clearly had behavioural problems, but, with parental guidance and remedial assistance, he was able to leave school, obtain employment and earn the respect of his employers. He has been able to form a relationship and he has plans to marry. 

But he is clearly not the mild-mannered young man his counsel is seeking to portray on sentence. Dr Rowe's reports contains histories from the offender's partner and family that he can be 'hot-headed', he does have a 'bad temper', he gets angry and he gets frustrated. They all stop short of giving a history of any displays of violence as an adult, contrary to the history given by his mother to Dr Rowe that as a youngster he was at times physically violent. 

His ability to lead a relatively normal life, despite his mild intellectual impairment, demonstrates someone who functions at a level in society more normal than not. It has not impacted on is ability to obtain a driver's licence, nor licences to operate machinery."" 

53The judge went on to note the evidence of the Applicant's mother that he had never shown signs of aggression and was not to her knowledge a drinker. The judge said that she did not accept the evidence as to never showing signs of aggression, nor as to his not being a drinker. The judge expressed the view that the Applicant's mother was unconsciously colouring her evidence. She concluded, on this topic: 

""There remains a requirement for a sentence to reflect the need for general deterrence, even if not in full measure, as well as specific deterrence. Inquiries made by the Probation Service resulted in a disclosure of a consumption of alcohol in the company of his partner and friends but not considered by others to be excessive or problematic. Perhaps that is something which those others may now need to re-think."" 

54In R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36] Sperling J identified mental illness as being relevant in sentencing in the following ways: 

"" ... First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23]; Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51]; Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]. 

Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Pearce (NSWCCA, 1 November 1996, unreported); Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (NSWCCA, 18 March 1992, unreported); Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]. 

Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Tsiaras at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]. 

A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence; Israil at [24]."" 

55That passage was quoted with apparent approval by RA Hulme J (Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing) in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140 at [48]. While the Applicant in the present case suffers from a mental impairment, rather than a mental illness, those remarks are applicable to his sentencing. 

56Concerning the reduced significance of general deterrence when sentencing an offender who had a degree of mental impairment at the time of commission of the offence, Grove J in Hemsley , (Dowd J agreeing) said at [5]: 

""... It is not the case that persons afflicted by an underlying mental incapacity are exempt from any inclusion of an element of general deterrence in sentence assessment but it was requisite for consideration to be given to whether, in the circumstances of this appellant, that element should be included, excluded or ameliorated."" 

57In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, Gleeson CJ (Allen J agreeing) at 71 quoted with approval the statement of the Chief Justice of Victoria in R v Mooney (Supreme Court of Victoria Full Court, 21 June 1978, unreported) (reproduced with approval in R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at 86) that: 

"" ... General deterrence should often be given little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others."" 

58Gleeson CJ also quoted at 71 the statement of Badgery-Parker J in R v Letteri (NSWCCA, 18 March 1992, unreported) that: 

""Whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap. In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produced the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise."" 

59Gleeson J said, at 71, that he emphasised the concluding sentence in that passage. 

60In R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [254] Wood CJ at CL explained further: 

""The reason for this approach lies in the circumstance that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice.""

61It can be in accord with principle for a judge to sentence a person with a mental condition on a basis that includes an element of general deterrence: Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307 at [25]-[28]. 

62That is what the sentencing judge has done in the present case - she has taken into account the need for general deterrence, but not to the same extent as would be appropriate for a person who did not suffer from the mental impairment that the Applicant has. I would not uphold ground 3, because it mischaracterises the judge's process of reasoning. 

63In circumstances where the judge has to some extent moderated the need for the sentence to promote general deterrence, all that can remain of ground 4 is a contention that the judge attributed an incorrect weight to general deterrence, and ought to have accorded it less weight than she did. That is a difficult ground on which to succeed on an appeal against a discretionary judgment, such as a sentence. 

64In Minehan v R , RA Hulme J (Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing), said at [59]-[60], concerning a submission that a particular factor had not been given appropriate weight by the sentencing judge: 

""... as Johnson J recently observed in Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121: 

[40] Circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by this court are narrowly confined, whether the proceeding is a Crown appeal or an offender's application for leave to appeal with respect to sentence: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]; Cao v R [ 2010] NSWCCA 109 at [57]. 

The weight that a sentencing judge gave, or did not give, to a specific issue is impossible to determine with any precision. The only real measure is the sentence ultimately imposed."" 

65It is not necessary to decide whether ground 4 is one that would have been upheld, if it were the only ground. The errors that have been established concerning grounds 1 and 2 have the consequence that, in performing the task that s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 requires the court to perform, it will be necessary for the court to decide whether some other sentence should have been passed, other than the one that the judge passed. In so deciding, the court will take into account the extent to which general deterrence should have been treated as a relevant factor in sentencing the Applicant. 

66I say now that in my view, there is force in Ms Riggs' submission that the judge took every positive achievement of the Applicant, made in the face of great difficulty and only with enormous parental assistance, and turned these into reasons for not reducing the sentence (or, as is more appropriate when her Honour did not give general deterrence its full measure in the present case, for not reducing the sentence very much). 

67I will return to this topic below. 

Grounds 5, 6, 7 and 8 

68Ground 5 is: 

""Her Honour erred in her assessment of the objective gravity of the offence"". 

69Ground 6 is: 

""Her Honour erred in the use to which she put the favourable subjective circumstances found."" 

70Ground 7 is: 

""Her Honour erred in failing to state reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period."" 

71Ground 8 was not pressed. 

72Ms Belinda Riggs appeared for the Applicant. Her submissions dealt with these grounds together. I shall do likewise. 

73The objective seriousness of the offence has a particular statutory role to play in the present case because the offence in question is one in relation to which a standard non-parole period has been set. Section 54A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act says: 

""For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division."" 

74Section 54B of that Act constrains the manner in which a court may go about fixing a non-parole period for an offence in relation to which a standard non-parole period has been set: 

""(2) When determining the sentence for the offence (not being an aggregate sentence), the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 

(3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 

(4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 

... 

(5) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence."" 

75The judge described the objective characteristics of the injury that Mr Uren had sustained, and repeated Dr Benger's description of them as ""horrific"" . She referred to a victim impact statement from Mr Uren, in which he described the shock and anxiety he had sustained at being told he was to lose his right eye, the trauma associated with the surgery and the aftermath, and the impact the loss of his eye has had upon his ability to lead a normal life. Mr Uren works as a carpenter, and thus his lack of stereoscopic vision interferes with his work. The scarring of his face, which required about 100 stitches, cannot be hidden and distresses him. The judge said that the offence ""falls at the upper end of the range of injuries sustained"". 

76Her Honour recognised that some injuries that are even more serious than those of Mr Uren fell within the scope of the offence. She then went on to say ""... this is an offence, the consequences of which do fall, as I have found, at the upper end of the range, if not at the top."" 

77Let me say clearly that this ""it is A if not B"" form of words is not a desirable one to use in sentencing. Considered by itself, it has two possible meanings. One is that the objective seriousness is in the upper end of the range, but is not at the top of the range. The other is that it is at the upper end of the range, and might also possibly be at the top. In the overall context of the judge's sentencing remarks, however, it is fairly clear that she intended the first of these possible meanings. 

78One respect in which the judge erred in her assessment of objective seriousness concerns the identity of the ""range"" that the judge was considering. The task that application of ss 54A and 54B requires to be performed is to assess the objective seriousness of the offence . While evaluating the seriousness of any injury that the victim has sustained is part of that task, it is not the whole of the task. I accept Ms Riggs' submissions that the absence of premeditation and the fact that the offence comprised one blow only are relevant to its objective seriousness, and that the judge has shown no sign of having taken them into account. 

79Further, assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence should be carried out bearing in mind the remarks of this Court (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J) in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [85]-[88]: 

""It is too narrow a perspective to confine attention to the physical acts of the offender and their effects, as those acts or effects could be observed by a bystander. The inquiry which we consider to have been intended is one that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender (see for example R Fox and A Freiberg, Sentencing , 2nd ed (1999) South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, at pars 3.506 to 3.510). 

Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said 'objectively' to affect the 'seriousness' of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender's capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected: Channon v The Queen (1978) 33 FLR 433 and R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence. 

Questions of degree and remoteness arise which will need to be developed in the case law. There are potential areas of overlap. For example, impaired mental or intellectual functioning can go to either, or both, the seriousness of the offence and punishment, so far as deterrence is concerned. 

In an assessment of the objective seriousness of the subject offence it seems to us that attention must accordingly be given to the factors mentioned above. Some of these relevant factors will be elements of the offence itself. Others will fall within the list of aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(2) and (3) of the Act, so far as they relate to purely objective considerations."" 

80Though the judge did not specifically refer to the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , she fairly clearly had them in mind, as she listed various of them in language closely approximating that of s 21A. She found, echoing s 21A(2)(g), that ""the ongoing emotional and physical harm suffered to be substantial"" . She found, echoing s 21A(2)(c), that ""the use of the glass constitutes the use of a weapon"" . 

81The first mitigating factor her Honour recognised was that the Applicant had pleaded guilty, and done so at the first opportunity. She said she allowed him a 25% discount for his plea. She also found, as mitigating factors, that the Applicant was truly remorseful and contrite, that he had shown empathy for the victim (echoing s 21A(3)(i)), that he was highly unlikely to re-offend (s 21A(3)(g)), and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation if he undertook the treatment regime recommended by Dr Rowe (s 21A(3)(h)). She found that he was of otherwise good character apart from his traffic matters (s 21A(3)(f)). 

82However her Honour did not use the aggravating and mitigating factors in the way the statute requires. Her Honour referred to the 10 year maximum penalty for the offence. Her conclusion was that, "" having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender, it falls above the mid-range ... even taking into account the plea of guilty."" This is the only passage in which the judge referred to the seriousness of the offence. However, it is not the assessment of objective seriousness of the offence that is called for by ss 54A and 54B, but rather an overall assessment of the seriousness of both objective and subjective matters relevant to the offence. 

83Further, the judge has failed to carry out the task that s 54B(3) and (4) requires, of identifying reasons, of a type set out in s 21A, for setting a non-parole period shorter than the standard non-parole period. The use to which she put the various factors in s 21 was to arrive at a conceptual amalgam of the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. She then compared this conceptual amalgam with a supposed "" mid-range "" . Whatever that "" mid-range"" might be of, it is not the mid-range of objective seriousness of offences that s 54A identifies as the relevant concept for imposition of a parole period that takes into account the standard non-parole period. 

84For these reasons, I would uphold grounds 5, 6 and 7. 

85Her Honour said that had the matter gone to trial, she would have imposed a head sentence of 6 years and 6 months imprisonment. She concluded that, of the sentencing options available, only a sentence of full-time imprisonment would satisfy the requirements of general and specific deterrence. She made a finding of special circumstances by reason that his ""mild intellectual impairment ... will make his time in custody more onerous"" , that it would be his first time in custody, and ""there is a need for a lengthy period of supervised parole to ensure that when he is released he is provided with the assistance he will need to minimise the risk of re-offending and enhance his prospects for rehabilitation."" 

86Though she did not spell out the mathematics, it seems as though her Honour arrived at the head sentence by calculating 75% of the 6 years and 6 months imprisonment that she said she would have imposed had the matter gone to trial, and then arrived at the non-parole period as being approximately 60% of the head sentence thus arrived at. 

87The errors in the manner by which the judge arrived at the sentence require this court to carry out the task prescribed by s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act and decide whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 

88Dr Rowe's recommendation about sentence (para [39] above) would have a lot to recommend it if the only relevant matter in sentencing was what would be most likely to rehabilitate the Applicant. But sentencing must take into account numerous objectives (s 3A Sentencing Procedure Act ), not all of which tend in the same direction, and of which rehabilitation is only one. 

89It is undoubtedly serious to glass a person and cause them to lose an eye and have their face scarred. The use of a weapon, and the ongoing emotional and physical harm suffered by Mr Uren, including the complications that Dr Benger's latest report describe, must also enter into assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. However the objective seriousness of the present offence is reduced because of the impulsiveness of the action, being more a spur of the moment reaction than in any way planned; it consisting in a single blow; and its cause lying in the mental deficiencies of the Applicant. Further, it is not as though those mental deficiencies manifested themselves in violence on the night of the incident because the Applicant deliberately engaged in a course of conduct that he knew had a real risk of precipitating violence. There had not previously been an incident where consumption of alcohol had been part of the reason why he had been violent, nor is there any reason to believe that he had been warned that he was at risk of being violent if he consumed alcohol. His situation is not like that of the mentally disturbed person who ignores medical advice and ceases to take prescribed medication. The possibility (it can be put no higher) that some of the damage to Mr Uren's eye arose from the intervention of the good Samaritan does not lessen the objective seriousness of the offence, because intervention by a bystander is part of the ordinary and predictable range of consequences that might follow when someone is injured (cf Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112 ). Overall, I would assess the objective seriousness of the offence as lying about the midrange. 

90The table of standard non-parole periods applies directly only to sentences imposed after a trial: R v Way at [68]-[69]. However, s 54B(2) has the effect that, even for offences concerning which there is a plea, the court can depart from the standard non-parole period only if the court gives reasons were so doing. That does not mean that the standard non-parole period must be the starting point of the court's reasoning on sentence, just that, by the end of the court's reasoning on sentencing, it must be clear why the judge has departed from the standard non-parole period, if he or she has done so. The permissible reasons, under s 54B(3), are only those referred to in s 21A, but the list of mitigating factors in s 21A(3) includes, in (k), that the offender has pleaded guilty. Thus the fact that there has been a plea can itself be a reason for imposing a non-parole period that is less than the standard non-parole period. 

91In the present case, if a 25% discount for the Applicant's plea is allowed from the standard non-parole period, and no other adjustment is made, a non-parole period of 3 years results. That in itself is ground for believing that the non-parole period that the judge imposed (less than a month short of 3 years) is too long. 

92I would agree with all of the mitigating factors that the judge found ([81] above), and with all the reasons why she found special circumstances ([85] above]). For the purposes of re-sentencing, an affidavit of the Applicant and an affidavit of his solicitor were read. The judge's prediction that the Applicant's intellectual impairment will make his time in custody more onerous has proved correct. On 24 September 2010 he asked a fellow inmate how to spell something, and that encounter turned into a fight where the other inmate threatened to stab him. The Applicant has been in protective custody since then, avoids all contact with other inmates, and stays in his cell all the time except when he goes to courses. He does not even talk to people in his courses as he is scared. He has no charges or punishments for inappropriate behaviour. 

93The Applicant's mental condition is such that general deterrence has a significantly reduced role by comparison to that which it would have for a person without the Applicant's disabilities. While there were some reports of violent or aggressive outbursts from the Applicant when he was a child, he has no history of violence as an adult. The only significant role for specific deterrence seems to be as encouragement for him to avoid alcohol. The judge's description of him as functioning ""at a level in society more normal than not"" seems to me to underplay the extent of his disability. His disability is more than the ""mild intellectual impairment"" to which the judge referred in the passage quoted at [52] above. Rather, his mental retardation has been put by Dr Rowe as being mild to moderate, and in addition he has ADD. 

94If it were not for the Applicant's plea, the appropriate sentence, in my view, was a non-parole period of three years, with a balance of term of two years. After giving a full 25% allowance for the plea, the resulting sentences are a non-parole period of 27 months, and the balance of term of 18 months. The appropriate course is to quash the sentences, and re-sentence the Applicant accordingly. 

95In these circumstances there is no occasion to consider the ninth ground of appeal, which contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

96I propose the following orders: 

1. Grant leave to appeal. 

2. Appeal allowed. 

3. Set aside the sentence in the court below. 

4. In lieu thereof, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period commencing on 31 May 2010 and expiring on 30 August 2012, with a balance of term expiring on 28 February 2014. 

97RS HULME J: I agree with Campbell JA. 

98HOEBEN J: I agree with Campbell JA.

		10 June 2011",2011-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757168,Thanh NGUYEN v R [2011] NSWCCA 127,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Hoeben J.  2HOEBEN J:  Offence and sentence  On 23 August 2010 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court at Parramatta for the offence of cultivating not less than a commercial quantity of prohibited plants (168 plants) by enhanced indoor means contrary to s23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  This offence carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 15 years.  No standard non-parole period applied.  3His Honour was asked to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of dealing with electricity without authority contrary to s64(1) of the Electricity Supply Act 1995.  That offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.  4His Honour was also asked to deal with a related offence on a s166 certificate, i.e. being found on drug premises contrary to s36X(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  5The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, commencing 5 November 2009 and expiring 4 May 2012 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring 4 November 2013.  In relation to the s36X(1)(a) offence, his Honour imposed no penalty pursuant to s10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  His Honour did so in the light of the sentence imposed for the major offence.  6The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:  Ground 1 - Sentencing Judge erred in his findings as to the role of the applicant.  Ground 2 - Sentencing Judge erred in:  (a) Determining that the offence was a midrange offence and sentencing on that basis;  (b) Attaching undue weight to the quantity of the plants.  Ground 3 - The sentence was unduly harsh and severe.  Factual Background  7His Honour had before him a statement of agreed facts.  This included extracts from the applicant's ERISP.  The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings.  8On 5 November 2009 the police executed a search warrant in respect of premises in Tangerine Street, Fairfield.  The premises comprised a single storey, brick dwelling bordered by a steel fence with a roller gate.  The fence was locked and the windows to the property were covered by roller shutters.  There was a large shed at the rear of the property.  9Before entering the premises, the police knocked on the front door and shouted out to announce who they were and the purpose of their attendance.  The applicant was observed through the glass of the rear exit door and after some hesitation, opened that door.  He told police that there was no-one else at the premises and when asked if there was anything illegal in the premises he said ""I don't know"".  10When police entered the house they located a set of keys on a table in the lounge-room.  The applicant said that the keys belonged to him.  When he was asked if any of the keys opened the shed door, he replied ""I don't know"".  Police later discovered that the keys fitted the locks to the front door and the shed.  11When police walked through the premises, including the shed, they found a seedling tray containing 32 cannabis plants in one of the bedrooms.  Inside the shed they discovered a sophisticated hydroponic setup spread over two rooms.  A third room contained chemicals, power-boards and transformers.  The cannabis plants located in the two rooms were in various stages of maturity, all growing in pots under lampshades with attached globes.  The pot plants had PVC piping attached for automatic watering.  The police noticed that the plants appeared to have been recently watered.  The police also noticed that a ventilation system had been installed using extraction fans and charcoal filters.  12In one of the rooms the police found Centrelink documents in the name of ""Tony Nguyen"" and prescription medication in the same name.  In the same room in which the seedling tray was found, the police also found a wallet containing identification in the name of ""Thanh Nguyen"" and the passport of Thanh Nguyen.  The police also found two thermometers on the top shelf of the wardrobe where the wallet and passport were found.  The applicant's fingerprints were located on one of those thermometers and on the seedling tray.  A total of 168 cannabis plants were located at Tangerine Street.  13Police located a Residential Tenancy Agreement between The Tong Truong (the owner of the Tangerine Street premises) and the applicant.  The tenancy agreement allowed the applicant to lease the property from 1 May 2008 until 1 April 2010.  When the owner of the property was contacted by police, he confirmed that the applicant had leased the property in 2008.  14Initially the applicant made no admissions but when confronted with the lease agreement said that the lease was signed before he went to Vietnam, that he had resided at Tangerine Street for about two months and then returned to other premises in Marrickville, after which he went to Vietnam and then came back to Tangerine Street.  Investigations showed that the applicant was in Vietnam in September/October 2009.  The applicant denied looking in the wardrobe of the room where the wallet and the seedling tray were located.  He told the police that he was also known as ""Tony Nguyen"".  15When an employee of Integral Energy attended the premises at Tangerine Street and observed the illegal electrical connections, he estimated that the electricity used but not paid for was in the vicinity of $19,000.  16In his ERISP the applicant said that he had only moved into the house five days before the police executed the search warrant.  17The applicant pleaded guilty to the principal offence in the Local Court and his Honour accepted that the plea had been entered at the earliest opportunity.  Remarks on sentence  18Because of the early plea of guilty, his Honour reduced the sentence by 25 percent to reflect the utility of the plea.  His Honour noted that he needed to take into account the Form 1 offence when considering deterrence and retribution.  19Because of the applicant's evasiveness when questioned by the police, his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant had acknowledged the harm of the offence and was not persuaded that the applicant was genuinely remorseful.  20Apart from the applicant's criminal history, there was no evidence before the Court about his subjective background.  Further information was only provided by way of submissions from the bar table.  21In relation to the applicant's subjective case, he was born in Vietnam and was aged 36 at the time of sentencing.  He had two brothers living in Sydney.  He himself first came to Australia as a tourist in 1991 and later married in Australia in 1994.  The marriage ended about three years later.  More recently he married again while in Vietnam in 2009 and his wife remained in that country.  22He completed the equivalent of year 11, leaving school at the age of 16.  In Australia he worked at a number of unskilled jobs, but was in receipt of Centrelink benefits at the time of his arrest.  There was no evidence that he suffered from any mental health issues or intellectual disability.  23Because of his prior criminal record, which included dishonesty and traffic offences, together with three offences for the possession of drugs in 1998, 2000 and 2002, his Honour was not prepared to regard him as a person of prior good character.  24At the time of sentencing the applicant was taking methadone.  He had hepatitis C and was taking medication to treat this.  25In relation to the offence, his Honour noted that the number of plants involved was over three times the commercial quantity which was 50 plants and was approximately 84 percent of a large commercial quantity.  His Honour inferred from the varying sizes of the plants that this was an ongoing venture.  His Honour noted that the estimate by the police as to the street value of the cannabis was in excess of $500,000.  26Apart from the plea of guilty, his Honour found that the applicant was living at the house at the time of his arrest.  Having regard to his presence in the house, his possession of the keys, his being the tenant, his fingerprint on the thermostat found in the wardrobe near the seedlings and his fingerprint on the seedling tray, his Honour concluded that the applicant was actively involved in the offence.  27His Honour noted that there was no evidence, other than what the applicant said in the ERISP, to support the proposition that he was not living at the house of which he was the tenant.  His Honour concluded that as the tenant, he must have played some part in setting up the property for the cultivation or had permitted others to do so.  28His Honour concluded ""Whilst the evidence does not permit the Court to determine the exact nature of or extent of his role in the plantation"", the circumstances satisfied him beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant was a major player in the cultivation and not just a labourer or worker.  29In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, his Honour concluded that greed motivated the applicant's involvement in the project.  His Honour concluded that the offence was premeditated and that the applicant must have appreciated that by becoming involved in it, he had enmeshed himself in organised criminal activity.  His Honour assessed the offence ""as a midrange offence"".  30In the absence of any evidence, his Honour found it almost impossible to make a reliable determination of the applicant's rehabilitation prospects and the prospects of him not re-offending.  Somewhat generously, his Honour found that those prospects were ""reasonable"".  Appeal  Ground 1 - Sentencing Judge erred in his findings as to the role of the applicant.  31The applicant submitted that it was not open to his Honour to find that the applicant was ""a major player in the cultivation and not just a labourer or worker"" and that ""as a tenant he must have played some role in setting up the property for cultivation or had permitted others to do so"".  In that regard the applicant noted that the charge to which he had pleaded guilty was only with respect to cultivation on 5 November 2009 when the police found him on the premises.  The applicant referred to what he had told the police in his statement about not being present on the property very often.  32The evidence before his Honour was mostly circumstantial.  Little reliance could be placed on what the applicant said in his ERISP since to the extent that those assertions could be checked, they were found to be false.  It was well open to his Honour to treat the denials by the applicant in that statement with scepticism.  33What the applicant's submissions fail to have regard to is the legal effect of him being the tenant.  As such he had the immediate right to possession of the premises.  Anyone using the premises would as a matter of law, have required his permission.  It was also not without significance that the lease period commenced 1 May 2008.  34The indoor cultivation system which the police discovered was a sophisticated one.  Significantly the police found that the plants had been recently watered and when they arrived the only person present on the premises was the applicant.  It was well open to his Honour to find that the applicant had permitted other persons to set up the property for cultivation if he himself had not set it up.  35His Honour's finding that the applicant ""was a major player"" needs to be looked in the context of the whole statement.  In reaching that conclusion, his Honour contrasted the position of the applicant with that of ""just a labourer or worker"".  Once again such a finding was well open to his Honour given the applicant's position as the tenant and because his personal documents were found in two rooms in the house.  Importantly, his passport and wallet were found in the same room as the tray of 32 cannabis seedlings which were being grown under fluorescent lights.  The fact that his fingerprints were found on one of the thermometers and on the seedling tray, allowed an inference to be drawn that he played an active part in the illegal enterprise.  36Although the charge referred only to the date of 5 November 2009, it was open to his Honour to find that this was an ongoing operation.  He was able to do so on the basis of the sophisticated setup in all the rooms of the house and in the shed.  He could also have regard to the number of plants and the fact that they were at various stages of maturity and included seedlings.  The fact that his Honour also found that others must have been involved at some stage in the illegal enterprise, did not exclude the applicant from being a major player.  On all the evidence it was open to his Honour to make such a finding.  Ground 2 - The Sentencing Judge erred in:  (a) Determining that the offence was a midrange offence and sentencing on that basis;  (b) Attaching undue weight to the quantity of the plants.  37The applicant submitted that when his Honour said ""In the Court's view this offence is a midrange offence"" his Honour erred.  It was submitted that such language was only appropriate for offences which involved a standard non-parole period.  It was submitted that to make such a finding would inevitably involve the sentencing judge in a ""two step"" approach to sentencing by dividing the ""instinctive synthesis into a decision on the objective seriousness of the offence followed by a consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender"".  38The applicant clearly had in mind the observations of Howie AJ in Georgopolous v R [2010] NSWCCA 246 at [32] where his Honour said:  ""32 Further, it seems to me that the course adopted by the Conlon DCJ leads to a ""two-step"" approach to sentencing by dividing the ""instinctive synthesis"" into a decision on the objective seriousness of the offence followed by a consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender: cf Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [35] to [39]. In a case where a standard non-parole period applies the court is forced by the terms of the legislation to engage in a stepped approach to sentencing involving, as the first step, a consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence followed then by a consideration of the matters in s 21A: see MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93. But where that legislation does not apply, a court should avoid embarking upon an independent and detailed analysis of objective seriousness.""  39That observation by Howie AJ needs to be read with what his Honour said at [30] in the same case.  There his Honour said:  ""30 Because the offence did not carry a standard non-parole period, it was unnecessary for his Honour to embark upon a detailed finding as to where the offence lay in relation to a mid range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type. It is likely to lead to confusion and misinterpretation when the offence does not carry a standard non-parole period.""  40Taking those two paragraphs together does not lead to a conclusion that his Honour was going so far as to say that it was erroneous to express an opinion as to the seriousness or otherwise of an offence.  What his Honour was saying was that it was unnecessary and involved a risk of offending the principles set out in Markarian .  41The distinction which Howie AJ was seeking to draw in Georgopolous is best set out by McClellan CJ at CL in Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 where his Honour contrasted the two modes of expression whereby a sentencing judge may indicate the seriousness of an offence or offences under consideration.  ""2 The sentencing judge described the offence as lying in the mid range of ""objective seriousness"" but toward the lower end of that range.  In so doing the language used by her Honour was that which is appropriate when sentencing for an offence which attracts a sentence which includes a standard non-parole period.  The present offence does not attract a standard non-parole period.  3 Although a sentencing judge must always identify the seriousness of the offence, caution should be exercised when using language relevant to an offence which attracts a standard non-parole period. The relevant principles were discussed by this Court in R v Way (2004) NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168: see also R v AJP (2004) NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575.  4 When assessing where an offence lies in the range of objective seriousness when the offence attracts a standard non-parole period it is important to put aside considerations that do not have a nexus with its commission: Way [99].  Identifying whether an offence falls within the mid range of objective seriousness or otherwise is necessary so that appropriate consideration can be given to the standard non-parole period provided by the statute.  The ""objective seriousness"" of the offence is of relevance only to the non-parole period to be imposed.  5 The ""objective seriousness"" of an offence is a different concept to the ""seriousness of the offence"", the latter expression being commonly used when determining the sentence, both total term and non-parole period (if appropriate) for that offence.  Where a standard non-parole period is not provided for an offence, the objective seriousness of the offence does not, of itself, direct attention to any particular type of punishment or term of imprisonment which must both be determined after all of the relevant matters, both objective and subjective, which inform the seriousness of the offence have been considered.""  42It is significant that the expression used by his Honour on this occasion was not couched in the terminology of standard non-parole periods.  His Honour simply observed (correctly in my opinion) that this was a midrange offence.  His Honour expressed this opinion after having analysed the objective and subjective features of the offence and was clearly assessing the ""seriousness of the offence"" as described by McClellan CJ at CL in [5] of Sivell as set out.  43Taking into account the circumstances of the offence, together with the applicant's extraordinarily weak subjective case, it was well open to his Honour to make such an assessment.  No error has been made out.  44In relation to the quantity of plants, his Honour did no more than to have regard as part of his overall assessment of the seriousness of the offence, to the number of plants and their stage of development.  This was a relevant circumstance to be taken into account by his Honour.  In context, however, it was simply one factor out of many which his Honour took into account in reaching his assessment as to the overall seriousness of the offence.  Ground 3 - The sentence was unduly harsh and severe.  45In support of this submission, the applicant relied upon a schedule of what was described as ""comparative cases"" from both the District Court and this Court to illustrate that this sentence was a heavy sentence, towards the top of the range.  46An examination of the cases to which the Court was referred would lead one to the conclusion that the sentence imposed by his Honour was towards the upper end of the range, if one took as the only determinant of the range, the 33 cases which were summarized on the schedule.  47An initial difficulty with the approach of the applicant is that when assessing the proper sentencing range, an important consideration is the maximum sentence for the offence.  In this case that was imprisonment for 15 years.  The applicant's submissions paid no regard to that important start point.  48The other difficulty is that, of their very nature, statistics even where particular aspects have been extracted and included on a schedule such as was before the Court, only provide a partial picture of the facts of the case.  There is little or no information about the accused's subjective case nor is there a full statement of the important facts of the case,.  With particular relevance to this case, there is no indication of whether any Form 1 matters were taken into account.  49When assessing whether a sentence is manifestly excessive, the test remains as set out by Garling J in Fogg v R [2011] NSWCCA 1 at [59] - [60]:  ""59 ... but for many offences culpability varies over so wide a range that the statistics are of limited utility for a particular case ...  60 ... I accept that the statistics referred to demonstrate that the sentence in this case falls at the high end of the range of sentences imposed for the offence.  But the question remains whether it falls within the range of the permissible exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.""  50As this Court has said on a number of occasions, undue weight should not be given to sentencing statistics.  This is because of the ""vast range of factors relevant to sentencing for such an offence""  (RA Hulme J in Furia v R [2010] NSWCCA 326).  The large number of variables is simply not reflected in mere statistical figures and percentages.  51What is important when considering a particular sentence are the specific findings as to the seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender.  These are the considerations which are determinative when assessing whether a particular sentence is manifestly excessive, rather than a comparison of the sentence with statistics ( Holloway v R [2011] NSWCCA 23 at [85]).  The critical question is whether the sentence imposed was appropriate for the particular case ( R v F (2002) 132 A Crim R 308, adopted in Ayoub, Omran v R; El Masri, Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 196 at [58]).  52Important matters which his Honour took into account in this case were the part played by the applicant in the commission of the offence, and the seriousness of the offence taking into account its factual background and the absence of any kind of compelling subjective case.  These are important matters which were given appropriate weight by his Honour.  Finally, his Honour had to give some effect to the Form 1 offence ( Attorney General's Application under s37 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 [2002] NSWCCA 518, (2002) 56 NSWLR 146).  53Even on the schedule of cases provided to the Court in support of this submission, it is clear that the sentence passed by his Honour was not only open to him but was within the range of sentences for offences of this kind.  54Error of the kind asserted has not been made out.  Conclusion  55The orders which I propose are as follows:  (i) Leave to appeal be granted.  (ii) That the appeal be dismissed.  56GROVE AJ:  I agree with Hoeben J.  **********

		16 June 2011",2011-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757169,JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  I agree with Hoeben J.  2HOEBEN J:  Offences and sentence  On 23 March 2009 the applicant pleaded guilty at Cobham Children's Court to an offence of robbery with infliction of grievous bodily harm, contrary to s96 of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 25 years.  The offence occurred on 26 July 2008.  3The applicant was 16 years and 7 months old at the time of the offence.  Accordingly the s96 offence fell within the definition of a ""serious children's indictable offence"" under s3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.  The applicant was therefore committed for sentence to the District Court to be dealt with according to law.  4The sentence proceedings were conducted on 26 August 2009 before Syme DCJ.  Her Honour passed sentence on 9 September 2009.  The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months commencing 1 August 2009 and expiring 30 September 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years and 10 months expiring 31 July 2015.  5The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence passed by her Honour on the following grounds:  Ground 1 - The trial judge erred in failing to take into account the appellant's time in custody and to properly consider the issue of totality.  Ground 2 - The trial judge erred by taking into account ""planning as an aggravating factor"".  Ground 3 - In all the circumstances, particularly taking into account the age of the applicant, the sentence was manifestly excessive.  Factual background  6At about 10pm on Saturday 26 July the victim JV, who was aged 14, and his brother J, aged 11, were returning home from watching a rugby league match featuring the Penrith team.  As they did so, a car pulled up and the applicant and another offender approached the victim.  They said ""Give me your money"" to which the victim replied ""I don't have any"".  The applicant and the co-offender then punched and kicked the victim repeatedly, as well as stomping on his head.  As a result of the assault, the victim suffered a deep 10 cms wound to the right side of his head and other severe lacerations and swelling over his entire facial area.  During the attack the victim curled up in an attempt to protect himself without success.  The attack rendered the victim unconscious.  The applicant and the co-offender took the victim's jacket, his white running shoes and his wristwatch while he was unconscious.  The applicant and his co-offender then returned to the motor vehicle which left the area.  7By way of further background, the applicant was taken into custody on 2 August 2008 in relation to other offences.  These offences included two counts of affray, two counts of assault police officer and counts of resist or hinder police and hinder apprehension of a person who committed a serious offence, destroy or damage property, common assault and escape police custody.  Control orders were imposed on 26 May 2009 in respect of all of those offences, the latest in time expiring on 1 August 2009.  8On 15 June 2009 the applicant received two further control orders in respect of one count of larceny and one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company.  Those control orders were entirely concurrent with the orders imposed on 26 May 2009 as to the period of detention.    The applicant was charged with the offence, the subject of this application, on 6 August 2008.  9Since sentence was passed for this offence, the applicant has been convicted and sentenced while in custody for an offence of assaulting a Corrective Services officer and occasioning actual bodily harm.  On 29 November 2010 he was sentenced for that offence to imprisonment for 16 months with a non-parole period of 12 months to expire 29 September 2013 and a balance of term of 4 months to expire on 29 January 2014.  Remarks on sentence  10Having reviewed the facts, her Honour allowed a 25 percent discount to the applicant because of the utilitarian value of his early plea of guilty.  Her Honour declined to backdate the commencement of the sentence to 1 December 2008 because ""to do so would nullify the effect of the prior sentences"".  Her Honour went on to say:  ""Counsel has referred to the principle of totality, however I am sentencing the offender only in relation to this single offence.""  (ROS 3.9)  Consequently, her Honour was only prepared to backdate the commencement of the sentence to 1 August 2009.  11Her Honour found aggravating features to be that the offence was committed in company and that the applicant was on several good  behaviour bonds from the Children's Court at the time of the offence.  Her Honour noted that the applicant had been convicted of a similar robbery matter in the Children's Court in March 2007.  While her Honour did not take that into account as an aggravating circumstance, she noted it would disentitle the applicant to considerations of leniency.  12Her Honour took into account as an aggravating feature that the victim was a 14 year old child and therefore vulnerable to this kind of offence.  Her Honour noted that although violence was an element of this offence, in assessing its seriousness she would have regard to the fact that the violence was sustained and substantial.  13Her Honour took into account as an aggravating feature the fact that the offence was planned.  Her Honour said:  ""While this is planning to a limited degree and the choice of victim appears to have been totally random, this is an aggravating circumstance to that limited degree.""  (ROS 4.3)  14Her Honour had regard to the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. By reference to Henry her Honour noted that while the applicant was young, unlike the offender in Henry he had a very significant criminal history.  In Henry there was limited, if any, actual violence whereas in this case significant violence was inflicted on the victim.  Unlike the victim in Henry , the victim here was vulnerable.  Her Honour also noted that in Henry the offence was contrary to s97 of the Crimes Act which imposed a lesser maximum penalty.  15Her Honour took into account the provisions of s6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 . Relevantly, her Honour made reference to the following subsections:  ""6(b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,  ...  (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind,  (f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties,  (g)  that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions,  (h) that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim.""  16Her Honour took into account that general deterrence was of less significance when sentencing a young offender.  17In relation to the applicant's subjective case, her Honour noted the following factors.   The applicant was born in 1991.  He was aged 16 years and 7 months at the time of the offence.  He was due to turn 18 in December 2009.  He was of Samoan descent and came to Australia with his family when he was aged 5.  His father has been in custody for violence related offences and physical punishment was common at home.  His mother and his family were supportive of him.  18As a result of his behaviour at school, the applicant was frequently suspended from year 7 onwards.  He was completing year 10 while in custody.  He had not engaged in any employment.  19The applicant commenced using alcohol and cannabis from the age of 12 and at the time of his offending, was regularly abusing those substances.  He had never undergone any rehabilitation.  20A psychologist's report identified the applicant has having longstanding anger and tolerance issues.  Her Honour noted that while the psychologist identified options such as anger management counselling, drug and alcohol counselling and violent offender programs which were available to the applicant, all of them required his co-operation if they were to be useful.  The applicant scored poorly on IQ tests.  The psychologist concluded that his poor verbal and reasoning skills were associated with his impulsivity and accordingly, constituted a risk of re-offending.  The psychologist thought that his prospects for rehabilitation were dim.  Her Honour accepted that the applicant would require substantial and sustained supervision once he was released.  21Her Honour concluded her remarks as follows:  ""This offence for the reasons given is above midrange of seriousness for an offence of this nature.  Having regard to the assessment of this offence as higher than midrange, taking into account the s21A factors that I have referred to including the mitigating circumstances, there are reasons and there will be reasons for altering the standard non-parole period ratio, those reasons will be the age of the offender and the demonstrated need for continued and long term supervision.""   (ROS 11.5)  22Her Honour directed that the applicant remain in a Juvenile Detention Centre rather than an adult prison after he turned 18.  Appeal  Ground 1 - The trial judge erred in failing to take into account the applicant's time in custody and to properly consider the issue of totality.  23The applicant relied upon s24(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides that when sentencing an offender the Court must take into account any time for which an offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence.  That having been said, the applicant accepted that because the other offences were committed at different times and involved different victims, it was within the discretion of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that was cumulative on that passed for the other offences.  24The thrust of the applicant's submissions was that her Honour erred when she said that the principle of totality did not apply because she was only sentencing the offender in respect of the robbery offence.  In saying that she could not consider totality in that context, her Honour was clearly in error.  She could have, if she regarded it as appropriate, considered not only the sentence which she was passing but the other sentences which he was serving so as to ensure that the principles of totality and proportionality were observed.  25However, her Honour was not obliged to do so.  Earlier in her Remarks on Sentence, her Honour declined to backdate the commencement of the sentence for this offence to 1 December 2008 because to do so would nullify the effect of the prior sentences.  This was an entirely proper basis for her Honour declining to backdate the commencement of the sentence more than she did.  To have acceded to this application would have meant that the applicant spent only four months in custody for the very serious instances of offending for which those sentences were passed (see [7] - [8] hereof).  26Looked at from that point of view, the fact that her Honour substantially accumulated the sentence she passed on the earlier control orders did not offend the principles of totality and proportionality.  On the contrary, such a level of accumulation was proportionate to the serious offending which had led to the imposition of control orders up to 1 August 2009 and also had adequate regard to the serious offence for which the applicant was then being sentenced by her Honour.  27This ground of appeal has not been made out.  Ground 2 - The trial judge erred by taking into account ""planning as an aggravating factor"".  28Her Honour clearly erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor the limited planning which she identified as being present in this offence.  In Knight v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 51 James J said:  '16 Section 21A(2)(n) has been the subject of interpretation by this Court.  See for example R v Yildiz (2006) 160 A Crim R 218; Fahs v R [2007] NSWCCA 26; Hewitt v R (2007) 180 A Crim R 306.  It has been consistently held by this Court that a sentencing judge should not find that the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(n) was present, unless there is evidence that would permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the degree of planning in the instant case exceeded the degree of planning which would ordinarily be expected in an offence of that kind.""  29Although her Honour erred in the manner specified, it is clear from her Honour's mode of expression that she gave very little weight to this factor.  Having characterized the planning as being ""to a limited degree"" her Honour's conclusion was ""this is an aggravating circumstance to that limited degree"".  30Although error has been identified, it is clear that this error had only a minimal effect on the sentence which her Honour passed.  Ground 3 - In all the circumstances, particularly taking into account the age of the applicant, the sentence was manifestly excessive.  31The applicant submitted that when one allowed for the 25 percent discount, her Honour's start point for the sentence must have been 8 years.  The applicant submitted that such a start point was manifestly excessive when one had regard to the applicant's age and personal circumstances.  32The applicant submitted that although her Honour purported to take into account the applicant's age in her Remarks on Sentence, she in fact did not do so.  The applicant submitted that this was the very type of offence, involving as it did impulsivity and opportunism, which was significantly contributed to the applicant's youth.  33In support of that proposition, the applicant relied upon the following extract from KT v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 51 where McClellan CJ at CL set out the principles applicable when sentencing young offenders:  ""22 The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society's norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation.  ...  23 The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender's youth and not just their biological age. ... The weight to be given to the fact of the offender's youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence. ...  Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult. ...  24 Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct. ...  25 The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity.  ... In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ""adult behaviour""... the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence.  ... Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society.""  34I am not persuaded that this is the sort of offence which indicates impulsivity and immaturity on the part of the applicant so that the need for rehabilitation should be given paramount consideration.  Rather, this is the very sort of offence that McClellan CJ at CL had in mind when qualifying his initial statement of principle in paras [24] and [25] of KT v Regina .  35This is the sort of case where general deterrence and retribution cannot be ignored.  The bashing of a 14 year old child into insensibility during the course of a prolonged attack by two significantly older youths is very much the sort of crime of violence and considerable gravity which his Honour had in mind.  The existence in this case of an extensive criminal history, the nature and circumstances of the offence and the applicant's obduracy in continuing to commit offences of considerable violence meant that rehabilitation did not have the force which it would normally have when sentencing a juvenile.  36Similar observations were made by Dunford J in R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92 where his Honour said:  ""28 ... There comes a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a young offender, particularly if a crime of violence, is so great that the special attention normally given to rehabilitation in the case of young offenders must give way, and greater emphasis given to punishment and deterrence.  The relevant principle was summarised in the joint judgment of this Court in R v AEM Snr and Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97] -  [98] as follows:  ""It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation.... However, important as that principle is, it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment nor, in circumstances where young offenders conduct themselves in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society.""""  37In R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R, Lee CJ at CL said at p 135:  ""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison unless that course is necessary.  But the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal courts' function will cease to operate.  In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes.""  38Contrary to the applicant's submissions, her Honour did take into account all relevant principles.  She took into account the requirements of s6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and to the extent that it was applicable, the guideline judgment in Henry. In that regard Henry has been held to apply to the sentencing of juveniles ( R v SDM [2001] NSWCCA 158).  39The approach followed by her Honour was consistent with the observations of this Court in R v McHarg [2011] NSWCCA 115 where Johnson J (with whom Whealy JA and Hidden J) agreed) said:  ""146 ... It was important that the objective seriousness of his offences not be overshadowed by his youth and the undoubted desire to take steps to foster his rehabilitation. It remained necessary as well to have regard to issues of personal and general deterrence. In relation to crimes of violence committed on the streets by groups of young persons, consideration of general deterrence should be given substantial weight, notwithstanding the youth of the offenders: AI v R [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [69].  147 Given the Respondent's past history of committing offences despite non-custodial sentencing orders in the Children's Court, and his commission of these offences whilst subject to conditional liberty by way of bonds or bail (or both), specific deterrence remained a significant factor on sentence. ""  40Her Honour's sentence involved an appropriate balance of the principles referred to in the above cases and no error, either in her Honour's approach or in her Honour's sentence has been made out.  Conclusion  41The orders which I propose are:  (1) That leave to appeal be granted.  (2) That the appeal be dismissed.  42GROVE AJ:    I agree with Hoeben J.  **********

2757170,BELLCHAMBERS v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 131,"Judgment  1CAMPBELL JA:  I agree with Hoeben J.  2RS HULME J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben J and with his Honour's reasons.  3HOEBEN J:  Offence and sentence  The applicant pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900.  This offence has as its maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  4The dates of the offences were 14 October 2006, 20 May 2008, 26 January 2010 and 30 January 2010.  All four offences involved the same victim.  5The matter came before Black DCJ in the District Court at Lismore for sentence on 16 June 2010.  His Honour imposed the following sentences:  Count 1: Imprisonment for 4 years commencing 6 February 2010 expiring 5 February 2014.  Count 2: Imprisonment for 5 years commencing 6 February 2011 and expiring 5 February 2016.  Count 3: Imprisonment for 7 years commencing 6 February 2013 and expiring 5 February 2020 with a non-parole period of 4  years expiring 5 August 2017.  Count 4: Imprisonment for 7 years commencing 6 February 2013 and expiring 5 February 2020 with a non-parole period of 4  years expiring 5 August 2017.  The overall sentence was imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 7  years.  His Honour declined to find special circumstances.  6The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:  Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to impose a non-parole period for the first two counts.  Ground 2: His Honour failed to determine the objective seriousness of the offences.  Ground 3: His Honour did not properly assess the totality of the criminal offending by determining the individual sentences and then assessing the totality, but rather did the reverse.  Ground 4: His Honour erred in not finding special circumstances.  Ground 5: The individual sentences and the total sentence are too severe.  His Honour erred in determining the length of the sentences given the plea of guilty and the objective seriousness of the offences.  Factual Background  7Two sets of facts were placed before the Court.  The first dealing with counts 1 and 2 and the second dealing with counts 3 and 4.  While it is clear that his Honour had that material before him, he did not refer to it in his remarks on sentence.  8The complainant and the applicant entered into a relationship in about September 2005.  At that time the complainant had a three year old daughter from a previous relationship.  The complainant became pregnant to the applicant in April 2006.  9By the end of July 2006 the relationship had begun to break down.  On occasions the complainant was reluctant to have sexual intercourse, but the applicant persisted in his requests.  10On 14 October 2006 the applicant and the complainant had returned to the complainant's flat after a day at the beach.  Whilst the complainant was in her bedroom, the applicant began asking her to have sex with him.  She told him that she did not want to.  Although she asked him to stop, the applicant pushed her face first onto the bed.  He removed her underpants and sexual intercourse took place.  The complainant did not say or do anything further.  The applicant then left the flat.  These were the facts surrounding count 1.  11The complainant gave birth to their son on 25 January 2007.  Until 20 October 2008 the complainant allowed the applicant access to the child.  During this time the relationship between the applicant and the complainant continued on an intermittent basis.  On occasions the complainant did not want to have sexual intercourse with the applicant but he persisted.  12On 20 May 2008 at the complainant's request, the applicant attended the complainant's flat to collect a pizza which she had cooked.  He brought a DVD with him.  Soon after the DVD commenced, the applicant began touching the complainant.  13The complainant said that she did not want to have sex.  Despite her refusal, the applicant pushed her onto the floor and placed his hand inside her pants.  The complainant got up and ran to the hall and the applicant pursued her.  He pushed her into her bedroom and face down onto the bed.  The complainant had been struggling but she gave up.  Sexual intercourse then took place. When the applicant finished, he left the complainant's flat.  These were the facts surrounding count 2.  14On 21 May 2008 the complainant told her general practitioner what had happened.  She spoke to a sexual assault counsellor.  She was examined by a doctor at Lismore Base Hospital.  She then attended Lismore Police Station and informed officers of the offences.  The applicant attended Byron Bay Police Station on 14 October 2008 and was charged with counts 1 and 2.  15Despite the applicant being charged with these offences, a sexual relationship appears to have continued between him and the complainant.  In early September 2009 the complainant met with the applicant so that he could spend time with their son.  After spending the day together the applicant said to the complainant ""Can I come to the house and stay with W?""  The complainant agreed to let him stay at her home.  On 27 September 2009 the complainant discovered that she was pregnant with the applicant's child.  The complainant said that by that time she felt completely downtrodden and she wanted someone to keep the applicant away from her.  On occasions the applicant would refuse to leave the complainant's house when she asked him.  16On 26 November 2009 the complainant told the police at the Lismore Police Station that the applicant had been attending her home and as a result was in breach of the bail conditions imposed in relation to counts 1 and 2.  After making that report the complainant did not see the applicant again for some time.  17On 19 January 2010 the complainant and the applicant accidentally met while shopping in Byron Bay.  On that occasion the applicant asked the complainant if she would come to the beach with him on 25 January, which was their son's birthday.  Nothing seems to have come of that request.  At about 11.30pm on 25 January 2010 the applicant rang the complainant and said that he wished to speak to her face to face.  The complainant reluctantly agreed but said that they would have to talk outside the house.  An argument ensued, which woke up their son, and the applicant entered the house to play with the child.  18At about 3am on 26 January 2010 the complainant was standing near her bedroom door, having got the child back to sleep.  The applicant grabbed her and pushed her against the doorway and started to kiss her and touch her.  The complainant kept turning her face away and said ""Stop.  We can't do this.  I don't want to do this.  Please don't do this.""  The applicant held the complainant down.  The complainant attempted to push him off but she was not strong enough.  Sexual intercourse then took place with the complainant saying ""I don't want to do this"".  The applicant ignored the complainant and continued to engage in penile intercourse.  19When he was finished the applicant said ""Are you going to have me charged with sexual assault?"" The complainant said ""No"".  The applicant got off the bed and walked into the child's room.  Later he told the complainant that if she reported him to the police he would kill himself.  He then left.  These were the facts surrounding count 3.  20The complainant subsequently rang the applicant and told him that because he had raped her, she did not want to talk to him anymore and that she did not want him to see their son again.  21On 29 January 2010 the applicant arrived at the complainant's flat and they spoke.  During the conversation the applicant said ""You think you've been frightened of me before.  Now's the time to be really scared.  If there was ever a time I was going to snap and do something bad now is that time"".  The applicant further threatened to kill himself if she did not let him stay at her home.  He eventually fell asleep.  22On 30 January 2010 the applicant was at the complainant's home and their son was outside playing.  The complainant was in her bedroom and the applicant came in and grabbed her.  She said ""Let me go"".  The applicant pushed her back onto the bed and pulled her underwear off.  The applicant positioned himself between her legs and had non-consensual intercourse with her.  When the applicant was finished, he got up and went outside to their son.  These were the facts surrounding count 4.  23On 29 March 2010 the applicant was arrested for counts 3 and 4.  24In the applicant's case, a report was tendered from Mr Stoker, psychologist.  Mr Stoker reported that the applicant had had issues concerning his relationship with his mother.  He had been rejected at an early age by her and had been raised by his maternal grandmother, despite the objections of his maternal grandfather.  The applicant had suffered from chronic depression for most of his life.  Mr Stoker reported as follows:  ""His depression has been severe and he has had extensive psychiatric treatment for his condition.  His depression, in my opinion, is related to a dysfunctional relationship with his mother in which he was given mixed messages and was not loved unconditionally.  His anger that is now directed at himself was triggered, in my opinion, by this relationship.  He has been suicidal at times.  ...  At the time of his offending behaviour he had been in a relationship which was ambivalent.  Their relationship was ""on and off"" and the status of the interaction was confusing.  It is my opinion that his offending can be seen as a result of a severe depression and an ambivalent relationship.""  25A report from Dr Johns, consultant psychiatrist, was also tendered on behalf of the applicant.  Dr Johns reported that the applicant had first come to see him in December 1998.  He was suffering from an established major depressive disorder at the time.  Dr Johns continued to treat the applicant for that condition over the years.  Dr Johns noted that the applicant was eventually granted a disability support pension because of his chronic psychiatric condition.  In relation to the applicant's offending, Dr Johns reported:  ""As I see the situation, the alleged offences referred to in your letter have arisen in the context of an ambivalent relationship between two people who have the common bond of having a son together.  Mr Bellchambers appeared to be extremely distressed that what he had done had resulted in such serious charges being laid against him.  It is true that Mr Bellchambers had been under a lot of stress in respect of the uncertainty of the relationship with the mother of his son, as well as being denied access to his son, which is an expected reaction to such a situation.""  Remarks on sentence  26As indicated, his Honour did not review the facts of the case but went directly to the question of the objective seriousness of the offence.  In that regard, his Honour noted as a significant aggravating factor that counts 3 and 4 had been committed after the applicant had been committed for sentence in respect of counts 1 and 2.  In relation to objective seriousness, his Honour said:  ""As far as the first two matters are concerned, that is the October 2006 and May 2008, acknowledging as I do that they were totally unacceptable and horrific to the complainant, assessing them as best I can overall I would not regard them as being of the mid-range of seriousness and that is because of the circumstances surrounding them, the nature of the activity and I make that finding.  As far as counts 3 and 4 are concerned, the fact that he was on conditional liberty in respect of precisely the same offence against the same complainant in my view at the very least takes it into the mid-range of gravity and the overbearing of the complainant reflects that and that is what happened in my view.  I have to go through that exercise and that is all I say about the objective seriousness of the situation.""   (ROS 2.9 - 3.3)  27In relation to the applicant's subjective case, his Honour noted that there was before him a large amount of material from many people in the community who indicated that they had a high regard for the applicant.  In that regard, his Honour was prepared to find ""He has done good things for needy people and I bear that in mind"".  His Honour referred to the existence of medical evidence but did not summarise it or otherwise appear to take it into account.  In relation to the subjective case generally, his Honour said:  ""I should first recite the subjective factors in his favour, that is the plea of guilty, no significant record, contrition I find it hard to accept because of counts 3 and 4.""  (ROS 3.9)  28His Honour declined to find special circumstances, even though this was the applicant's first time in custody and there was evidence that he would benefit from longer supervision.  29Before passing sentence, his Honour said:  ""Assessing this overall, I have to look at the individual offences which is why I have gone through that exercise about their overall objective seriousness.  I have to look at the dates and the period involved.  I then have to assess appropriate sentences for each offence and then bearing the principles of Pearce in mind, decide upon any appropriate degree of accumulation and, if so, to what extent and then, having gone through all that, make sure that full credit has been given for appropriate mitigating factors before arriving at the head sentence.  Had it not been for the pleas in this case, I would have regarded the appropriate overall sentence here to have been of 14 years the minimum.  I reduce that because of the pleas to one of 10 years and this is the overall sentence.""  (ROS 4.4)  Appeal  Ground of Appeal 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred by failing to impose a non-parole period for the first two counts.  30The Crown concedes that his Honour erred by failing to comply with s45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  Because that Act provides a standard non-parole period for those offences, the Court was required to set a non-parole period ( SGJ v R ; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76] - [78]; KC v R [2009] NSWCCA 110 at [20]).  While accepting that the error must be corrected, the Crown submitted that the error was technical and did not necessarily operate to the disadvantage of the applicant.  31The applicant will have to be re-sentenced on counts 1 and 2.  Ground of Appeal 2 - His Honour failed to determine the objective seriousness of the offences.  32The applicant submitted that his Honour fell into the error identified in R v Knight, R v Bubiuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283 where McClellan CJ at CL said:  ""4 Where a sentencing judge contemplates imposing a sentence which is significantly less than the standard non-parole period it is prudent for the judge to closely examine the relevant findings before finally determining whether the proposed sentence is appropriate.  Of particular significance will be the finding in relation to the objective seriousness of the offending.  That finding must be carefully considered and appropriately described.  A finding of ""at least mid-range"" suggests that the sentencing judge is of the view that the offence is above the mid-range.  If that is the case, the finding should make this apparent and define the extent to which it falls above the mid-range.  The sentence should appropriately reflect this finding.""  33In the same case, Howie J said:  ""39 The judge described the objective seriousness of the offence committed by Ms Knight as ""at least in the mid-range of objective seriousness"".  The Crown on this appeal conceded that ""her Honour correctly assessed the objective seriousness of the offending"".  With respect to both the Judge and the Crown Prosecutor, it is impossible to understand how such an assessment fulfils the obligation on a trial judge in applying the standard non-parole provisions to assess the objective seriousness of the offence committed.  Presumably the judge thought that the offence was somewhere above mid-range but believed that she did not have to assess the exact level of seriousness because it was sufficient that she found it was ""at least mid-range"".  But with respect, if that is how her Honour approached the matter, she was clearly in error.  Although such an assessment cannot be made with absolutely precision, it must at least indicate whether the offence is assessed as below, of, or above mid-range of seriousness with some indication as to the degree to which it departs from the mid-range if that is the finding.""  34The Crown accepted that his Honour failed to express his findings as to the objective seriousness of the offences with the precision required by Knight .  The Crown submitted, however, that his Honour's finding should be interpreted as a finding that counts 3 and 4 were at the mid-range of seriousness.  On that approach, the Crown submitted that there was no error in his Honour's sentences for counts 3 and 4 in that he clearly used the standard non-parole period as a guidepost and reduced it by 36 percent to reach a figure of 4  years.  35A troubling feature of his Honour's mode of expression is that which was identified by McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J in Knight i.e. that it was his Honour's opinion that counts 3 and 4 were above the mid-range for offences of that kind.  That assessment may well have influenced his Honour's assessment of sentence.  While this Court is reluctant to interfere with a sentencing judge's discretion when assessing the objective seriousness of an offence, it has to be said that on no reading of the facts of this case was it open to his Honour to find that the offences in counts 3 and 4 were above the mid-range.  36Accordingly, not only did his Honour's assessment of objective seriousness miscarry in the way conceded by the Crown but in assessing counts 3 and 4 at above the mid-range of seriousness his Honour clearly erred.  Ground of Appeal 3 - His Honour did not properly assess the totality of the criminal offending by determining the individual sentences and then assessing the totality but rather did the reverse.  37The Applicant submitted that his Honour, despite referring to R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 failed to apply the principles set out in that case.   He submitted that Pearce made clear that the court should impose appropriate sentences in accordance with law and then should consider the overall gravity of the criminality and adjust the final sentence so that the principles of totality and proportionality were observed.  The applicant submitted that his Honour did not follow that approach but rather determined the overall sentence before assessing the criminality relating to each offence and fixing appropriate sentences in respect of each offence.  38As the extract from the remarks on sentence makes clear, this submission has been made out (para [27]) hereof.  His Honour referred to 14 years as a start point for the overall sentence without setting out any rational basis for it.  It is clear that he then adjusted the individual sentences to fit within this assessment of the totality of the applicant's criminality.  That is the reverse of the process mandated by Pearce .  Ground of Appeal 4 - His Honour erred in not finding special circumstances.  39The applicant submitted that his Honour's reason for rejecting a finding of special circumstances was not one which was open to him.  The applicant submitted that a consideration of whether ""special circumstances"" should be found or not was concerned with the extent to which there was a need for additional supervision when an offender was released.  He submitted that the reason advanced by his Honour for not making such a finding was that the applicant had committed further offences, i.e. counts 3 and 4, while on bail.  The applicant submitted that this was an error and that the Court should find special circumstances and adjust the sentences accordingly.  40The principles applicable to the setting of a non-parole period of a sentence under s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are well settled.  The non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in custody having regard to all the elements of sentencing, such as punishment, rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances ( Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 627 - 629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [59], Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [26]).  41A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact in respect of which this Court is slow to intervene ( R v El Hayek (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at [103], R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31], Quayle v R [2010] NSWCCA 16 at [41]).  The extent of any adjustment to the ""statutory ratio"" is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge - R v Cramp at [31], Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33].  42In R v Simpson the issue both of what can constitute special circumstances and the nature of the exercise involved in determining what non-parole period should be imposed was discussed by a five member bench.  There Spigelman CJ, with whom Mason P, Grove J and Newman AJ agreed), said:  ""73  One practical effect of the statutory proportion has been to create a field of disputation which enables matters of fact and judgment to be expressed as if they constituted propositions of law. This arises only because the fetter is expressed in words which suggest a legal standard. It will be a very rare case in which there is no fact capable as a matter of law, of constituting a ""special circumstance"". The decision is first one of fact - to identify the circumstances - and, secondly, one of judgment - to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.""  43Notwithstanding the significant qualifications identified by Spigelman CJ which might prevent a court interfering with a finding as to special circumstances, it is difficult to see how the fact that the offences in counts 3 and 4 occurred whilst the applicant was on bail, has any relevance to a finding of special circumstances.  This is particularly so when it was common ground that this was the applicant's first time in custody and that the pre-sentence report identified the applicant as someone who would require an extended period of supervision when released on parole.  44On the facts of this case his Honour's refusal to find special circumstances cannot be justified and this ground of appeal has been made out.  Ground of Appeal 5 - The individual sentences and the total sentence are too severe.  His Honour erred in determining the length of the sentences given the plea of guilty and the objective seriousness of the offences.  45The applicant submitted that his Honour failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offences and failed to take into account the applicant's subjective case in fixing the sentences.  In particular, the applicant submitted that when one looked at the whole of the criminality, the total sentence passed was out of proportion to it and did not observe the principle of totality.  He submitted that the sentences were manifestly excessive.  46There is considerable force in the applicant's submission.  Part of the problem was the failure of his Honour to fix individual sentences and then stand back after setting those provisional sentences and reviewing them so as to be sure that they were appropriate for the offences at hand.  47There was also a difficulty in his Honour's failure to review the facts, both relating to the circumstances of the offences and in relation to the applicant's personal and medical circumstances.  A review of the offences would have revealed that while serious they occurred in a domestic relationship which involved considerable ambivalence on the part of the complainant. Whilst sexual assault even within the confines of a continuing relationship cannot be condoned, that fact and the comparatively low level of violence are matters of relevance to the objective seriousness of the offences.  Regrettably, that comment is made against the background of sexual assaults which come before this Court involving very considerable threats and violence.  48His Honour's failure to review the applicant's subjective case meant that the relationship between the circumstances of the offending and the applicant's family background and clinical depression may well have been lost sight of.  While his background and psychiatric difficulties provided no excuse for his offending, they did provide some explanation.  49For the above reasons I have concluded that this ground of appeal has also been made out.  50As the above analysis reveals, this sentencing exercise was replete with error.  Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant.  In doing so I have followed in part the sentencing scheme of his Honour, but have adjusted the sentences by way of concurrency and accumulation to better have regard to the principles of proportionality and totality insofar as the overall level of criminality is concerned.  51In doing so I should record my view that each of the first three offences was, because of the factors I have identified, substantially below the midrange of objective seriousness, albeit not at the bottom of that range.  The applicant's persistence in the face of the complainant's greater resistance in the case of the second offence makes that one somewhat more serious than the first.  52The fourth offence was also appreciably below the midrange although, because it was committed in the context of the threats made on the previous day, more serious than the previous three.  53Of course subjective features have also to be taken into account.  The most significant of these were the applicant's psychiatric and psychological circumstances which operate to appreciably mitigate his criminality and, operating in the opposite direction, the fact that he committed the third and fourth offences when on bail in respect of the first two.  54The evidence that this would be his first time in custody and that he would benefit from a longer than usual period of supervision leads to the conclusion that the Court should make a finding of special circumstances.  55The orders which I propose are:  That the sentences passed by his Honour on 16 June 2010 be quashed and that the applicant be re-sentenced as follows:  (i) In respect of count 1 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 6 February 2010 and expiring 5 February 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 5 February 2013.  (ii) In respect of count 2 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 6 August 2010 and expiring 5 August 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 5 August 2014.  (iii) In respect of count 3 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 6 August 2011 and expiring 5 August 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 5 August 2015.  (iv) In respect of count 4 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 5   years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 6 February 2012 and expiring 5 February 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring 5 August 2017.  56The effect of the sentence which I propose is imprisonment for 7   years with a non-parole period of 5 years.  57The applicant will be eligible for parole on 5 February 2015.  **********

		16 June 2011",2011-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757172,Thaver v R [2011] NSWCCA 106,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with Davies J. 

2Blanch J : I agree with Davies J. 

3Davies J : On 18 March 2010 the Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery in company, contrary to s 97(l) Crimes Act 1900, that took place on 31 December 2007. The victim of the robbery was a taxi driver in whose taxi the Applicant and his co-offender had travelled. 

4He was sentenced by Judge McLoughlin to a period of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 9 months. The sentence was to commence on 10 June 2012 with the non-parole period expiring on 9 March 2013. The Applicant appeals only on the basis that the sentencing judge was said to have erred in breaching the principle of parity. 

5The issue of parity is not a straight forward one because it involves other offences committed both by the Applicant and the co-offender. Further, it arises in a situation where the co-offender was sentenced for all the joint offences (together with another one where he alone was involved) by one judge (Judge Graham) and the Applicant was sentenced for 2 of the offences committed with the co-offender by another judge at an earlier time (Judge Knight). 

Facts 

6There were 3 offences involving the Applicant and his co-offender Frederick Peters. All involved the robbery of taxi drivers. The first of the offences was committed on 31 December 2007 (in respect of which Judge McLoughlin sentenced the Applicant giving rise to the present appeal). The second was on 18 January 2008, and the third was on 27 January 2008. 

(a) Offence of 31 December 2007 

7The victim in this matter was employed by Premier Cabs. At about 6.19pm on Monday 31 December 2007 a call was received from an unknown number, booking a cab for a pick up at 12 Chablis Place, Minchinbury by a male only referred to as 'Kevin'. The cab driver attended this address. He used his horn to get the attention of the persons and a short time later, the co-offender Peters walked out to the taxi and sat in the front passenger seat requesting that the driver wait for his friend. 

8Another male, shortly thereafter, walked out and the driver was directed to attend another address in Minchinbury, the home of the Applicant. The Applicant entered the taxi and the driver was then directed to attend an address in Colyton where the third male exited the vehicle and returned about ten minutes later. The 3 men requested the driver to drive them to Bondi for a seventy five dollar fare. The driver said that the fare to Bondi would be more than seventy-five dollars. 

9Ultimately it was agreed that the driver would take them in to Parramatta. During the course of the journey it would appear that the Applicant and Peters both either drank from, or had in their hands, a cardboard carton of apple juice. 

10After the taxi stopped at the car park at Lennox bridge in Parramatta and the driver requested fare payment Peters grabbed him by the throat. At this stage the apple juice carton was dropped and Peters placed his hands around the victim. The victim is of the view that all males were assisting in holding him down with Peters saying ""Give me your money and wallet"". 

11The victim handed money to one of the males, and Peters said ""Give us the keys and your mobile"". The victim handed the keys and his mobile phone to Peters. As this took place, Peters took the on-board camera and attempted to break it. All the males jumped out of the taxi and walked east along Parramatta River Bank. 

12At this stage the Applicant had the keys and threw them towards the victim before walking off. The victim lost sight of the assailants at Church Street, and drove his taxi to George Street securing it and then attending Parramatta Police Station. 

13Detectives, on inspecting the motor vehicle, located the apple juice carton which ultimately produced DNA profiles of the Applicant and Peters. At the time the Applicant was interviewed, he told police he could not remember the incident and he was under the influence of drugs, Ice and alcohol, at the time of the robbery with no recollection of this time in his life. 

(b) Offence of 18 January 2008 
14At about 10.10pm on Friday 18 January 2008 Uma Chand was driving a taxi, registration T504. He was notified by his in-car radio to attend Traminer Place, Minchinbury, as there was a fare to Rooty Hill via Mount Druitt. He went to Traminer Place, Minchinbury, where he saw the Applicant and Peters. The Applicant took a seat in the rear of the taxi and Peters sat in the front passenger seat of the taxi. Peters handed the driver a $20 note, telling him that they could be trusted. The driver drove from the area before being told shortly afterwards by the Applicant to return to Traminer Place, as the Applicant had left his phone at that location. The driver turned his taxi around, returning to Traminer Place. 

15As he drove into Traminer Place, returning to the vicinity where he had first seen the Applicant and Peters, the Applicant took the driver in a headlock from the rear, pulling him into the rear seat of the taxi. Peters pulled the handbrake on, stopping the vehicle. Peters got on top of the driver, saying, ""I've got a knife."" The driver saw Peters remove an object that was shiny from his chest area. Peters said, ""Don't move or I'll put this knife in your chest."" He said, ""Give me all the money."" Peters then went through the pockets of the driver , removing money from his pants and his shirt pockets. Peters also removed cash from the sock of the driver, and both the Applicant and Peters placed pressure on the driver by pushing him into the seat and centre console area of the vehicle, preventing him from moving. He was asked about his wallet and he replied that he did not carry one. His mobile phone was removed from his pants belt, this being a black Nokia mobile phone. The Applicant and Peters then fled the area on foot. 

16Police were called, and the taxi was towed for scientific examination. The taxi had closed circuit television attached which depicted the entire incident. 

17As a result of the attack, the driver was distressed and suffered soreness to his upper body. He had a total of $375 and a Nokia mobile phone stolen from him. 

(c) Offence of 27 January 2008 

18At about 12.30am on Saturday 27 January 2008 Numan Bhatti was driving a taxi, registration number T7105. He was notified by his in-car radio to attend McFarlane Drive, Minchinbury, as there was a fare to Rooty Hill. He drove onto McFarlane Drive, and Peters approached the driver and took a seat in the front of the taxi. The Applicant and an unidentified man entered the rear of the taxi and took a seat in the back. The driver was directed to follow a small white hatch vehicle that was in front of the taxi. That white vehicle was followed to the Doonside area and Peters then said that he wanted to go to the city. The driver said he would not take Peters there, and Peters and the Applicant then told the driver to drive them back to Minchinbury. The driver was directed to Traminer Place, Minchinbury, and told to stop his vehicle in an identical position to the offence of 18 January. That position enabled a quick escape of the offenders, as it was near a laneway. 

19Peters directed the driver to turn his vehicle lights off, which the driver declined to do. Peters then said, ""I told you to turn them off,"" and the Applicant then pulled the driver from the front seat in a headlock towards the rear seat. The unidentified man struck the driver numerous times to the head with a bottle. Peters started to punch the driver to the upper body with his closed fist. 

20Due to the frenzied attack on him, the driver undid his bumbag and threw it at the Applicant, telling him to take it. It contained a Nokia mobile phone and $250 in cash. The unidentified man got out of the back of the taxi and pulled the driver from the vehicle. The driver fell onto the roadway. Peters then got out of the vehicle and the driver fled the area on foot, thinking he was going to be killed. 

21He sought the assistance of a passer-by, the police were called and later attended. The vehicle of the driver was secured for forensic examination. The taxi driven by the driver had closed circuit television attached which showed the whole entire incident. 
22As a result of the assault on him, the driver suffered numerous cuts and scratches. He sustained three significant lacerations that required eleven sutures. That constituted the wounding element of the offence. He sustained bruising to the hand as a result of attempting to prevent further assault with the bottle and the punches that were inflicted on him. He was extremely distressed as a result of the incident and was visibly shaken a number of days later. 

Sentences 

23The Applicant was sentenced by Judge Knight on 10 December 2008 in respect of the offences of 18 January 2008 and 27 January 2008. In sentencing the Applicant for the offence of 27 January 2008 Judge Knight also took into account an offence of break, enter and steal committed on 14 August 2004. Judge Knight allowed a discount of 25% for the Applicant's plea of guilty, and a further discount of 10% for promised assistance. 

24In relation to the offence of 18 January 2008 the Applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 10 December 2008 and expire on 9 June 2010. In relation to the offence of 27 January 2008, and taking into account the Form 1 offence, the Applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing 10 December 2009 and expiring on 9 June 2012. 

25His Honour said that he wanted to make it quite plain that it was his intention that overall the Applicant should be sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a 3 year 6 month non-parole period. His Honour added when addressing the Applicant that he had chosen to deal with the Applicant in what his Honour regarded as a lenient fashion. 

26The sentence imposed by Judge McLoughlin on 26 May 2010 commenced at the expiry of the Applicant's non-parole period of 9 June 2012 as fixed by Judge Knight. When the 3 offences are considered together the overall sentence was one of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months. 

The co-offender Peters 

27Peters was sentenced for the same 3 offences and a further offence of robbery committed on 18 October 2007 by Judge Graham on 8 April 2009. 

28Judge Graham gave a discount of 20% for the plea of guilty in respect of the offences of 18 and 27 January 2008. He gave a discount of 25% for a guilty plea in respect of the offence of 31 December 2007, the offence the subject of this appeal. When Judge Graham sentenced Peters he had available to him the Remarks on Sentence by Judge Knight in respect of the Applicant for the offences of 18 and 27 January 2008. 

29Judge Graham sentenced Peters as follows. In relation to the offence of robbery (which did not involve the Applicant) he was given a f ixed term of 18 months commencing on 30 January 2008 and expiring on 29 July 2009. In relation to the offence of 31 December 2007 ( the offence the subject of this appeal) he was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years commencing 30 January 2009 and expiring 29 January 2011. 

30In relation to the offence of 18 January 2008 he was sentenced t o a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment commencing 30 January 2010 and expiring 29 July 2011. In relation to the offence of 27 January 2008 he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 30 January 2011 and expiring 29 January 2013. 

31If the offence of robbery on 18 October 2007 is ignored, having regard to the accumulation of the sentences, Peters received an overall term for the 3 offences common to him and the Applicant of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 

Remarks on Sentence 

32Judge McLoughlin was very conscious of the principle of parity and mentioned it a number of times in the course of his Remarks on Sentence. His Honour first recited the facts and then noted the sentences which Peters had been given. He said that a matter of aggravation in relation to the 3 offences common to the Applicant and Peters was that Peters was on bail at the time of their offence for his earlier offence of robbery. He also noted that the Applicant was 15 months younger than Peters. 

33His Honour made reference to the discounts received by Peters and by the Applicant when Judge Knight sentenced him and said: 

I repeat much of this in order that I can deal with the question of parity in this sentence. 

34His Honour said that both the Applicant and Peters had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs, that the Applicant had no relevant criminal history and had been in responsible employment until shortly before the commission of the offences. 

35His Honour then said this: 

This offender was sentenced on 10 December 2008 with a total sentence of six years with three and a half years in custody, to be released on parole. The co-offender Peters was charged with this offence on 19 November 2008. When the police had harvested the DNA and there is no evidence as to why this offender was not charged before being dealt with by the court on 10 December 2008. If that had been the case this offender would have been dealt with in all matters at that time and he would have been sentenced at that time for this matter in addition to the others. It would also appear that in relation to this offence the co-offender Peters was the main aggressor. 

36His Honour then noted some remarks made by Judge Graham and said: 

His Honour had facts before him which I do not have before this court as to there being an object held against the taxi driver. I only make reference to that in attempting to give parity to the sentence that I am going to give. 

37His Honour set out some further remarks from Judge Graham concerning the vulnerability of taxi drivers and then said: 

This offender is charged with robbery in relation to this offence but I again have made reference to his Honour's comments in order to deal with the question of parity. 

38His Honour noted that for the offence committed on 31 December 2007 Peters was given a sentence of 2 years imprisonment. He went on to say: 

I regard the offender's involvement in this offence as being a little below the middle of any scale constructed for such an offence. Mr Kennedy, learned counsel for the offender submits that the court in constructing the prison sentence would have regard to parity and this should result in this sentence being somewhat less than that given to the co-offender Peters because of the extra offence of Peters, Peters being older, his greater involvement in this offence and he has a record of some matters before the commission of these offences which this offender does not. 

Notwithstanding the matters on the Form 1 which were taken into 
account when this offender was sentenced, I agree to that submission. This offender was first convicted on 30 November 1999 at the Bidura Children's Court, for Enter prescribed premises without lawful excuse for which he was placed on a six month s 33(1)(b) bond and that is the only matter on his record until the commission of this offence. 

39His Honour set out the sentences given to Peters for the offence of 18 and 27 January 2008. He set out a long extract from the report of the Probation and Parole Officer in respect of the Applicant and then said this: 

I accept that the offender has no real memory of this offence and it would have been preferable if this matter was dealt with at the same time as the other matters on 10 December 2008. 

Whilst it may not be indicated by statute, to deal with his sentence in this way, because of the circumstances I propose to first refer to an overall sentence in order that the parity and my reasons for it can be ascertained and then to pass sentence as required. 

Bearing in mind the matters to which I have referred I am of the view that this offender should serve a head sentence of some seven years with a non-parole period of some four years and three months. As the earlier sentencing judge has done I also find special circumstances because of his youth, his first time in prison and the reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. 

40Thereupon his Honour sentenced the Applicant to the 9 month non-parole period with an additional sentence of 15 months which his Honour said commenced on 10 March 2013 and expired on 9 December 2015. I will return to consider the expiry of the sentence later in this judgment. 

The Applicant's submissions 

41The Applicant in his written submissions said that Judge McLoughlin ought to have imposed a sentence on the Applicant that would have meant the Applicant received overall a non-parole period of at least 1 year less than that imposed on Peters. The Applicant points to the following matters which, in total, it is submitted, should have resulted in a shorter non-parole period of at least 1 year. 

a)Mr Peters had committed an additional offence, i.e. his count 1; 

b)as at the time Mr Peters committed counts 2, 3 & 4, he was on bail in respect of his count 1; 

c)Mr Peters was the older offender; 

d)Mr Peters was the main aggressor in respect of the offence giving rise to count 1 against the applicant (i.e. the 31 December 2007 offence); 

e)Mr Peters had been given a smaller discount for his guilty pleas -i.e. a 20% discount for his pleas of guilty, whereas the applicant had been given a discount of 25% for his guilty pleas; 

f)the applicant had also been given a 10% discount for proposed assistance when sentenced for his count 2 and 3; 

g)Mr Peters had a lengthier prior criminal record (the applicant had only one matter which occurred .when he was a minor); and 

h)arising out of the 31 December 2007 incident, Mr Peters was charged with Armed Robbery with an Offensive weapon, whereas the applicant was charged with Robbery in Company, and although both constitute an offence under s.97 of the Crimes Act 1900 the sentencing facts for Mr Peters also included a reference to a sharp object being held against the victim's throat. 

42At the hearing of the appeal, and despite the year's reduction sought in the written submissions, counsel for the Applicant asked only that the non-parole period should be reduced by 3 months to bring it into line with the total non-parole period which formed part of Peters' sentence. The Applicant submitted that the sentence imposed by Judge McLoughlin was imposed in the light of the earlier sentences that had been imposed on the Applicant by Judge Knight. The Applicant submitted that the overall sentences imposed on both the Applicant and Peters should be taken into account, but when it was pointed out that there was no application to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Knight the Applicant sought leave to bring such an application. That leave was opposed by the Crown on the basis that the Crown had only come to argue parity in relation to the sentence for the offence of 31 December 2007. The Court indicated that it would reserve its decision both on the application to amend to seek leave to appeal against Judge Knight's sentences as well as on the application to appeal against Judge McLoughlin's decision. 

The parity principle is not offended 

(a) The sentence for the offence of 31 December 2007 

43Before this Court will intervene in relation to a disparity between sentences of co-offenders it must be shown that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance or to give the appearance that justice has not been done. Ordinarily there will need to be a marked disparity in sentences before this Court will intervene: Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609, 611 and 623. 

44If attention is confined to the sentences imposed only in respect of the offence of 31 December 2007, each of the offenders received a sentence of 2 years for the offence. Peters was required to serve a fixed term of 2 years but that was because the offence was dealt with in conjunction with all of the other offences including an offence with which the Applicant had no involvement. Nevertheless, the Applicant's sentence was no more onerous than that imposed on Peters and, in fact, the Applicant was only required to serve 9 months of that sentence before he was eligible for parole. Even if all of the matters enumerated by the Applicant about the differences between him and Peters are accepted as correct it cannot be said that there is any disparity, let alone a marked disparity, which works against the Applicant. 

(b) Application to amend 

45The Crown says it is prejudiced by the late application to amend to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Knight. When the Crown has not had the opportunity to put before the Court any further material concerning those sentences, and has not had any opportunity to prepare argument in relation to those sentences including how they relate to the sentences imposed against Peters, it would not be appropriate to grant the leave the Applicant now seeks to amend. 

46However, in fairness to the Applicant and to avoid any perception that the Applicant has been disadvantaged by the course of events that led to the 2 separate sentence hearings I will consider the relevant material available at the hearing of the present appeal. 

47On the imposition of the sentence by Judge Knight the position with regard to parity was that the Applicant had received a sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months whereas Peters had received a sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. The difference is to be found in the non-parole period ordered in respect of the offence of 27 January. Some matters might suggest that this outcome was unfavourable to the Applicant including that Peters was the principal aggressor in relation to the 2 offences of 18 January and 27 January, that Peters committed those offences whilst on bail in respect of the robbery he had committed unconnected with the Applicant, and that Peters received a discount of 20% for those offences whereas the Applicant received a combined discount of 35%. One reason for the disparity may well have been that Judge Graham took the view that the 4 offences for which he sentenced Peters were: 

... all part of the same burst of criminality on the part of a man of twenty-six or twenty-seven who had not previously exhibited such a serious disregard for the criminal law. 

48Perhaps because Judge Knight was only sentencing the Applicant for 2 offences, he does not seem to have regarded the offences in the same way with the result that the penalties for the 2 offences were accumulated except for a 6 month period. 

49However, there were subjective factors which might also explain the difference in the sentences. These are referred to in the remarks of Judge Graham when sentencing Peters. These matters included abandonment by his parents, physical abuse, a period of living on the streets, his alcohol and substance abuse and the fact that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. In relation to the post-traumatic stress disorder the psychologist said that his experience of maturing into a young adult had been severely inhibited and affected by his experience of PTSD. By contrast the Applicant, as noted by Judge Graham, had a good education and vocational qualifications and experience and had been employed until shortly before he was first sentenced in December 2008 by Judge Knight. 

50For those reasons Judge Graham said that, despite the more prominent role of Peters in the offences committed with the Applicant, those subjective matters meant that the sentence imposed upon Peters should not be greater than the sentence imposed upon the Applicant. 

51Moreover, as Judge Graham pointed out, when Judge Knight came to sentence the Applicant for the offence of 27 January he was taking into account an offence of breaking, entering and stealing where jewellery and other items totalling in value something over $2000 were taken and in the course of the robbery 4 rooms in the house were destroyed. 

52Other differences between the Applicant and Peters were relatively insignificant. Although Peters was older (but only by 16 months) both offenders were adults. Although Peters had more offences on his criminal record they were not offences of any great significance and Judge Graham accepted the Crown's concession that he did not have a significant criminal history. 

53These matters provide a sufficient explanation why there might have been some disparity in the sentences for the offences of January 2008. In the light of those matters the disparity was not such, in my opinion, as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance or to a view that justice had not been done. Even, therefore, if the Crown was not prejudiced by the late application without notice, I do not consider the material discloses any basis for a conclusion that the parity principle has been offended by reason of the sentences imposed by Judge Knight. 

(c) Consideration of all 3 sentences 

54The Applicant says that the sentences imposed by Judge McLoughlin must be seen in the light of the sentence imposed by Judge Knight even if no appeal is brought against the sentence of Judge Knight. Although it was not articulated as such, that submission seems to suggest that when applying the totality principle the sentence imposed by Judge McLoughlin ought to have been a lower one. That would appear to be because, if the Applicant had been sentenced for all his offences at the same time, he would have been given a lower sentence than that given to the co-offender Peters. 

55The issue is one of determining whether the extra 3 month non-parole period required to be served by the Applicant compared with the non-parole period given to Peters, when taken in conjunction with the differences between the 2 offenders, amounts to a marked disparity or gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. 

56I drew attention above to a number of matters which might be thought to have justified the difference in the sentence given to the Applicant. The 2 significant matters were the subjective factors that favoured Peters and the Form 1 offence taken into account by Judge Knight when sentencing the Applicant. The nature of the Form 1 offence is likely to have had an effect on the sentence imposed on the Applicant where that Form 1 offence was taken into account. 

57What is of greater significance, however, is that, although there was a disparity in the sentences for the offences of 18 and 27 January, when Judge McLoughlin came to sentence the Applicant for offence of 31 December the non-parole period that he imposed had the effect of evening out the disparity at least to the extent of 3 months, with the result that, overall, the Applicant must serve 3 months more in prison for the 3 offences than the co-offender Peters. 

58It cannot be said that an overall sentence for the Applicant that involves him serving an extra 3 months non-parole period compared with that to be served by Peters represents a marked disparity or is such that it can give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. A 3 months disparity in that regard is well within the appropriate discretion of the sentencing judge having regard to all of the appropriate matters to be considered in relation to the Applicant and Peters. 

Expiry of the sentence 

59When Judge McLoughlin came to pronounce the sentence he said this: 

Bearing in mind the matters to which I have referred I am of the view that this offender should serve a head sentence of some seven years with a non-parole period of some four years and three months. 

He then sentenced the Applicant to a 9 month non-parole period from 10 June 2012 (the date on which his non-parole period ordered by Judge Knight expired) and expire on 9 March 2013. His Honour sentenced him to a further term of 15 months which his Honour said was to commence on 10 March 2013 (the day on which his non-parole period expired) and would expire on 9 December 2015. However, the additional sentence, if it was to commence on 10 March 2013, would expire on 9 July 2014. 

60The head sentence imposed by Judge Knight did not expire until 9 December 2014. The effect of the additional term imposed by Judge McLoughlin was that it would be entirely concurrent with the head sentence imposed by Judge Knight. That was inconsistent with Judge McLoughlin's stated view that the Applicant should serve a head sentence of 7 years. A 7 year head sentence would have expired on 9 December 2015. 

61If the head sentence expires on 9 December 2014 it is a period of 72 months with a non-parole period of 51 months. That is within the normal statutory ratio. If the overall head sentence was 7 years (84 months) the period of the non-parole period would be less than the statutory ratio although his Honour found special circumstances for the purpose of the sentence he imposed. 

62The Crown accepts that the correct date for the expiry of the additional sentence is 9 June 2014. In the light of the ambiguity in the Sentencing Judge's Remarks the Crown's concession should be accepted and the expiry date for the additional sentence should be altered to read 9 June 2014. 

Conclusion 

63For the above reasons I propose the following orders: 

(1) Leave to amend to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Knight refused. 

(2) Leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge McLoughlin granted. 

(3) The additional term ordered by Judge McLouglin of 15 months imprisonment commence on 10 March 2013 and expires on 9 July 2014 . On this sentence order that the Applicant is to be released to parole on 9 March 2013. 

(4) The appeal is otherwise dismissed.

		10 June 2011",2011-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757177,R v HADDAD [2011] NSWDC 137,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: On 21 October 2009 the offender, Wadi Farid Haddad, committed a very serious criminal offence. It would ordinarily see him serve a lengthy period of imprisonment. 

2However, there is one particular circumstance concerning the offender's mental health which substantially reduces the offender's moral culpability for his offending. It probably does not in any way lessen the impact of the serious offence upon its victim, so the fact that the young boy was assaulted by someone who was mentally ill is unlikely to be any comfort to him. But the fact that the offender was mentally ill at the time of committing this offence means that the sentence I will impose upon him is substantially less than it would otherwise be. 

3In the months leading up to 21 October 2009 it is clear that the offender was substantially mentally unwell. He had been admitted to James Fletcher Hospital in April 2009 after relapsing into a manic episode involving behaviour that was impossible to explain. This period of admission followed many other episodes in the offender's life when he exhibited symptoms of psychosis. 

4He was living alone at the time of the offence. It was in those circumstances that he and the complainant in this matter, who were strangers to each other, met near the Charlestown Library. The complainant was heading off to work. He was then thirteen years of age. Before going to work he intended to go to the library to access the internet. The offender, who I repeat was a stranger to the complainant, rode up on his bicycle and stopped in front of the complainant. He said hello and asked him where he was from. Upon learning that the complainant was from a country where French was spoken, the offender told the complainant that he was from Egypt, and they thereafter spoke in French. 

5The offender told the complainant things about himself and asked the complainant questions about things such as the complainant's hobbies and the like. The offender also produced a stethoscope, telling the complainant that he was a doctor. In fact, the offender had been a doctor, but lost his registration on one occasion because of an offence broadly similar to that which I am about to describe. 

6The complainant told the offender that he wanted to go to the library to check his emails, but the offender asked him to stay a while. He then placed his hand between the complainant's legs and rubbed him. The complainant tried to get the offender to stop, but he kept going. 

7A female passer-by came on the scene, which caused the offender to stop. The complainant asked her to stop, but she did not. 

8The offender then took a notepad from his backpack and wrote on it personal details of his, and also told the complainant his mobile phone number. He then said to the complainant, ""If you give me a little favour, then I will give you money."" 

9The offender then grabbed the complainant, said, ""I love you,"" and kissed him on the mouth. The complainant asked to be let go. 

10The offender told the complainant, ""Just go and wait in the library; I'll be right in."" Once they got inside the library, the offender insisted that the complainant go into the bathroom with him. 

11It must be remembered that this young boy was only thirteen years of age. He complied with the offender's demand because, as he told police, he thought the offender was going to bash him if he did not do what he was asked. So the two of them, the offender and the complainant, went into the bathroom. 

12The offender removed his clothes and the pants of the complainant. Various forms of sexual activity occurred, until the offender put the complainant's penis in his mouth. He told the complainant, ""I'm not going to stop until you come."" Eventually the complainant ejaculated. The offender then stood up and kissed the complainant on the mouth and told him, ""Kiss me, kiss me."" He then grabbed the complainant's hand and placed it on his penis. 

13The act of fellatio that I have just described forms the basis of the offence for which the offender must be sentenced, that of having sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and fourteen, namely, thirteen years. The maximum penalty for that offence is sixteen years imprisonment. 

14The act of grabbing the complainant's hand and placing it on his penis forms the basis of an offence that the offender asks that I take into account when sentencing him for the substantive matter. 

15After the incidents that I have just described, they both dressed. The offender asked the complainant to keep in contact with him, and he left the bathroom. 

16Various people in the library identified that something suspicious was going on. One of the library staff saw the offender come out of the bathroom about two or three minutes after the complainant had approached her and asked her to call the police. She knew the offender because he was a user of the library. She was able to identify his name and pass that on to police. 

17Various forensic tests, in particular those involving DNA analysis, were carried out and evidence suggesting that sexual activity such as I have described took place was found. 

18The offender was arrested on 23 October 2009, two days after the offence. He refused to speak to police but a search warrant was executed at his premises and incriminating items were found, including the stethoscope that I mentioned. 

19Quite clearly, objectively this is a very serious matter. The offender was a complete stranger to the complainant and yet through his actions he was able to commit a most serious criminal offence upon him. He was able to take advantage of the young boy's fear to satisfy what he was then feeling, sexual attraction to young men. 

20I mentioned before that this offence occurred some months after the offender had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Upon the offender being taken into custody he showed signs of mania, including cleaning his cell naked with a broom and water for two or three hours and presenting himself to the clinic in the police cells wearing a blanket as a toga. 

21He was subsequently admitted to the Mental Health Screening Unit in Long Bay Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a mood disorder and treated under the Mental Health Act . 

22The community is sometimes entitled to be a bit suspicious when a person commits an offence such as this and then claims to be mentally ill at the time, but there is substantial evidence of a significant mental illness affecting the offender, both before and after the offence was committed. 

23I am satisfied that the offender was suffering from a bipolar disorder at the time of the offence. Most importantly, when his moral culpability is concerned, his mental disorder had a substantial impact on his ability to control his impulses. 

24The offender has been treated whilst in custody and is now regularly taking a drug which controls his disorder. He said in evidence today that he is a different person to the person who committed this offence. He no longer, he says, has an attraction to young men and now is in a position to recognise what he has done, and says that he has remorse, both for the victim of his crime and for his family. 

25The offender is now sixty-three years of age. He was born in Egypt but came to Australia as a child. He graduated from the University of New South Wales with a Bachelor of Medicine and worked as a GP, but even at that early stage in his life, problems with his mental state were apparent. Whilst still a medical student he had been admitted to Callan Park Psychiatric Hospital. 

26In 1994 he was deregistered. That followed on from the commission by him of a criminal offence involving a sexual assault upon one of his patients. He manipulated the patient's penis and testicles and hugged and kissed him, and solicited the patient to engage in oral sex. 

27He denied his guilt in that matter but was found guilty by a jury, although ultimately the judge who came to sentence him dismissed the matter under section 556A as it then was of the Crimes Act in the light of the offender's character and service to medicine. (I will not pause to discuss the problems with that reasoning). 

28However, the offender remained deregistered until 1998, when he briefly worked again as a GP. He is now no longer registered as a medical practitioner and so what he was doing with a stethoscope is difficult to determine. 

29The effects that the fact that a person is mentally ill at the time of an offence have upon the sentence to be imposed are well known. Perhaps most importantly, the offender's moral culpability is reduced. He was less able than a person who is psychiatrically well to control the impulses that he must have been feeling on 21 October 2009. The commission of the offence is in that way connected to the mental illness from which he was then suffering. 

30The offender is a person upon whom it is inappropriate to impose a sentence which contains a large measure of general deterrence. On the other hand, I am satisfied that there is a need for the offender to be personally deterred. 

31I cannot say that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. He is doing well at present whilst in custody upon the medication that he is taking, but his behaviour in the community as a free person is, of course, unknown. There are indications that he will continue to take his medication, but he needs to be reminded that if he does not, and if he thereby commits a criminal offence, he will receive significant punishment. 

32There is no doubt that the offender has caused harm to the complainant. There was no evidence regarding the psychological impact upon the complainant because the complainant did not wish to provide a victim impact statement. That is perfectly understandable. A person in the position of the complainant is quite likely to wish to put the matter behind him, but of course, the absence of a victim impact statement does not mean that no harm has been occasioned by the offender's conduct. 

33That the victims of crimes such as these will suffer psychologically in the future is well known, and it is what makes offences of this kind particularly serious. 

34Some time was spent discussing the appropriate discount for the offender's plea of guilty. It did not come early, and it was only in fact the day after the offender's trial was due to commence that he entered a plea of guilty. 

35Mr Marr suggested there may be a reason for that, relating to the offender only being well enough to appreciate what he had in fact done shortly before the plea was entered. That may well be the case. But the fact remains that the utilitarian value of the offender's plea of guilty was limited. In those circumstances I propose to impose a sentence upon the offender which is 10 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

36It cannot be denied that objectively this is a most serious offence. Following a chance meeting between the two, the offender invited the complainant into the library and committed the offence upon him. He was the stranger that we warn our children about. 

37If I looked only at the objective circumstances of this offence, I would impose upon the offender a very lengthy term of imprisonment, but as I mentioned at the outset of these remarks on sentence, the fact that the offender was mentally ill at the time of the offence means that I will impose a sentence upon him which is substantially less. 

38It is my job to impose a sentence which is appropriate both for the offence and the offender, and when I look at the offender, I look at what he was then and what he is now. I could quite understand anyone who looked only at the facts of this matter forming the view that the sentence I am about to impose is manifestly inadequate, but when account is taken of the mental state of the offender at the time he committed the offence, the sentence I am about to announce is, I believe, the appropriate one. 

39I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour, due to his age and this being the first time he has served a sentence of imprisonment. 

40Taking into account the matter of the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. It will date from 23 October 2009, the day on which the offender went into custody and has remained since. I set a non-parole period of two years and three months, which will expire on 22 January 2012 and a head sentence of four years and six months. The offender is thus eligible to be released to parole on 22 January 2012.

2757180,Khazaal v R [2011] NSWCCA 129,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant pleaded not guilty to one count of making a document connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act, knowing of that connection contrary to s 101.5(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Code"") and to one count of attempting to urge another to engage in a terrorist act contrary to ss 11.1(1), 11.4(1) and 101.1(1) of the Code. Following a trial in the Supreme Court, the appellant was convicted in relation to count 1. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in relation to count 2. The offence of which the appellant was convicted attracts a maximum penalty of 15 years. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years (R v Khazaal [2009] NSWSC 1015). He appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.

THE INDICTMENT
2The indictment dated 3 July 2008 was in the following terms:

""Count 1:
That between 20 September 2003 and 23 September 2003 at Sydney and elsewhere in the world he did make a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act knowing of that connection contrary to the provisions of s 101.5(1) of the Criminal Code.

Count 2:
That between 22 September 2003 and about 8 October 2003 at Sydney and elsewhere in the world he did attempt to urge the commission by others of an offence, namely, engaging in a terrorist act contrary to s 101.1(1) of the Criminal Code.""

3In relation to count 1 the indictment alleged:

""1.1 The document made was a book titled 'Provisions on the Rules of Jihad - Short Judicial rulings and organisational instructions for fighters and Mujahideen against infidels'.

1.2 The terrorist act was an action or threat of action against any one or more of a number of persons identified in the document including diplomats, military personnel and holders of public offence done or threatened""

(a) with the intention of advancing a political religious or ideological cause, namely the advancement of the Muslim religion in the world including the dominance of that religion in Arabia as defined in the document and/or the establishment of a Muslim nation in that region and/or the expulsion of Jews, Christians and other non-Muslims from that region; and

(b) with the intention of:

i. coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or of a foreign country; or

ii. intimidating the public or a section of the public; and

(c) in circumstances where the action, if carried out, would:-

i. cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or

ii. cause serious damage to property; or

iii. cause a person's death; or

iv. endanger a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or

v. create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public; and

(d) the action or threat of action was not to be done as advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action.

Alternatively, if the action or threat of action was to be done as advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action, it would be of a kind intended to:

i. cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or

ii. cause a person's death; or

iii. endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or

iv. create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.""

THE CASE AT TRIAL
5In summary, the Crown case was that between 20 - 23 September 2003, the appellant downloaded from the Internet material of a religious and ""jihadist"" nature and compiled an electronic book entitled ""Provisions on the Rules of Jihad - Short Judicial Rulings and Organisational Instructions for Fighters and Mujahideen Against Infidels"" (""the e-book""). After downloading the material, which was in Arabic, the appellant edited parts of it and renumbered the footnotes. He inserted a dedication and a foreword. Using a pseudonym, he submitted the e-book (which he described as ""urging for jihad"") to the administrators of a website which was connected with al-Qaeda (""the Almaqdese website""). The Almaqdese website contained a number of other publications composed by leaders of known terrorist groups. The appellant made some final formatting changes and the e-book was published on the Almaqdese website. The Crown contended that the appellant's acts of selecting, compiling and editing the downloaded content and introducing his own material constituted the ""making of a document"" and those acts must have been ""intentional"". 

6Chapter 10 of the e-book was entitled ""Reasons for Assassination"". This and other chapters commenced with the appellant's own commentary endorsing the substance of the chapter. Chapter 10 contained the following sub-headings:

""Characteristics of the Assassination Team

Training Team members

Optimal conditions for assassination

Features and stages of the assassination process

Security precautions

First: Wireless Distant Detonating Device (Remote Control)

Security measures prior and post detonation

Second Method: letters and letter bombs

Third Method: Booby Trapping a car

Security alerts to Mujahideen in some battle fields like Palestine

Fourth method: Detonating a car from a distance

Caution to the wanted Mujahideen who fear assassination by Mossad in Palestine

Fifth Method: Sniping

Sixth Method: Smothering

Seventh Method: Hitting with a Hammer

Eighth Method: Booby Trapping a room

Other methods

Targets that should be assassinated

Benefits of assassination

Modern Assassination stories

Successful operations.""

7The section entitled ""Characteristics of the assassination team"" identifies traits that are necessary or desirable for assassins. These include physical fitness, courage and ""terrorist psychology"". The section headed ""Optimal conditions for assassination"" provides a list of scenarios in which targets are most vulnerable to attack. Those include ""When the target is alone, unprotected and unaccompanied"", ""When the target is away from his home or office with little protection"", ""When target announces his movements such as attending a conference"", and ""When target opens his own mail or doors for his guests"". 

8The section headed ""Features and stages of the assassination process"" summarises the various means by which targets can be assassinated. It concludes with the following comments:

""These types of assassination were listed in order of safety and cost. Regardless of the style, assassination operations require special characteristics and a talented Mujahid. After several successful assassination operations the element becomes a professional specialist. After three successful assassination operations and a kidnapping operation the element becomes an advanced specialist and can be appointed to lead a cell.""

9Chapter 10 also outlines the functions of the ""Distracting Group"" whose primary task is said to be to divert the attention of security personnel prior to a terrorist attack:

""Such group works on distracting enemy security. Timing is of key importance and so is coordination with the execution party. For instance, if the assassination was to use mortar then a high-pitch noise such as cars, engines or car horns would be appropriate to cover the noise of the mortar shell or the noise of snipers in case no silencer was used.""

10Chapter 10 goes on to provide detailed information about various assassination techniques including remote-controlled bombs, letter bombs (and the means by which such devices can pass through security screening) and smothering. The latter section reads:

""It primarily works on plugging the air ducts particularly the mouth and the nose which could be done by placing one's hand and keeping it on the target's nose till he dies. Alternatively, keeping his face to the ground or wrapping the face with tape that would prevent him from breathing ... 

One of these techniques is to tie the target with a metal rope over his chest and tighten the rope till the trachea contracts and can not open. This leads to suffocation the same way a boa would hold and kill its prey. 

...

Another method albeit one that requires more than one person to carry it out is wrapping the target in a strong plastic bag. This hardly leaves a trace on the body of the target. Enemy security could have the impression that it was a suicide.""

11The section entitled ""Targets that should be assassinated"" reads as follows:

""Identities that should be assassinated are in this order, as far as I think:

1 - All Jewish, Christian and Arab atheists among the diplomats, ambassadors and the military in Arabia. The definition of Arabia for Mujahideen is the area that covers Yemen, Oman, Saudi, Kuwait, Qatar, The Emirates and Bahrain. This extension is due to the legal texts that call for the expulsion of Jews and Christians and Infidels from Arabia. The enemy nationalities are ranked in accordance to their importance:

1. American.
2. British
3. French
4. Rest of NATO members
5. Rest of Christians
6. Hindus and Buddhists
7. Russians

These nationalities, with the aid and participation of Jews, fight, kill, rape and pillage Muslims. This is well-known world wide and is for everyone to see. ...

2 - Imams of apostasy: Who exist in Arabia such as state presidents, ministers of the Interior, Foreign ministers, ministers of Defense who are promoting and defending atheism. The rest of the Imams of apostasy in the Arab Countries which are falsely called Islamic states such as Abu Reghal and his four men, Barvez - Brazen - Mussharaf, Hosni Mubarak, Yasser Arafat and the rest of the list. In addition to anyone who blasphemes God or the prophet such as journalists and the media whose insult has been proven publicly, by confession or through witnesses has joined the list of enemies. I have explained this in my book (Guide book for the rulings on killing policemen and investigators)

3 - Holders of key positions in the original countries of atheism fighting us such as the president, then the minister of defense, foreign minister, Chief of Intelligence, National Security and the high ranking generals. The countries are listed in the following order:

First: America
Second: Britain, and between the two Israel which is the misnomer for the Jews
Third: France
Fourth: Germany
Fifth: Australia
Sixth: Canada
Seventh: Rest of NATO countries
Eighth: Russia
Ninth: India

And by way of example the assassination of president (Bush), minister of Defense (Rumsfeld), state secretary (Powell) and General (Tommy Franks) and Chief of intelligence (Tenet). However, this is not an exhaustive list it is intended only to illustrate and to clarify.""

12The final chapter, ""The Last Word"", contains the following headings:

""No solution without Jihad 

2 - Duties confirmed

The enlisting of the Fundamentalist movement

Small groups can cause havoc among Americans

Towards a Fundamental Base in the heart of the Muslim World

How and who should wage the clash?

Striking the Americans and the Jews

Taking the battle to the enemy

Selecting Targets and focusing on Martyr Operations

It is every Muslim's battle.""

13The section entitled ""Small groups can cause havoc among Americans"" contains the following:

""Pursuing Americans and Jews is not an impossible task. Killing them with a single shot, a stab or a pack of a popular mix or with an iron rod is not a difficult deed. Neither is burning their properties with a Molotov bottle. Small groups with small available means can cause horror to American and Jew alike.""

14According to the Crown, the first half of the e-book (Chapters 1 - 9) sets out the religious or ideological justifications for jihad and the second half (Chapters 10 - 13) provides a practical guide to achieving martyrdom and destroying those who oppose or oppress the Islamic faith. The Crown contended that the nature of the material contained in the e-book demonstrated that the preparation of the e-book was ""connected with"" assistance in a terrorist act. 

15There was no evidence capable of establishing that the appellant had any direct communications with prominent al-Qaeda members or with the authors of the adopted material in the e-book. However, the Crown case was that the evidence showed that during the relevant period, the appellant was an enthusiastic supporter of al-Qaeda and was keen to promote its ideals and practices. This evidence was said to be of relevance to count 1. The trial judge required the Crown to frame its case on that aspect on this limited basis. In particular, it could not submit that the appellant was an al-Qaeda member or had communicated directly with any of its prominent operatives.

THE DEFENCE AT THE TRIAL
16The appellant argued at his trial that the e-book was merely a compilation of various existing works, all of which were readily available for download from the Internet. Much of its content was uncontroversial. He emphasised that the first half contained historical justifications for jihad in Islam and the second half contained contemporary writings on the topic. It was submitted that the second half of the e-book could not be described as a ""terrorist manual"" as it did not provide concrete instructions as to how to commit acts of terrorism. The appellant emphasised that at the time at which the alleged offences occurred, he was an accredited journalist with an interest in religious affairs. 

AGREED FACTS
17The following matters were not in dispute: that the appellant made the e-book; that he downloaded the majority of its contents from various websites with the intention of compiling it into the e-book; that he caused it to be published on the Almaqdese website; that the e-book refers to methods of assassination and identifies targets for assassination; and that the appellant has a journalist's card and had contributed regularly to a publicly-available Islamic affairs magazine entitled ""Nida ul-Islam"" or ""The Call of Islam"" (""the magazine""). The magazine was published by the Islamic Youth Movement (""IYM"") and was freely available to the public. The appellant was largely responsible for its content.

GROUNDS OF APPEAL
18The grounds of appeal were expressed as follows:

CONVICTION
Ground 1 A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of her Honour failing to discharge the jury in circumstances in which counsel for the appellant had inadvertently tendered magazines, which made clear reference to material suggesting there was a link between al-Qaeda and the appellant;

Ground 2 Her Honour erred in directing the jury to disregard the submission made by counsel for the appellant during his closing address, in which he suggested that the jury should, when considering whether the book was connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act, take into account the delay by the authorities in seeking the removal of that book from availability at large;

Ground 3 Her Honour erred in directing the jury in relation to count 1 that the words ""connected with"" were simply to be given their ordinary meaning; and

Ground 4 Her Honour erred in holding that the appellant had failed to discharge the evidential burden provided for by s 101.5(5) of the Code, and in consequence declining to direct the jury that the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the document was intended to facilitate preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act.

SENTENCE
Ground 1 Her Honour erred in concluding that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""not far removed from the worst category of an offence under s 101.5(1) of the Code;

Ground 2 Her Honour erred in concluding that the appellant could not be regarded as a person of prior good character in light of various foreign convictions, even though these were obtained in violation of the principle of procedural fairness;

Ground 3 Her Honour erred in failing to give proper consideration to the question of deterrence; 

Ground 4 Her Honour erred in giving inadequate weight to the onerous conditions to which the appellant had been subject while on bail; and

Ground 5 The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

CONVICTION APPEAL
Ground 1 Failure to discharge the jury following inadvertent tender of magazines

19During the trial, the Crown called Dr Evan Kohlmann, who was accepted as an expert on international terrorism and terrorist organisations including al-Qaeda. His evidence was extensive, and included explanations of the operation and practices of al-Qaeda, concepts of jihad and martyrdom, the Almaqdese website, and the contents of the e-book. He was cross-examined by the appellant's counsel and asked about the appellant's prior journalistic publications, which included his work on the Nida ul-Islam magazine. The apparent purpose of the cross-examination was to establish that the e-book was, like the magazine, a journalistic work compiled for literary purposes. 

20During the cross-examination, Issue 9(1) of the magazine (Feb - Mar 2002) was tendered without objection. It became Exhibit 2. A bundle containing four other issues of the magazine was marked MFI 14. The prosecutor later called for the tender of MFI 14 which became Exhibit 4. A bundle containing 32 other issues of the magazine became Exhibit 5. The Crown had an opportunity to peruse Exhibit 5 overnight, apparently for the first time, those issues of the magazine having previously been with the jury. 

21Exhibit 5 included Issues 10(2) and 10(3) of the magazine. Within those issues were two articles written by the appellant which referred to allegations that the appellant had links to al-Qaeda and had assisted in the financing of overseas terrorist acts (""the allegations""). I will refer to the articles contained in issues 10(2) and 10(3) as ""the disputed articles"". 

22The disputed article in Issue 10(2) of the magazine was entitled ""Four Corners Missed the Target"". The article criticises a segment aired on the television program Four Corners on 9 June 2003. In that segment, Ms Sally Neighbour of the ABC referenced a ""secret CIA report"" which, she said, identified the appellant as the Australian head of al-Qaeda and as someone who had been trained in Afghanistan and who was involved in the planning of terrorist attacks overseas. The disputed article contains a comprehensive denial of the allegations and challenges the cogency of the claimed CIA intelligence. It reads, relevantly:

""For the record, Belal Khazal is a member of the IYM; he did not receive training of any kind in Afghanistan or elsewhere; he did not raise any funds for any organisations, and he did not, nor intend to, plan 'terrorist' attacks in the Philippines, Venezuela or anywhere else. 

Belal and other members of the IYM have been targeted because they are Muslims and they have been labelled as 'terrorists' by the likes of CIA, ASIO, and other security agencies.""

23The disputed article in Issue 10(3) of the magazine was entitled ""No Evidence: Just Fabrication against Bhelal Khazal."" That article, which concerned the same Four Corners segment, vehemently denied the allegations and argued that the CIA report was a fabrication. 

24The Crown sought to use the disputed articles for a limited purpose. It was the Crown's contention that the material, in conjunction with the evidence given by Dr Kohlmann, was capable of establishing that the appellant associated himself with al-Qaeda in the following ways: through his membership of the IYM (the publisher or the magazine), by contributing to the content of the magazine, and by selecting the Almaqdese website - which had been advertised in the magazine - as the forum for publication of the e-book. 

25The prosecutor urged the jury to exercise caution when considering the disputed articles. He said:

""One reason for drawing attention to this is: Please do not think, because the magazine itself contains an allegation in Four Corners by Sally Neighbour or anyone else against Mr Khazaal that you can act on that. We are submitting that you do not act on that. We did not tender exhibit 5. Care needs to be exercised. Merely because the ABC reports something that this is responding to - it is saying it is not right - merely because the ABC reports something, you cannot use that against Mr Khazaal. That is just a news report. Do you follow what I mean? I am sure you do. I think I have made the point.

They say: 'For the record, Bilal Khazaal is a member of the IYM, Islamic Youth movement.' The significance for the Crown is that this magazine records that Bilal Khazaal is a member of the IYM. Forget this allegation of Sally Neighbour. That is no part of the Crown case whatever against Mr Khazaal. But where the magazine is tendered in his case, it records that he is a member of the Islamic Youth Movement. The Crown submits it is fair of you to accept that.

The article goes on to say that Four Corners is completely wrong. My point is just to refer to this statement that he is a member of the Islamic Youth Movement.

At page 4 there is another defence of Bilal Khazaal. He is entitled to defend himself, if Four Corners has attacked him. This trial is not about what happened on the media, on television, or in a response. In this example, we did not put it in. Exercise care please, or there could be an unintended unfairness.

Finally today, if I may just very briefly refer to the last issue in exhibit 5, June to August 2004, again commencing at page 4, 'No evidence, just fabrication, against Bilal Khazaal.' We do not want you to take account of this kind of debate between the magazine and Four Corners or 60 Minutes in any part of your deliberations as to whether or not the Crown has proved these two charges beyond reasonable doubt. But we do draw your attention to the fact that in this edition it commences: 'It is now in the open. A member of the Lakemba based Islamic Youth Movement (IYM) Bilal Khazaal and his brother... lies and false accusations', et cetera.

Our point is that this magazine describes the accused as a member of the Islamic Youth Movement, and I will relate that to some evidence about him being involved in a publication, and hence assuming some responsibility for the content of those magazines.""

26In the course of the Crown address, counsel for the appellant, apparently for the first time, learnt of the content of the disputed articles. Concerned that a mistake had occurred and troubled by its impact on the jury, he made an application to have the jury discharged on the basis that the relevant articles were so devastating to the appellant that he was denied any possibility of a fair trial. Exhibit 5 had been in the jury's possession for seven hearing days by the time the application for discharge was made. When making the application, defence counsel said:

""Clearly, this material is devastating as far as the accused is concerned. The object here is to have a fair trial. We accept that the material has been put in by the defence. However, it has been put in in circumstances where, as a result of an oversight, this material was not picked up.

Our object in putting all of the material relating to these magazines was obvious. That is, the magazine is relevant to the proceedings. My friend suggests that there is a connection between the accused and the magazine, which we accept. It is, indeed, part of our case.

My friend goes further and says that there is a connection between this magazine and al-Qaeda based on the evidence of Dr Kohlmann. We accept the basis upon which that contention is made. However this material really goes to far and puts - - 

HER HONOUR: When you say 'this material', you are referring just to the two articles?

[Counsel for the appellant]: Yes. ...""

27The trial judge refused the application, concluding that the disputed articles categorically denied the allegations and accordingly, the potential for prejudice was minimised. Her Honour's judgment reads as follows:

""The perspective that jurors properly perform their tasks, are true to their oaths and comply with the trial judge's directions has been repeatedly applied in appellate courts over recent years; see R v Milat and R v Bell, R v Long and R v Richards [1999] NSW CCA 114, [1999] 107 ACrimR 318, R v Dudko, R v D'Arcy and R v Burrell.

I am not persuaded that the jury will fail to abide by the directions I have given and propose to give. In any event, the articles themselves rebut the allegations made in the programme. It may be the case that some members of the jury did see the programme when it aired in June 2003 and that the articles have only served to remind them of the allegations made therein. If that is so, then the Crown's reference to the articles does not add significantly to what those members of the jury already knew. 

Furthermore, it is not irrelevant that the magazines were tendered by the accused. Nothing in the magazines was thought to be so prejudicial that they could not be placed before the jury. For these reasons the application is refused."" 

28In her summing-up, the trial judge directed the jury in the following terms:

""There have also been references made in the course of the address to the Al-Nida magazine and to a Four Corners programme in 2004. Of course, the subject of that programme, which was the accused's alleged links to al-Qaeda and his alleged funding of terrorist acts, was strongly refuted by the accused throughout the magazine itself. The fact that such allegations have been made against the accused do not prove anything. We are all exposed to media coverage on a daily basis of many controversial events. It will not surprise you to hear that media outlets are fallible. They have been shown to be wrong in the past and they will be shown to be wrong in the future. As I have said a number of times in this trial, you must put these matters completely to one side and objectively consider the evidence brought against the accused on the specific charges in the indictment. He is not charged with being a terrorist. He is not charged with committing a terrorist act. There is no evidence that the accused is a member of al-Qaeda. There is no evidence that the accused communicated directly with any prominent member of al-Qaeda or any of the authors of the chapters of the book.

...

Now, there is no direct evidence, and I repeat this, ladies and gentlemen, of any links between the accused and al-Qaeda itself, but the Crown case is that an inference can be drawn, at the very least, that the accused was a supporter and an enthusiast of al-Qaeda.""

THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES
29The principles governing applications for the discharge of a jury and the review of that decision by an appellant court were summarised by Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Crofts v R [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427 as follows (at 440 - 441):

""No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues, the stage at which the mishap occurs, the deliberateness of the conduct, and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. ...[M]uch leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript.

Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable? 

...

[I]n the imperfect environment of the trial process, it is necessary to operate upon the assumption that a jury will be capable of conforming to judicial instruction to put particular evidence out of account.""

30See also Maric v R (1978) 20 ALR 513 per Gibbs J at 520; Stirland v DPP [1944] AC 315; [1944] 2 All ER 13 at 321; Driscoll v R (1977) 137 CLR 517; (1977) 15 ALR 47 at 69. 

APPELLANT'S SUBMISSIONS
31The appellant submitted that this Court could not conclude that but for the admission of the disputed material, the conviction was inevitable (Crofts at 440 - 441). 

32The appellant drew an analogy between the disputed articles and evidence of a defendant's prior convictions or bad character which, it was suggested, will normally jeopardise the prospects of a fair trial: R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 604 per Mason CJ and Toohey J, quoting Maxwell v DPP [1935] AC 309 at 317; Webb & Hay v R [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 90 per Toohey J. 

33The appellant argued that the revulsion with which acts of terrorism are regarded by members of the public and by the courts increased the risk of unfair prejudice (R v Wood [1996] 1 Cr App Rep 207 at 219A per Staughton LJ). This risk was said to be further elevated by Dr Kohlmann's evidence that the Internet was al-Qaeda's preferred means of communication. The appellant submitted that the jury could not avoid concluding that the contents of the e-book were published or at least endorsed by al-Qaeda and further, that the e-book was published on the Internet because that was the forum preferred by al-Qaeda. 

34The appellant emphasised that although there was no evidence establishing that the appellant had any direct links with al-Qaeda or with the authors of the material contained in the e-book, ""the material, to which the articles referred, effectively closed that gap, by asserting that the Appellant was a sponsor of, or participant in, terrorism.""

35The appellant did not agree that the risk of prejudice was minimised because he had used the magazine as a forum in which to deny the allegations. The appellant drew attention to a number of United States authorities which recognised the tendency on the part of juries to regard false or incorrect assertions as 'facts' notwithstanding their vehement denial by the witness (see, eg, Scheri v DePaolo 68 NJ Super 297, 172 A 2d 233; Ebron v United States 838 A.2d 1140 cf United States. v Pugh, 436 F.2d 222, 225 (C.A.D.C. 1970)). 

36It was submitted that the source of the material further elevated the risk of prejudice. Not only was material conveyed in a television program that was likely to be regarded by the jury as a reputable source of current affairs information (ABC v Comalco Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 510 at 520 per Smithers J); that material was said to have originated from governmental intelligence agencies including the CIA. The appellant submitted that the jury:
""might quite legitimately assume that such intelligence agencies would (or at the very least should) be aware of who is involved in terrorist activity. There is a particular danger when the prejudicial information is said to come from an authoritative source. See, e.g., R v. McCann (1991) 92 Cr.App.R. 239 per Beldam LJ...""

37According to the appellant, no direction was capable of curing the unavoidable prejudice caused by the introduction of the disputed articles. 

CROWN SUBMISSIONS
38The Crown asserted that the material was not so damaging as to require the discharge of the jury. It distinguished R v Halliday [2009] VSCA 195 (in which a document containing prior convictions was inadvertently put before the jury) and Pak v R [2000] WASCA 309 (in which evidence of bad character was inadvertently led in cross-examination) from the present case. It argued that it is ultimately for the trial judge to determine whether in the interests of a fair trial, there is a need for the jury's discharge (R v Hortis [2004] VSCA 143 per Nettle JA at [18], citing R v Boland (1974) VR 849 at 866; R v Vaitos (1981) 4 Crim App R 238 at 243 and R v George, Harris and Hilton (1987) 9 NSWLR 527 at 533). 

39The Crown submitted that the material contained in the disputed articles was of a different nature to evidence of a prior criminal record, bad character or antecedents. It was submitted that the material was evidence of the appellant's support for a terrorist group, a fact in issue which went to a core requirement of the offence, namely, that the appellant knew of the connection between the e-book and assistance in a terrorist act. It was submitted that:

""references to assertions of the Appellant's involvement in acts of terrorism which he chose to publish in a publicly available magazine in order to refute them are a far cry from inadmissible evidence of prior criminal acts, much less criminal acts of terrorism."" 

40The Crown argued that R v Wood involved prejudice of an entirely different order to that involved in the present case. The prejudice in that case was occasioned by ""constant press material during the course of the accused's trial for a terrorist offence [as well as] the trial judge's slanted summing up against the accused."" 

41It was argued that the trial judge's direction was sufficient to guard against the possibility that the jury, knowing that the charge related to terrorism, would attach undue significance to the material. There was a clear direction to:

""put completely to one side the allegations against the Appellant in the Four Corners program of links to al Qaeda and funding of terrorist acts, which he strongly refuted through the magazine itself, and [to] objectively consider the evidence brought against him on the specific charges in the indictment.""

42It was submitted that it was relevant that the appellant himself refuted the allegations. He was not merely ""attempting"" to refute them (as contended by the appellant) but refuting them in no uncertain terms. The submission reads: 

""The articles contain detailed arguments in support of their themes that the program and newspaper stories were untrue, unfair, unbalanced and calculated to inflame community passions against Australian Muslims, using the Appellant and his brother as the vehicle for the attack. The program and newspaper articles had plainly been widely disseminated in the community. The magazines containing the refutations were openly published and distributed. Each of the magazines is bilingual, containing an Arabic portion and an equivalent English portion. Rather than constitute irrefutable evidence of bad character of the kind exemplified in Crofts and Marec, they present the Appellant as the innocent victim of a malicious media campaign 'inciting hatred against Muslims in Australia' (close of first article)."" (emphasis in original)

43The Crown said that the United States authorities referred to by the appellant were not relevant as they concerned assertions put to witnesses in the course of cross-examination. Further, they did not take account of the principle recognised by Gleeson CJ in R v VPH (Unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 March 1994 at 7) that appellate courts in this country have no choice but to assume that juries understand and comply with the directions given to them by trial judges. 

44The Crown made a number of submissions in response to the appellant's assertion that the source of the material increased the potential for prejudice. First, it was said that Smithers J in ABC v Comalco was not suggesting at 520 that the ABC or its Four Corners program ""had any particular reputation for truth and accuracy in relation to the content of its programs."" Having reviewed the relevant portion of Smithers J's judgment, I would agree. Second, it was submitted that the appellant's reliance on R v McCann & Ors (1991) 92 Cr App R 239 was misplaced. That case concerned a government announcement, aired by the BBC at a critical stage of the trial, to the effect that the right to silence would be narrowed by legislation. The announcement attracted significant publicity and the support of Lord Denning, who stated publicly that the right to silence was a right exercised by the guilty. The trial judge's decision to refuse to discharge the jury was overturned on appeal. It was submitted by the Crown that ""nothing about the articles in question comes close to the extreme prejudice discussed in McCann."" 

45The Crown submitted that any unfair prejudice occasioned to the appellant as a result of the tender of the disputed articles was remedied in the trial judge's directions to the jury and accordingly that the present case is distinguishable from Crofts and Maric. 

DETERMINATION 
46The appellant's purpose in tendering the magazine was to demonstrate that the e-book was, like the magazine, a legitimate literary publication. The prosecutor sought to rely on the disputed articles as evidence that the appellant was a member of the IYM but urged the jury to disregard the allegations contained in the disputed articles. 

47The trial judge gave numerous directions in relation to the disputed articles. The jury was advised in clear terms that the appellant was not being tried for crimes of terrorism or for being a member of al-Qaeda. He was not accused of having any direct communications with al-Qaeda operatives. At its highest, the Crown case suggested that the appellant had been an al-Qaeda enthusiast. The jury was reminded of the fallibility of media outlets and of the fact that the allegations were strongly denied by the appellant in the disputed articles themselves.

48In my judgment the directions given by the trial judge were adequate to deal with the issues which had arisen. I am satisfied that the jury was made aware of the limited purpose for which the Crown relied on that evidence. The prosecutor and the trial judge took various opportunities to caution the jury against improper use of the disputed articles. The trial judge was alive to the atmosphere of the trial and to the disposition of the jury and was in the best position to assess whether the circumstances demanded the jury's discharge (El Hassan v R [2007] NSWCCA 148 per Hunt AJA at [15], citing House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505; Kanaan & Ors v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 at [50]; R v Ngo [2003] NSWCCA 82 at [49]; R v Ball (1960) 61 SR 37 at 41-42; see also GAR v R (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 164). I am not satisfied that the trial judge's refusal to discharge of the jury occasioned a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice (Crofts at 441). 

49The arguments ventilated in relation to this issue are illustrative of the tensions which have increasingly emerged between the unfair prejudice which may be occasioned to an accused when the jury receives information which it should not have had (whether in evidence or otherwise) and the jury's capacity to act on instruction given to it by the trial judge. If the assumption of the common law that jurors understand and follow the judge's instruction is to be more than hollow rhetoric it is important that appellate courts pay appropriate respect to the discretion of the trial judge who is in a far superior position to the appellate court to appreciate the atmosphere of the trial and determine whether appropriate instruction will ensure that the trial is fair.

50Although not adverted to by the trial judge, given the appellant's propensity for publishing material relating to jihad and apparent support for assassination it would hardly have come as a surprise to the jury that he was under suspicion from security authorities. It was an inevitable background to the charges which were laid by the Crown.

51I would dismiss this ground of appeal.

Ground 2 Alleged misdirection with respect to delay by authorities in seeking the removal of the book from the Almaqdese website 

52In his closing address, counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence clearly established that ASIO and the Australian Federal Police had delayed in procuring the removal of the e-book from the Internet. These agencies had known about the e-book when it was uploaded onto the Almaqdese website in September 2003 yet, according to the appellant, took no active steps to have it removed until May 2004. It was submitted that, given the delay, the jury was entitled to conclude that the elements of the charge were not made out. The trial transcript reads, relevantly:

""Authorities knew about it, you might think, within a reasonable time. Nothing was done. Nothing. This conduct said by the Crown to have posed such a terrorist threat didn't cause the authorities to act. What were they waiting for, the thing to happen? We know it never happened anyway. Or was it the case that the authorities really didn't think back then that it was the thing that they now claim it to be? Of course, we had the intervening - before the events in September/October '03 and the date of arrest in June of '04, almost a year later, we had the interviews, search of a home.

The Crown can only say in relation to the home, 'Well, look, we rely on the book. Our case is the book, the book, the book, the book. That's enough.' Or, what, is it not a legitimate point that when they raided the home they did so for a purpose? They did so, you might think, in the belief that something would be produced. And yet there is no evidence. They took the computer, they took a copy of the computer, went through the home. Not one piece of evidence to support the allegations that are made in this case.""

53In her Honour's summing-up, the trial judge directed the jury to disregard that portion of the appellant's closing address. Her Honour remarked:

""It would be wrong and perverse to assume, as [counsel for the appellant] invited you to do, that one explanation for the arrest of the accused some time after he first came to the notice of the authorities was that the prosecution was waiting for a terrorist act to be committed.

There is no evidence of that and, in fact, the evidence supports a completely different explanation, namely, that a careful translation of the document was necessary before the serious step of laying criminal charges could be taken...""

54Counsel for the appellant addressed her Honour on this direction in the absence of the jury. Her Honour quite rightly questioned how any delay on the part of the authorities could bear upon the jury's consideration of the elements of the charge. Counsel for the appellant responded as follows:

""Well, the imputation is - well, those in authority, who were dealing with this matter, may or may not themselves have perceived this material as being anything but advocacy.""

55The appellant now asserts that the trial judge misunderstood the appellant's submission. It is said that her Honour assumed that the evidence of the delay was being relied on as a form of opinion evidence to establish that the authorities did not believe that the appellant was guilty of the offence. The true purpose was said to be to demonstrate that the authorities did not consider the e-book to have posed a threat of imminent danger. As a result, it was said, the jury could not conclude that there was a connection between the e-book and assistance in a terrorist act as required by s 101.5(1)(b) the Code. If the jury was entitled to consider the evidence of Dr Kohlmann in determining that the e-book did pose an imminent threat, then it was also entitled to consider contrary evidence adduced by the appellant. 

56It was submitted that the trial judge's direction to the jury was ""particularly harmful"" to the appellant because it required the jury to ignore evidence favourable to him (that the e-book could not assist a potential terrorist) and because it personally criticised the appellant's trial counsel. 

57It was said that the jury's inability to reach a verdict in respect of Count 2 demonstrated that the evidence about the e-book's utility to a potential terrorist was critical, and that any contrary evidence was of fundamental importance to the appellant's defence to Count 1.

DETERMINATION
58As the Crown observes, no evidence was elicited at the trial to suggest that either ASIO or the Australian Federal Police had the means to compel the removal of the e-book from the Almaqdese website. In those circumstances, I doubt very much whether it could be said that the authorities ""delayed"" in procuring the removal of the e-book from the Internet. Leaving that to one side, the difficulty with the appellant's submission, even as rephrased or clarified, is the opinion evidence rule. As the Crown submitted:

""Just as an ASIO or AFP officer could not give admissible evidence that in his/her opinion the Appellant had not done anything wrong, the jury were not entitled to take into account in arriving at their verdict whether the authorities were of the opinion the book did not constitute an imminent danger and for that reason was not connected with assistance in a terrorist act."" (reference omitted)

59I do not accept the appellant's submission that he was ""entitled"" to adduce evidence that the e-book posed no imminent threat. Dr Kohlmann was the only witness to give evidence on the e-book's connection with assistance in a terrorist act. He was never asked whether the e-book posed a threat of imminent danger. I accept the Crown's submission that the Appellant's argument is underpinned by the incorrect proposition that a document which does not constitute an imminent danger is thereby not connected with assistance in a terrorist act.

60There being no evidence that the e-book posed a threat of imminent danger, it cannot be said that her Honour's direction removed from the jury's consideration ""evidence capable of supporting defence counsel's submission that the book was incapable of assisting a potential terrorist."" 

61I do not believe that her Honour's direction unduly criticised counsel. Nor is it appropriate to speculate upon the jury's reasoning process in relation to Count 2 and to extrapolate from that an inference that the ""evidence"" was improperly excluded from the jury's consideration in relation to Count 1. 

62This ground of appeal should be dismissed.

Ground 3 Alleged misdirection with respect to the words ""connected with""

63Section 101.5(1)(b) of the Code requires that the relevant document be ""connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act."" The Crown case proceeded on the basis that the e-book was ""connected with...assistance in a terrorist act."" 

64At the trial, the appellant's counsel sought a direction in the following terms: 

""The words 'connected with' mean that the book must itself have been capable of directly assisting in the commission of a terrorist act. A mere remote connection will not suffice.""

65The trial judge declined to direct the jury in those terms, instead directing that the words ""connected with"" be given their ordinary meaning. Her Honour told the jury:

""So, let me go to element (c). You will see that the focus of this element is on the connection between the document ... and assistance in an action or threat of action against certain persons. Now, this is an element that depends upon an examination of the contents of the document, nothing more, nothing less. We are only concerned about what the document says objectively. It is a matter for you to determine, because it is simply an objective factor, namely, is the document, connected with assistance in a terrorist act?

The phrase 'connected with assistance in an action or threat of action' has no special or technical meaning. You should interpret that phrase according to its plain English meaning. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any part of the document is connected with helping or facilitating the commission of an action or threat of action against any one of the persons that are set out in the particulars, then the Crown has proved that element of the offence.

It does not matter if the document is not connected with a specific action or threat of action, or if it is connected with more than one action or threat of action. As long as the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the document is connected with an action or threat of action of the kind specified in the charge, that is sufficient to prove this element.""

66The appellant modified his position on appeal. It was said that the jury should have been directed that, before the necessary connection could exist, the e-book must have factually and appreciably furthered the commission of a terrorist act, making it ""more likely"" to take place. 

67The appellant's counsel filed supplementary submissions which appear to qualify this modified position. The supplementary submissions read:

""Whether or not the jury should have been told they had to treat the words in the way suggested by the appellant's counsel ... they should at least have been directed that more than a remote connection was required.""

68It seems that the appellant no longer claimed that a positive definition of the phrase ""connected with"" was required (whether in the terms originally advanced or as put on appeal). As I understand it, the appellant now simply contends that the jury should have been told that more than a remote or tenuous connection was required. 

69The appellant submitted that the words ""connected with"" did not have a plain English meaning that was ""appropriate to all occasions"". Accordingly, a restrictive interpretation was necessary to avoid latent ambiguity (Beckwith v R (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576; Arnold v R (1993) NSWLR 73 at 86 - 87 per Abadee J). 

70Reference was made to the remarks of Spigelman CJ in R v Orcher [1999] NSWCCA 356; (1999) 48 NSWLR 273 at [28] where the Chief Justice said:
""The phrase 'in connection with' is capable of considerable breadth, however it always takes its colour from its surroundings. The full scope of the dictionary definition is rarely, if ever, appropriate.""

71It was submitted that the ""highly penal"" statutory context in which the phrase appears (R v Novakovic [2007] VSCA 145; (2007) 172 A Crim R 414 per Ashley JA at [59]; citing Murdoch v Simmonds [1971] VR 887 per Adam J at 889) demands a more confined interpretation. The appellant cited the remarks of Hall J in Halpin v Department of Gaming and Racing (2006) 68 NSWLR 211 at [47] (""where provisions creating or extending criminal liability can reasonably be construed in two or more ways, they are to be given the narrowest of the alternative interpretations""). 

72Reference was made to the decision in R v Zafar [2008] QB 810 which concerned an offence under s 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (UK) (the equivalent of s 101.4 of the Code), which reads:

""A person commits an offence if he possesses an article in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that his possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism."" (emphasis added)

73Lord Phillips CJ observed at [28] - [29] that considerations of certainty required that the phrase ""for a purpose connected with"" be defined narrowly. That approach was endorsed by Lord Osborne in Siddique (Mohammed Atif) v HM Advocate [2010] HCJAC, in which it was held that the phrase ""in connection with"" ""requires a direct connection between the object possessed and the act of terrorism"" (at [82]). 

74Following the hearing of oral argument the court drew the parties attention to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Benbrika & Ors v R [2010] VSCA 281. That case was concerned with an alleged breach of s 101.4 of the Criminal Code. The issue considered by the Court of Appeal was concerned with the direction to be given to the jury when a person is charged with possessing a ""thing"" which is ""connected with preparation for a terrorist act.""

75No application was made to amend the grounds of appeal in the present case. 

76The appellant submitted that Benbrika decided that before Benbrika could be convicted three requirements must be proved. Firstly, there must be a terrorist act which is either proposed or contemplated, secondly some activity which assists that act and the thing must be intended to be used in aid or as part of that assistance.

77It was further submitted that the ""connection"" contemplated in the section was informed by the intention or purpose of the person which existed at the time the thing was possessed.

78The appellant submitted that Benbrika was an authority which this Court should accept to be binding and which provided the approach which this Court should take to s 101.5.

CROWN SUBMISSIONS
79The Crown did not accept the appellant's assertion that the plain English meaning of ""connected with"" is so broad as to require some restriction in the context of the Act. 

80It was submitted that the true significance of Orcher lay in affirming that the meaning of phrases such as ""in connection with"" is heavily context-dependent: per Spigelman CJ at [30], quoting with approval Burswood Management Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth) (1990) 23 FCR 144 at 146 (""The words 'in connection with' are words of wide import and the meaning to be attributed to them depends on their context and the purpose of the statute in which they appear""). Reference was also made to the remarks of Davies J in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487. His Honour remarked at 491 that the words ""in connection with"" and similar phrases (e.g. ""relating to"", ""in respect of"") are likely to vary in meaning from statute to statute, and although theoretically capable of wide import, their meaning is generally confined by the context in which they appear. 

81The authorities which restricted the meaning of ""for a purpose connected with"" in the context of s 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (UK) were of no value. The offence under s 57 (possession for terrorist purpose) permits guilt to be proved on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that the possession is connected to the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. Accordingly, it is unsurprising that s 57 was interpreted to require a direct connection between the object possessed and the terrorist act. 

82The Crown drew attention to the decision of R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 691 which also concerned an offence under s 101.5(1) of the Code. The offender had collected maps which were intended to be used in the preparation for a bombing of Australia's electricity supply system. Whealy J directed the jury in the following terms:

""The words 'in connection with the preparation for an action or threat of action' really underline that we are concerned with actions taken, for example the collection of documents, where the documents themselves are connected with preparation taken towards the implementation, and hence in advance, of the projected act. Now, in relation to that, you need to understand that the concept of preparation requires proof of something intended to advance the implementation of the projected terrorist act.""

83It was submitted that the directions given by the trial judge in the present case accorded with those given by his Honour in Lodhi. 

84In its supplementary submissions, the Crown argued that the trial judge's directions relating to knowledge prevented the jury from acting on a remote connection. Those directions were in the following terms:

""The elements of the offences, which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt, are as follows:-

Count 1

...

(e) The accused knew (that is, he was aware) at the time he made the document, of the connection between the document and assistance in the action, or threat of action, referred to in (c), that is:

i) he was aware of the action, or threat of action, referred to in (c) ; and

ii) he was aware of the intention by that action, or threat of action, to advance a political, religious or ideological cause, namely, the advancement of the Muslim religion in the world, including the dominance of that religion in Arabia as defined in the document and/or the establishment of a Muslim nation in that region and/or the expulsion of Jews, Christian and other non-Muslims from that region ; and

iii) he was aware, by that action or threat of action, it was intended to coerce or influence by intimidation one or more of the following - the Government of the Commonwealth, the government of a foreign country, or to intimidate the public or a section of the public ; and

iv) he was aware that the action or threat of action, if carried out, would cause serious physical harm to a person; or serious damage to property; or a person's death; or endanger a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public; and

v) he was aware that the action or threat of action was not advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action OR he was aware that the action or threat of action was intended to cause serious physical harm to a person; or a person's death; or was intended to endanger a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or was intended to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.""

85It was said those directions ""necessarily excluded the possibility of a conviction based on an indirect or remote connection"" and accordingly there was no need for the direction which the appellant argues was required.

86Finally it was submitted that this Court should apply the proviso in the event that error was found with respect to the directions given by the trial judge.

DETERMINATION
87The initial question is whether the trial judge was required to direct the jury that more than a remote or tenuous connection between the e-book and the relevant assistance was required.

88Section 101.5 of the Code creates a serious criminal offence punishable by a maximum of 15 years imprisonment. The offence falls within Part 5.3 of the Code. Part 5.3 was originally inserted into the Code by the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 (Cth). The second reading speech to that Act reads, relevantly:

""No country has ever been immune to the threat of terrorism. While there is no known specific threat of terrorism in Australia at present, we must ensure that we are as well prepared as possible to deal with the new international security environment. Terrorist forces, through violent and intimidatory methods, are actively working to undermine democracy and the rights of people throughout the world. 

We must direct all available resources, including the might of the law, at protecting our community and ensuring that those responsible for threatening our security are brought to justice. And we must do so as swiftly as possible. The Howard Government emphatically rejects any suggestion that because we have not experienced any direct terrorist threat in Australia since September 11 this package of legislation is not justified or is an over-reaction. We are actively involved in the war against terrorism. We cannot assume that we are not at risk of a terrorist attack. We cannot afford to become complacent. And we should never forget the devastation of September 11. The Howard Government takes very seriously the responsibility to protect Australia against terrorism. We will be seeking to bring this important package of legislation on for debate as soon as possible.""

89The significance of the events leading to the enactment of Part 5.3 cannot be overstated. The explanatory memoranda to Part 5.3 make plain that the legislative intention underpinning that Part is to eradicate the threat and occurrence of terrorist acts in Australia. Although there is no ""purpose clause"" specific to Part 5.3, Parliament's intention in enacting the offence under s 101.5(1) of the Code is discernable from s 100.4 (which extends Part 5.3 to preliminary acts that concern terrorist acts but are not in themselves terrorist acts) and from s 100.6 (which preserves the operation of State and Territory laws). That Part 5.3 was intended to operate expansively gains support from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Lodhi v R [2006] NSWCCA 121; (2006) 199 FLR 303 at [66]:

""Preparatory acts are not often made into criminal offences. The particular nature of terrorism has resulted in a special, and in many ways unique, legislative regime. It was, in my opinion, the clear intention of Parliament to create offences where an offender has not decided precisely what he or she intends to do. A policy judgment has been made that the prevention of terrorism requires criminal responsibility to arise at an earlier stage than is usually the case for other kinds of criminal conduct, e.g. well before an agreement has been reached for a conspiracy charge. The courts must respect that legislative policy.""

90That same legislative policy is found in s 101.5(3)(b) of the Code, which reads:

""A person commits an offence under subsection (1) or (2) even if ... the document is not connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a specific terrorist act...""

91The question is not whether the words ""connected with"" give rise to ambiguity, but whether the words ""the document is connected with ... assistance in a terrorist act"" give rise to ambiguity. As the Victorian Court of Appeal said in Benbrika at [323], ""it is erroneous to construe the words 'connected with' in isolation from their context."" 

92A connection can exist between innumerable things and occur in almost innumerable ways. Whether the e-book was connected with assistance in a terrorist act was a question of fact for the jury, applying its understanding of the relevant words. 

93The appellant argued that the trial judge should have imposed a qualification on the words of the statute so that the jury were instructed that ""more than a remote connection was required."" I do not accept the submission. The words in ""connection with"" are ordinary words which the jury were obviously capable of understanding. I accept that the connection must be more than ephemeral but I see no reason why the jury should have been given a judicial gloss on the words used by the legislature. There is nothing in the legislation to suggest that the jury should be required to do other than apply their ordinary understanding of the words ""connected with"" to the fact finding required of them. If they consider the alleged connection to be ephemeral or so remote that it could not be described as ""connected with"" the relevant assistance, they would respond accordingly. 

94Benbrika was concerned, inter alia, with an offence under s 101.4(1) of the Code, which reads:

""101.4 Possessing things connected with terrorist acts 

(1) A person commits an offence if: 

(a) the person possesses a thing; and 

(b) the thing is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act; and 

(c) the person mentioned in paragraph (a) knows of the connection described in paragraph (b).""

95The charge in Benbrika related to the possession of a ""thing"" being a compact disc containing extremist literature, videos and images (""the Mansura CD""). Copies of the Mansura CD were found at two of the accused's premises. The trial judge directed the jury in the following terms:

""The second thing that the Crown has to prove is that the [Mansura] compact disc was connected with preparation for a terrorist act.

In the context of this case, what that means is that the compact disc had some sort of connection to, or relationship with, a terrorist act, and, in the circumstances of this case, that means no more than that if you were satisfied that the organisation of which Benbrika was a member, if you found that he was a member, was engaged in fostering or preparing a terrorist act, that terrorist act, whatever it was, would be sufficient to found that connection if you thought that something on the CD was connected with a terrorist act. 'Connected with' is a very wide phrase. It does not mean connected with in any particular way. There just has to be some connection between the thing and a terrorist act (Court of Appeal's emphasis).""

96A question on appeal was whether a ""direct connection"" between the Mansura CD and preparation for a terrorist act was required. The Court of Appeal (Maxwell P, Nettle and Weinberg JJA) said:

[324] The question is not, as the English cases suggest, whether there is a direct connection between the thing and the act of preparation. It is rather whether the connection, as manifested in all the circumstances of the case, is sufficiently tangible to fall, properly and sensibly, within the meaning of the term 'connected with'. The possession of innocuous and everyday items, such as a cheque book, even one intended to be used, as one of its purposes, for a nefarious end, is not sufficient, in our view, to meet the statutory requirement. ... (references omitted).""

97I respectfully agree with this approach and adopt it in relation to the question in the present appeal. 

98There was a particular problem in Benbrika which is not present in the present case. Because the relevant thing was an inanimate object Benbrika's possession of it may have been innocuous. The thing alone could not determine whether there was the relevant connection. For this reason the court said that before Benbrika could be found to have committed an offence against the statute there had to be a terrorist act for which preparatory activity was, at least, in contemplation [338]. Once this was recognised the problem with the trial judge's direction becomes apparent.

99The trial judge directed the jury that ""connected with"" was:

""a very wide phrase. It does not mean connected with in any particular way. There just has to be some connection between the thing and a terrorist act.""

100The omission which caused the problem was the failure to refer to ""preparation"" for the terrorist act which informed the nature of the required connection. The Court of Appeal identified the problem and said:

""Used in s 101.4(1) the phrase does have a particular meaning. It means that the thing must be shown to have been 'connected' with preparation for a terrorist act' by virtue of some person's having had the purpose of using the thing in, or in aid of, preparation for the terrorist act.""

101In the present case the appellant was charged with making a ""document connected with assistance in a terrorist act."" The connection which the prosecution identified was said to be found within the document itself which described methods of assassination, being terrorist acts, organisation of effective assassination teams and identified prospective targets for assassination. There was more but this is sufficient to identify the fact that the document itself described a variety of terrorist acts from which the jury could conclude that the document was connected with assistance in a terrorist act. They were the acts contemplated by the appellant (Benbrika [338]). Proof of a specific terrorist act was not required.

102The trial judge took a different approach to the trial judge in Benbrika. Her Honour told the jury that the phrase ""connected with assistance in an action or threat of action"" has no special or technical meaning. She directed their attention to the particulars saying:

""If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any part of the document is connected with helping or facilitating the commission of an action or threat of action against anyone of the persons that are set out in the particulars, then the Crown has proved that element of the offence.""

103The particulars identified persons including diplomats, military personnel and holders of public office. Her Honour continued:

""It does not matter if the document is not connected with a specific action or threat of action, or if it is connected with more than one action or threat of action. As long as the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the document is connected with an action or threat of action of the kind specified in the charge, that is sufficient to prove this element."" 

104By taking this course her Honour, as was appropriate, confined the jury's deliberation to the issues raised at the trial and directed the jury's attention to the content of the document which the appellant was proved to have created. Her Honour's direction was faithful to the words of the section and placed the words ""in connection with"" in their appropriate context. Her Honour did not, as occurred in Benbrika, place any gloss on those words. The jury were not invited to act upon ""some connection"" or a ""remote connection."" They were instructed to look at the document and determine from the document whether the Crown had proved the relevant connection.

105I would dismiss this ground of appeal.

Ground 4 Alleged error with respect to the application of s 101.5(5) of the Code

106There are two fault elements for the offence constituting count 1 on the indictment. The first is that the appellant intentionally made the document. The second is that he knew that the document was connected with assistance in a terrorist act. Section 101.5(5) (para [2] above) provides a possible defence. It provides, inter alia, that s 101.5(1) will not apply if ""the document was not intended to facilitate preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act."" The defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the defence. Section 13.3(3) is in the following terms:

""A defendant who wishes to rely on any exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification in relation to an offence bears the evidential burden in relation to that matter.""

107Section 13.3(6) further provides:

""(6) In this Code:

evidential burden, in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist.""

108Whether the evidential burden has been satisfied is a question of law (s 13.3(5)). If a defendant discharges that burden, the prosecution must then disprove it beyond reasonable doubt. Sections 13.1(2) and (3) provide:

""(2) The prosecution also bears a legal burden of disproving any matter in relation to which the defendant has discharged an evidential burden of proof imposed on the defendant. 

(3) In this Code: 

'legal burden', in relation to a matter, means the burden of proving the existence of the matter.""

109At the trial, counsel for the appellant made an application for a direction in the following terms: 

""If there is a reasonable possibility that the appellant did not make the book with the intention of facilitating assistance in a terrorist act, then the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the making of the book was intended to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act.""

110Counsel for the appellant drew the trial judge's attention to evidence which, he submitted, supported the relevant inference. Her Honour ruled that the defence had not been engaged or, if it had, that the appellant had not discharged his evidentiary burden. 

111As to the issue of engagement, her Honour remarked:

""When pressed to explain what was to be submitted to the jury as to the accused's intention in making the book, the answer was, and I quote, 'The accused intended to support the Islamic religion by compiling a reference book containing the views of authors concerning the role and rules of Jihad in the Islamic religion.' That was later amended by the addition of the words 'by lawful means' after the word 'intended'. That adds nothing to the submission but merely restates that the accused denies liability. ...

However, ultimately the only direction sought by Mr Thomas and Mr Lange is that outlined at paragraph 2 of these reasons. It was submitted that no other direction was necessary. The reluctance to express the accused's case in terms of what he intended as opposed to what he did not intend exposes the flaw in the accused's submission that section 101.5(5) applies in the circumstances of this trial.

... Whilst it is true that section 101.5(5) states that liability is avoided where there is no intention to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act, the note to the subsection refers to 'the matter' in subs 5 and to section 13.3(3). 

The latter provision and section 13.3(6) make it clear that, 'An exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification,' is 'the matter' and that its existence or non-existence may be suggested as a reasonable possibility by the evidence relied upon to discharge the burden. It is also clear that a fault element is not a matter; see section 13.1(1) and (2). 

It is therefore difficult to accept the proposition that the matter relied upon by the accused as the exception is, in effect, the fault element which the Crown must negative beyond reasonable doubt.""

112Her Honour then addressed the sufficiency of the evidence said to suggest an absence of intention. Her Honour's reasons read, relevantly:

""In the case of an offence under section 101.5, subs 5 contemplates the advancement of a defence by adducing or pointing to evidence which suggests the reasonable possibility that the defendant did not intend to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act.

Whilst the threshold for the discharge of the evidentiary burden is relatively low, in that the evidence taken at its highest need only be suggestive of the possibility of the absence of intention, it is not sufficient that it is a mere possibility.

The example proffered by the Crown of such a defence, and one that was a real point of discussion and debate in the formulation of the offence, is the terrorism consultant or adviser to government or law enforcement agencies, who collects and collates material advocating the commission of terrorist acts in the course of his or her employment. Whilst technically guilty of an offence under section 101.5, the fact of the person's employment status and duties suggest a reasonable possibility that he or she made such a document without any intention to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. ...

These factors ... are inconsistent with an intention to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. 

The accused's status as a journalist and researcher is not of the same character. His occupation as a journalist and the circumstances under which he made the book, namely, at short notice at the behest of 'the brothers', are not objectively inconsistent with an intention to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. As I have already observed, in the absence of any evidence from the accused, his counsel sought to rely upon various categories of evidence in the trial from which the inference might reasonably be drawn that the accused did not intend to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. It is not necessary to set out in detail that evidence save to say that the Crown relies upon precisely the same evidence to prove the book's connection with assistance in a terrorist act and the accused's knowledge of that connection. 

Herein lies the paradox inherent in the accused's application to leave subs 5 to the jury. The accused proposes to submit to the jury that the evidence in the trial would not allow them to draw the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew of the book's connection with assistance in a terrorist act and, in the event that those submissions fail, rely on the same evidence as suggestive of a reasonable possibility that the accused did not intend facilitating assistance in a terrorist act. The effect is to put the Crown to proof on a fault element that does not form part of the offence.""

APPELLANT'S SUBMISSIONS
113The appellant's submissions to this Court were concerned with the issue of the evidence necessary to discharge the evidential burden. They do not appear to address her Honour's finding that the defence was not engaged. 

114The appellant submitted that the evidential burden only required him to point to evidence suggesting a reasonable possibility that ""the matter"" did or did not exist (s 13.3(6)). It was said that her Honour erred in requiring the appellant to point to evidence that was inconsistent with an intention to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. This was said to have imposed a legal rather than evidential burden. In other words, instead of assessing whether the evidence left the defence open, her Honour considered whether the defence would succeed.

115The appellant submitted that proof of a negative state of affairs (that the appellant lacked a particular intention) required ""slender evidence"" (Jeffrey v DPP (1995) 121 FLR 16; (1995) 79 A Crim R 514 at 518; Fowkes v DPP [1997] 2 VR 506; (1996) 88 A Crim R 166 at 512; Brauer v DPP [1991] 2 Qd R 261; (1989) 45 A Crim R 109 at 113). It was not possible for the appellant to entirely exclude the possibility that he intended the e-book to facilitate the assistance of a terrorist act. What mattered was:

""whether the accused can point to evidence, or some factual thing, which suggests a reasonable possibility that his purpose was one other than that criminalised by the section.""

116It was submitted that the appellant was not required to point to evidence suggesting that he made the e-book for a purpose other than to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. He merely had to point to evidence suggesting a reasonable possibility that his intention in making the e-book was to assist in educating others about jihad (Texas Department of Community Affairs v Burdine 450 US 248, 101 S. Ct 1089 and Board of Trustees of Keene State College v Sweeney 439 US 24, 99 S. Ct 295). It was said that that was what the appellant did. He pointed to his previous work as an accredited journalist, which included his work on the magazine. He also pointed to the e-book itself, which he said merely collated various works on the topic of jihad. Some of the writings were centuries old and written in script that would not be readily comprehensible to speakers of modern Arabic. 

117It did not matter that the evidence was the same as that relied on by the Crown in its case. Section 13.3(4) makes it clear that ""the defendant no longer bears the evidential burden in relation to a matter if evidence sufficient to discharge the burden is adduced by the prosecution or by the court."" 

118According to the appellant, the evidential burden had been discharged and it was for the Crown to rebut the defence by proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. 

CROWN SUBMISSIONS
119The Crown submitted that the trial judge was correct to find that the defence had not been engaged.

120The Crown accepted the appellant's formulation of the relevant test and agreed that it imposed a low threshold. Nevertheless, it was submitted that the evidence pointed to by the appellant did not satisfy that threshold. 

121The trial judge could not be said to have imposed a legal burden upon the appellant. Her Honour did not require the appellant to point to evidence which necessarily excluded the incriminating intention. 

122The Crown accepted that if the appellant discharged its evidential burden, the prosecution was required to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the defence did not apply. What the Crown was required to negative was not, as the appellant submitted, the fault element (that the appellant did not intend to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act) but rather, the defence. The submission reads:

""[The appellant's] position was that the evidence he identified as not permitting the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew of the book's connection with assistance in a terrorist act could also be relied on, if the jury were so satisfied, as evidence suggestive of a reasonable possibility that he did not intend facilitating assistance in a terrorist act. Had this been permitted the effect would have been to require the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt a fault element not forming part of the count 1 offence.""

123The Crown then turned to the authorities cited by the appellant which concerned the extent of evidence required to prove a negative state of affairs. In Jeffrey, the appellant was required to prove that certain property ""was not used in, or in connection with any unlawful activity and was not derived, directly or indirectly, by any person from any unlawful activity"". Cole JA remarked at 518 that ""[d]epending on the circumstances of each particular case, 'slender evidence may suffice to satisfy an evidential burden in relation to a negative state of affairs'"" (footnote omitted). The Crown submitted that Cole JA's qualification was significant. Brauer was distinguished on the basis that the party upon whom the evidential burden was placed had limited means to produce the required evidence. 

124In the Crown's view, the trial judge was correct to find that the threshold requirement of ""slender evidence"" required more than a mere possibility of the relevant matter. None of the evidence identified by the appellant went beyond a mere possibility that ""in making the book knowing it was connected with assistance in a terrorist act the Appellant did not intend to facilitate such assistance."" Any evidence of his scholarly intention was, in the submission of the Crown, equally consistent with a guilty intention to support Islam by terrorist means. 

DETERMINATION
125It is unnecessary to resolve the issues surrounding the direction suggested by the appellant. However, it confuses the role of the judge in deciding the threshold question and that of the jury if the threshold question is decided by the judge in the appellant's favour. 

126It is also unnecessary to resolve the argument in relation to her Honour's analysis of the inter relation between s 101.5(1) and (2). However, evidence relevant to the evidential burden in ss (5) must, if the burden is discharged, be given consideration by the jury when determining whether an offence has been committed.

127The appellant identified four aspects of the evidence which it was submitted justified a finding that the evidentiary burden in s 13.3(6) was discharged. They included the fact that the appellant was an accredited journalist, a researcher and publisher, the fact that he had acquired and built up a library which he used in his research, he had a significant interest in the Islamic religion and had written and published articles on benign Islamic issues.

128Whatever be the difficulties with her Honour's approach to the legislative provision I am satisfied that this evidence was insufficient to discharge the evidentiary burden which fell upon the appellant. To discharge that burden the appellant had to point to evidence that suggested a ""reasonable possibility"" that the making of the particular document was not intended to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act. The evidence to which attention was drawn was entirely neutral in relation to that issue. Whether or not the appellant was a journalist who had researched and published in relation to Islam it was his intention in making the document which was the issue in the trial. On that issue, apart from the document itself, without the appellant giving evidence or there being other evidence from which his intention could be inferred the evidential burden could not be discharged. There was nothing to support a reasonable possibility that he did not have the relevant intention.

129I would dismiss this ground of appeal.

130Since preparing my judgment I have become aware of the decision of the High Court in Braysich v The Queen [2011] HCA 14. In that case the majority said:

""If a trial judge has to consider whether, at the close of the evidence in a criminal trial, a particular defence should be left to the jury, the question which the trial judge will have to ask himself or herself will be: 

1. In a case where the legal burden is on the prosecution and the evidential burden on the accused - is there evidence which, taken at its highest in favour of the accused, could lead a reasonable jury, properly instructed, to have a reasonable doubt that each of the elements of the defence had been negatived? 

2. In a case in which both the legal burden and the evidential burden rest upon the accused - is there evidence which, taken at its highest in favour of the accused, could lead a reasonable jury, properly instructed, to conclude on the balance of probabilities that the defence had been established?

It is the latter question which should have been asked in this case at trial. It can be reframed by reference to s 998(6) into an inquiry whether there was evidence from which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that it was more likely than not that the appellant lacked the proscribed purpose. Put another way - was there evidence from which the jury could conclude that it was unlikely, in the sense of improbable, that the appellant had the proscribed purpose?""

131As I understand the position nothing I have written is inconsistent with the approach to the resolution of this ground of appeal favoured by the majority. Relevant observations are also made by Haydon J [57] and Bell J [101] although their Honours were in the minority.

""INCONSISTENT"" VERDICTS
132The appellant made a further complaint which, although not articulated as a ground of appeal, is said to be relevant to the conviction appeal. In essence the appellant contended that the jury's inability to reach a verdict in relation to Count 2 calls into question its verdict in relation to Count 1. For Count 2 to have been established, the jury was required to be satisfied that the appellant intended that the offence alleged to have been incited would be committed: s 11.4(2). It was submitted that the jury's failure to find that the appellant intended to bring about an act of terrorism, or that he was aware that an act of terrorism would occur in the ordinary course of events (s 5.2(3)) was inconsistent with its finding, in relation to Count 1, that the e-book was connected with assistance in a terrorist act. The appellant submitted that:

""If the Appellant had been aware that the document would, in the ordinary course of events, be connected with, in a direct and meaningful sense, any of these actions, the Appellant must necessarily also be said to have meant to bring about the commission of a terrorist act, or at the very least been aware that a terrorist act would be committed in the ordinary course of events. Each of these actions is, after all, a preliminary, and, indeed, necessary step to the commission of a terrorist act, where the author of the document is not the person committing the terrorist act. However, the jury's inability to reach a verdict in respect of count 2 demonstrates a contrary belief ... [namely that] the connection between the document and the actions is no more than tenuous."" 

133I reject this submission. As the Crown observed, the jury's inability to reach a verdict on Count 2 cannot be translated into a de facto verdict of not guilty. There is no necessary overlap between the element of knowledge in Count 1 and the element of intention in Count 2. It was open to the jury to find that the appellant knew that the document was connected to assistance in a terrorist act but not that the appellant intended to bring about an act of terrorism. This submission is without merit.

THE PROVISO
134The Crown submitted that even if one or more grounds of appeal are upheld, the present case is suitable for the application of the proviso (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s 6(1)). I agree.

135The appellant compiled and published a lengthy document advocating the ruthless slaughter of innocent persons in the name of religion. He described the e-book as ""urging for jihad"", an entirely accurate description. The document contained detailed descriptions of the methods by which those assassinations could be carried out and identified particular groups and individuals as appropriate targets of assassination. Although primarily written by others the appellant adopted the text and endorsed its content. 

136To my mind, accepting the approach I have endorsed to the construction of s 101.5(1) the Crown case was overwhelming. Even if the trial judge committed any of the errors asserted by the appellant, no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. The prosecution case was dependent upon both the content of the document and its method and place of publication. The connection with assistance in a terrorist act was obvious from the document as was the appellant's knowledge of that connection and his intention in publishing.

THE SENTENCE APPEAL

Ground 1 Alleged error in assessment of objective seriousness

137Her Honour commenced her consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence by considering the legislative policy underpinning Part 5.3 of the Code (which I have related above at [80] - [82]) and the remarks of Spigelman CJ in Lodhi concerning the need for condign punishment for terrorism offences. Her Honour observed at [11]:

""The dissemination of extremist literature, connected or unconnected with a terrorist plot, is caught by the legislative scheme, no doubt because literature of the type sourced by the prisoner is capable of, and has been shown to, foment terrorist activity.""

138At the sentence hearing, counsel for the appellant submitted that the jury's failure to reach a verdict in relation to Count 2 justified a submission that although the appellant knew of the connection between the e-book and assistance in a terrorist act, he did not intend to incite the commission of an act of terrorism. This, in turn, was said to reduce the objective seriousness of the offence to ""the lowest end of the spectrum."" Her Honour disagreed, remarking that intention was not an element of the Count 1 charge. Although its presence may aggravate the offence, its absence could not be a matter in mitigation (at [14]). 

139Her Honour regarded it as significant that the e-book was published on the Internet, observing (at [15]):

""[15] ... In circumstances where material of this nature is published on an internet site, chosen by the prisoner because of its connection with adherents of violent struggle against the enemies of Islam, allowing for almost instantaneous and international distribution, the Crown may never be in a position to bring forward evidence of the identity or numbers of people who read the document, or whether they are influenced by its contents to commit terrorist acts. That is precisely why the gravamen of the offence lies in the construction of a document likely to facilitate a terrorist act, whether or not such an act occurs.""

140The sentencing judge took into account the substantial ""volume, detail and accuracy"" of the content of the e-book (at [19]). Her Honour accepted the Crown's description of the second half of the e-book as a ""terrorist training manual"" and noted the extent of harm that would be caused should the matters urged therein be carried through to completion (at [20]).

141Her Honour concluded that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""not far removed from the worst category"" for offences under s 101.5(1) of the Code (at [21]). In the appellant's view, this conclusion was ""extraordinary"". 

142The appellant argued that her Honour's refusal to take into account intention when considering Count 1 ""entirely disregard[ed] the factual matrix underlying the charges."" He submitted:

""Count 1 charged the Appellant with having compiled a document. In respect of count 2, the Crown alleged that the Appellant attempted to incite the commission of terrorist acts. The incitement was to be seen in the compilation and posting of the document. Accordingly, the intentions underlying counts 1 and 2 must have been identical. If the intention was lacking in respect of count 2, it must similarly have been lacking in respect of count 1.""

143The appellant accepted that the jury's inability to reach a verdict on Count 2 did not definitively prove that the appellant lacked an intention to incite an act of terrorism. However, it was said that it meant that that the sentencing judge could not sentence the appellant for Count 1 on the basis that he did intend to incite an act of terrorism. Because the objective criminality of the offence could not be assessed without regard to the offender's intention, the trial judge's inability to find that the appellant intended to incite an act of terrorism should have considerably reduced the objective criminality of the offending.

144It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred in classifying the second half of the e-book as a terrorist manual. It was ""entirely devoid of detail...provid[ing] no effective guidance as to how to put ideas into practice"". It could not be viewed as the most reprehensible form of document contemplated by the offence.

145It was further submitted that it was wrong for her Honour to conclude that ""the nature and extent of the publication of the document... was designed to maximise the speed and the reach of the dissemination of the document."" Although publishing a document on the Internet may facilitate its distribution, there was no admissible evidence establishing that the appellant caused the e-book to be published online in order to maximise its impact. Further, there was no evidence that the appellant took any additional steps to facilitate the dissemination of the e-book once it had been published on the Almaqdese website.

146The Crown submitted that the jury's failure to reach a verdict on Count 2 did not suggest that the appellant lacked an intention to incite a terrorist act. Further, the elements of the Count 2 charge were irrelevant to the consideration of the elements of Count 1. The Crown disputed the appellant's assertion that the offence was ""not one at which the legislation is principally aimed"". It questioned the logic of the appellant's submission that the objective criminality of the offence was reduced by reason of her Honour's incapacity to find that appellant intended to incite an act of terrorism.

147It was further submitted that her Honour was entitled to adopt Dr Kohlmann's description of the second half of the e-book. Absent a finding that her Honour's conclusion was not rationally open, this Court could not substitute its opinion for that of her Honour's. Any attempt to characterise the e-book as ""innocuous"" owing to an apparent lack of detail would be to disregard the jury's verdict. 

148According to the Crown, her Honour was entitled to find that the appellant published the e-book online in order to facilitate its dissemination. Dr Kohlmann's evidence laid a sufficient foundation for this finding. Judicial notice could be taken of the capacity of the Internet to facilitate the spread of information (Beard v Baulkham Hills Shire Council (1986) 7 NSWLR 273 at 278). In addition, there was evidence that the e-book had actually been distributed. Finally, the Crown pointed to material which it said disproved the appellant's assertions (i) that his actions were confined to causing the e-book to be published online, and (ii) that he took no steps to bring the e-book to the attention of others. 

DETERMINATION
149The appellant complains that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the jury's inability to reach a verdict in relation to Count 2. That is incorrect. Her Honour considered the matter, but determined, in my view correctly, that it was irrelevant to the sentencing task. The element of intention in Count 2 was no more relevant to the consideration of Count 1 than the fault element of any other Code offence. For the reasons provided by her Honour at [13], the possibility that the appellant intended to incite an act of terrorism was not excluded by the jury's failure to reach a verdict. For the reasons outlined by her Honour at [14], it cannot be said that the objective gravity of the Count 1 offence is reduced by reason of the absence of a verdict on Count 2. In addition, the absence of a finding of intention on Count 2 cannot possibly mitigate Count 1, the fault element of which is ""knowledge"". As the sentencing judge stated, ""the absence of an aggravating factor does not, as a matter of logic, mitigate an offence."" 

150It was open to her Honour to accept Dr Kohlmann's classification of the second half of the e-book. Having considered the contents of the e-book (see above at [5] - [12]) I have no hesitation in concluding that her Honour's finding was open on the evidence. I have reviewed the material in the documents included in the confidential volume. They do not suggest that her Honour's conclusion was other than correct.

151I reject ground 1.

Ground 2 Alleged error relating to the appellant's character

152At the sentence hearing, counsel for the appellant submitted that a finding of prior good character should be made, the appellant having no criminal record in Australia: s 16A(2)(m) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

153The Crown tendered evidence of the appellant's criminal history in Lebanon. The appellant had been convicted by the Permanent Military Court in Beirut for a number of offences in 2003 and again in 2005. The first set of convictions related to charges of forming a terrorist association, possessing explosive charges for the purpose of carrying out terrorist operations, and becoming concerned in a crime aimed at carrying out terrorist activities through explosive charges. The appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 10 years in relation to those offences. The second set of convictions related to the formation of a criminal group with the intention of committing crimes against people and property, and attempting to commit crimes that undermined the security of the Lebanese State. The proceedings were conducted in the appellant's absence. 

154The sentencing judge declined to make a finding of prior good character. Her Honour remarked that even if she was wrong in concluding that the appellant's foreign convictions were relevant, in offences concerning terrorism, ""good character is of minimal significance to the sentencing exercise"" (R v Lodhi (2006) 199 FLR 364 at [71], [91]). 

APPELLANT'S SUBMISSION
155According to the appellant, a court should not take into account an offender's foreign convictions where doing so would outrage the court's sense of justice (R v Postiglione (1991) 24 NSWLR 584 at 591 - 592). In the present case it was submitted that it would outrage this Court's sense of justice to take into account the appellant's foreign convictions because they were imposed in breach of the universal doctrine of procedural fairness. 

156The appellant tendered a transcript of proceedings before the Permanent Military Court which he said confirmed that he had been served in absentia. The appellant also tendered an English version of the relevant Lebanese statute which permitted service in absentia. The appellant submitted that the obligation to provide notice to an accused person of the time and place of his or her trial is a universal tenet of criminal justice. The appellant also drew attention to allegations made by some of the appellant's co-accused to the effect that they had been tortured by the authorities during the investigation phase. Those allegations, combined with the denial of procedural fairness, required the sentencing judge to disregard the foreign convictions. Absent any evidence capable of contradicting the appellant's evidence of prior good character, the appellant submitted that the sentencing judge was bound to make a finding of prior good character. Her Honour's alternative conclusion that character was ""of little moment"" in terrorism offences was erroneous. Her Honour had to give the appellant ""some credit"" for his good character: R v Stafrace (1997) 140 FLR 427 at 432 per Hunt CJ at CL.

CROWN SUBMISSIONS
157The Crown submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant was denied procedural fairness in Lebanon. The appellant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing disputing his guilt of those offences. Her Honour correctly applied the relevant principles taking into account the matters raised by the appellant and properly refused to sentence the appellant on the basis that he was a person of prior good character. The sentencing judge was also correct to conclude, in the alternative, that good character was of minimal relevance to the sentencing exercise given the nature of the offence. Even a finding of prior good character would not, in the Crown's view, have resulted in a lesser sentence.

DETERMINATION
158The relevant principles can be succinctly stated. A court may have regard to foreign convictions even where the system under which they were imposed does not conform with the common law criminal justice system: Postiglione at 593B. The question is whether the procedures leading to those convictions were such as to evoke the outrage of this Court. The evidence relied on by the appellant does not support an affirmative response to that question. As her Honour observed (at [40]): 

""[40] I note that the prisoner did not give evidence disputing his guilt of these offences, nor was there evidence that he had no notice of the charges. The evidence went no further than an extract from the relevant code which prescribed the method of service in the absence of a residential address. To the extent that the prisoner seeks to call into question the fairness of the trial process in Lebanon, the same complaint in R v Postiglione (1991) 24 NSWLR 585 was met with the following:

'The essence of complaint is that, in distinction from the common law trial method, the appellant was convicted without the opportunity of confronting and cross examining persons who incriminated him. Such an opportunity is fundamental to our system of trial but it does not follow that another system which involves proof of guilt by different procedures in investigation, evidence gathering and analysis must include the same step. The argument misapprehends that a course which is essential to the achievement of justice in one particular system must necessarily be an ingredient in another.'""

159Without more, this Court has no way of knowing whether the Permanent Military Court took steps to bring the charges to the appellant's attention. The material upon which the appellant relies demonstrates that many of the appellant's co-accused were arrested in person and were present at the trial in Beirut. The logical inference is that there were procedures in place for alerting accused persons to charges that had been brought against them and for inviting them to secure representation ahead of the trial. I agree with the sentencing judge that the appellant's submission goes no further than an unsubstantiated assertion that he was denied procedural fairness. 

160Even if the appellant could demonstrate that he did not receive notice of the charges, I am not persuaded that the Military Court's practice of serving notice in absentia is so outrageous as to render the appellant's convictions a ""nullity"", as the appellant contends. 

161This ground of appeal should be rejected.

Ground 3 Alleged failure to give proper consideration to the question of deterrence

162Her Honour considered the question of deterrence at [47]:

""[47] Terrorism offences have been described as crimes of notoriety and heinousness in the name of a political cause, requiring the imposition of a significant sentence in order to mark the seriousness with which the offence is viewed. General and specific deterrence, and denunciation, must be manifestly reflected in the sentence ultimately imposed, given that the objects of terrorism are to use violence, or the threat thereof, as an instrument of coercion and/or intimidation of governments, in the pursuit of a political, religious or ideological cause. The offence committed by the prisoner falls within this rubric. The potential for great harm to members of the public, the economy and the social fabric, reinforces the obligation of the courts to denounce terrorism in all its forms by the imposition of sentences that have a strong deterrent effect : R v Demirian (1988) 33 A Crim R 441; R v Lodhi (2006) 199 FLR 364; R v Barot [2007] EWCA Crim 1119; R v Benbrika [2009] VSC 21.""

163The appellant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in failing to analyse the extent to which the appellant's sentence would deter the appellant and others from committing similar offences. It was said that her Honour incorrectly assumed that the greater the sentence, the greater its deterrent effect. The appellant's submission reads:

""Indeed, a sentence may become counter-productive, not simply undermining the principle of deterrence, but instead provoking the commission of further offences.""

164The appellant cited the case of Rahman v R [2008] EWCA Crim 1465 in which Lord Phillips CJ observed at [8]: 

""As Calvert-Smith J remarked when imposing sentence in R v. Adel Yahya at the Central Criminal Court on 5 November 2007:

'The offence to which you have pleaded guilty - under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 - is one which may be committed in an almost infinite variety of ways. The sentence appropriate for a particular offence of this kind will need to reflect the particular facts and circumstances of the offender.'

If sentences are imposed which are more severe than the circumstances of the particular case warrant this will be likely to inflame rather than deter extremism. ...""

165The Crown was of the view that her Honour gave appropriate weight to the question of deterrence. Considerations of denunciation and deterrence are of particular significance in terrorism offences: R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 691 (per Whealy J at [89], [92]); Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470 (per Spigelman CJ at [88], per Barr J at [210] - [214] and per Price J at [273] - [274]); see also R v Barot [2007] EWCA Crim 1119 at [45]. The Crown distinguished Rahman on the basis that the remarks of Calvert-Smith J (cited with approval by Lord Phillips CJ) were made in the context of an offender who, unlike the appellant, was found to have been merely reckless. 

166I reject the appellant's submission. The sentencing judge appropriately recognised that offences relating to terrorism have a particular capacity to raze the social, cultural and economical foundations of our community. As her Honour observed, the means by which terrorists achieve their aims include violence or threats of violence, coercion and intimidation. There is a need to impose sentences adequate in length to deter offenders and would-be offenders. I am unable to accept the appellant's contention that the sentencing judge overlooked the practical impact of the sentence. The appellant's reliance on Rahman reveals the circularity inherent in his submission. Lord Phillips CJ was addressing the problems associated with the imposition of excessive sentences for terrorism offences. It is not possible to reason, on the basis of his Honour's remarks, that the sentencing judge gave excessive weight to considerations of general and specific deterrence. 

167I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 4 Alleged failure to give proper weight to appellant's bail conditions

168The appellant's bail conditions included the usual requirements of good behaviour, residence at a notified address and daily reporting. Additional conditions required the appellant to undertake not to publish any material, not to make any public appearances, not to use the Internet, not to make any international telephone calls, not to initiate any contact with persons overseas, to permit the authorities to monitor his mobile telephone calls and to remain within the geographical limits of Metropolitan Sydney. The appellant was subject to a total of 37 bail conditions over a period of more than 4 years. 

169The sentencing judge rejected the appellant's claim for leniency, remarking (at [50]): 

""[50] Throughout this period of time, the prisoner was subject to bail conditions which were deemed necessary by the court, having regard to the nature of the charges the prisoner was facing. Whilst those bail conditions restricted the prisoner's movements to the extent that he was required to reside at a notified address, report daily to Campsie police station and travel only in the metropolitan area of Sydney, they do not qualify as quasi-custodial.""

170The appellant asserted that the sentencing judge erred in limiting her consideration of the appellant's bail conditions to those that restricted his freedom of movement. It was submitted that her Honour did not take into account the limits placed upon the appellant's freedom of expression and association. 

171In the Crown's view, the sentencing judge considered all relevant conditions, including those restricting the appellant's freedom of movement, and determined that they were not ""quasi-custodial"". In any event, significantly less weight should be given to bail conditions, factors such as deterrence and denunciation being more salient (R v Fowler (2003) 151 A Crim R 166).

172In my view, although the appellant's bail conditions were onerous, they were appropriate given the nature of the offence. Her Honour determined that notwithstanding that the nature, extent and duration of the conditions resulted in significant limits being placed upon the appellant's liberties for a very lengthy period of time, they were not ""quasi custodial"". To my mind, that finding was open. Her Honour was not obliged to reduce the appellant's sentence on account of those conditions. 

173I reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 5 Manifest excess

174The appellant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive as a result of the matters complained of in grounds 1 - 4 of the sentence appeal. I reject the submission. To my mind her Honour had appropriate regard to the criminality involved and gave adequate consideration to the circumstances of the appellant. The sentence imposed was within the appropriate range of sentence for this offence.

ORDERS

175It would follow from my reasons for judgment that I would dismiss the appeal. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss that appeal. However, mine is a minority view. 

176Hall J would uphold grounds of appeal which may have led to an acquittal. However, McCallum J agrees with me but for ground 4 in respect of which she agrees with Hall J. The consequence must be that the appeal is allowed in relation to ground 4, the conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered.

177HALL J: The appellant, Belal Khazaal, was charged with two offences. The first offence was a count of making a document connected with the preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act, knowing of such a connection contrary to the provisions of s.101.5(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).

178The appellant was also charged with one count of attempting to urge another to engage in a terrorist act, contrary to s.11.1(1), s.11.4(1) and s.101.1(1) of the Criminal Code.

179The appellant was tried before a judge and jury in the Supreme Court. The jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of the first count, but were unable to reach a verdict in relation to the second count.

180The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years.

181The Crown has yet to decide whether it wishes to proceed to a re-trial in respect of Count 2.

182By notice of appeal dated 28 June 2010, the appellant relied upon the following grounds of appeal:-

""1) A miscarriage of justice occurred, as a result of her Honour failing to discharge the jury in circumstances in which counsel for the Appellant had inadvertently tendered magazines, and which made clear reference to material suggesting there was a link between al-Qaeda and the Appellant;

and, further, her Honour erred in:

2) directing the jury to disregard the submission made by counsel for the Appellant during his closing address, in which he suggested that the jury should, when considering whether the book was connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act, take into account the delay by the authorities in seeking the removal of that book from availability at large;

3) directing the jury in relation to count 1 that the words 'connected with' were simply to be given their ordinary meaning; and

4) holding that the Appellant had failed to discharge the evidential burden provided for by s.101.5(5) Criminal Code (C'th), and in consequence declining to direct the jury that the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the document was intended to facilitate preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act.""

183By the notice of appeal, the appellant also sought leave to appeal in respect of the sentence imposed on him on 25 September 2009.

The indictment
Count 1
184The appellant was charged by way of indictment dated 3 July 2008 in which he was charged that between 20 September 2003 and 23 September 2003 at Sydney and elsewhere in the world he did make a document connected with assistance in a terrorist act knowing of that connection contrary to the provisions of s.101.5(1) of the Criminal Code.

Count 2

185He was charged on the same indictment with an offence that between 22 September 2003 and about 8 October 2003 at Sydney and elsewhere in the world he did attempt to urge the commission by others of an offence, namely, engaging in a terrorist act contrary to s.101.1(1) of the Criminal Code.

186For the purposes of the present appeal, the full terms of the indictment in relation to the offence alleged under s.101.5(1) are set out below. In that respect, the indictment alleged:-

""1.1 The document made was a book titled 'Provisions on the Rules of Jihad - Short Judicial rulings and organisational instructions for fighters and Mujahideen against infidels'.

1.2 The terrorist act was an action or threat of action against any one or more of a number of persons identified in the document including diplomats, military personnel and holders of public office done or threatened""

(a) with the intention of advancing a political religious or ideological cause, namely the advancement of the Muslim religion in the world including the dominance of that religion in Arabia as defined in the document and/or the establishment of a Muslim nation in that region and/or the expulsion of Jews, Christians and other non-Muslims from that region; and

(b) with the intention of:

i. coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or of a foreign country; or

ii. intimidating the public or a section of the public; and

(c) in circumstances where the action, if carried out, would:-

i. cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or

ii. cause serious damage to property; or

iii. cause a person's death; or

iv. endanger a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or

v. create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public; and

(d) the action or threat of action was not to be done as advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action.

Alternatively, if the action or threat of action was to be done as advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action, it would be of a kind intended to:

i. cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or

ii. cause a person's death; or

iii. endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or

iv. create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.""

Outline of facts
187The appellant made a document, in the sense that he compiled a book in Arabic entitled ""Provisions on the Rules of Jihad"". This was the result of a number of downloads by him of various articles from internet sites over the relevant period of the charge (20 to 23 September 2003). The appellant selected the contents of the book and placed the chapters in a designated order. He undertook a number of editorial changes and contributed some commentary of his own to the book, including a dedication and part of an introduction. The appellant also added a small number of footnotes and renumbered others.

188In the second part of the book, there were parts which promoted and referred to methods of assassination and the commission of acts of violence in the name of restoring the nation of Islam.

189The appellant, using a pseudonym, submitted the document for publication on an internet site, ""Al Maqdessy"", which, according to expert evidence at the trial, was endorsed by al-Qaeda and contained a number of publications of leaders of known terrorist organisations. At the time of submitting the document, the appellant expressed the hope that it would be published on the website or anywhere else that the administrators of that site saw fit.

190Evidence, including Optus records, traced the relevant internet service to the appellant's residence in Lakemba. At that address, investigators located a personal computer used by the appellant in connection with internet communications relevant to the compilation of the book which he, in due course, caused to be posted on the Al Maqdessy website.

191Two or three sections of the book were accessed by the appellant on the Al Maqdessy website and were downloaded. An editing process was applied to the downloaded documents before their final presentation appearing in the book.

192On 22 September 2003, the appellant sent the book to the Al Maqdessy website with a request for the book to be published on that website.

193A little later, on 23 September 2003, the accused reformatted the book from A5 size sheets down to A4 size sheets and again sent it to the Al Maqdessy website via the internet.

194The appellant was alleged to have sent an Arabic message with the A4 version of the book. The message was translated as follows:-

""Dear Brother, Should you wish to publish my message, which I have recently sent, namely, 'Provisions on the Rules of Jihad', I hope you would use the attachment sent with message. It is copied on A4 and thus becomes suitable for publication, making 102 pages rather than the previous arrangement, which was on 188 pages. God's blessing.""

The Crown case
195In the Crown case on Count 1, it was alleged that, in terms of making the document, referred to in this judgment as ""the book"", the appellant was not the author in the sense of being the original composer of the downloaded material and carried out work as detailed above. The Crown case was that the book had a certain quality to it in that it was connected with assistance in a terrorist act (transcript 13 August 2008 at AB 21).

196In assembling the material for the purpose of compiling the book, the evidence was that the appellant himself selected content from material that was downloaded from the internet, as well as the dedication and part of the introduction. 

197The prosecution relied upon the contents of the book in order to establish what it contended was a connection within the meaning of s.101.5(1)(b) with a terrorist act.

198The Crown further alleged that the appellant knew of that connection.

199The full title of the book was ""Provisions on the Rules of Jihad - Short Judicial Rulings and Organisational Instructions for Fighters and Mujahideen against Infidels"". It became Exhibit G in the proceedings.

200The Crown called a translator, Dr Muhammad Gamal. Dr Gamal's native language is Arabic. His evidence was directed at the translation of the book prepared by the appellant and other Arabic language documents in evidence in the trial.

201The Crown alleged that the terrorist act was an action or threat of action. The Crown did not allege that in consequence any incident ultimately happened. It was pointed out by the Crown in its opening to the jury that it was not necessary for an actual action to be carried out provided it otherwise met the statutory definition of the expression ""terrorist act"". Accordingly, a threat of an action of a certain kind, it was observed, would be sufficient to amount to a terrorist act.

202The Crown case alleged that the terrorist act was an action or threat against any one or more of a number of persons identified in paragraph 1.2 of the indictment (""including diplomats, military personnel and holders of public office ..."").

203The action alleged to be done or threatened was purported to have been done with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, namely, the advancement of the Muslim religion in the world.

204The Crown alleged that the action or threat of action amounted to assistance in a terrorist act. If done, it was not going to be mere advocacy nor protest or dissent.

205The Crown observed in its opening address that the document prepared by the appellant represented itself as having been compiled and prepared by Abu Mohamed Attawheedy. The Crown case was that that name referred to the accused. It alleged that he deliberately did not use his true name and that it was a deliberate attempt to distance himself from being connected with the document.

206The first entry in the dedication to the book, (p.9), was entitled ""Militant Jihad is the Best Form of Jihad"". Whilst the Crown acknowledged that the term ""Jihad"" may not, in certain contexts, have a sinister meaning, in this case it was alleged that it was expressly dealing with militant Jihad, not a peaceful, passive or persuasive type of Jihad, but one that was of a forceful, violent and coercive type (AB 29).

207It will be necessary to refer to specific parts of the book upon which reliance was placed upon the Crown in order to establish the offence under Count 1.

208The Crown case was that the first half of the book contained religious or ideological justifications for Jihad, meaning ""violent struggle"". The second half of the book, it was said, provided a practical guide to achieving martyrdom and destroying those who would oppose or oppress Islam.

209The book bore the date 18 September 2003. It was put on the Al Maqdessy website a few days later.

210It was the Crown's case that the words written on the introductory page to the book were written by the appellant. They were in the following terms:-

""This is but a short message I hastily prepared in response to a request from brothers working to support this religion. I was requested to prepare it, in this fashion, to serve as a reference to all brothers or small cells desiring to support this religion.""

211These introductory comments continued:-

""With God's help I set on its compilation and I completed it in a few days. I am, however, convinced that had I sufficient time and had I been settled in my residence I would have produced a better job than this work which has been conceived in haste. However, better 'haste' than never.""

212In the next paragraph, the statement continued:-

""I seek the Almighty's reward and I seek martyrdom for his sake. I do so running towards it, not away from it. I beseech my brothers to pray that I may attain martyrdom.""

213The Crown case was that the evidence relating to the downloading of materials and the compilation of them provided evidence that the appellant had directly turned his mind to important sections of the book by editing them before they appeared in a final format. The Crown contended this would indicate preparation beyond mere selection of documents at random without giving any thought when compiling them and before sending them to a website. The Crown argued that the evidence indicated there had been a thoughtful and considered process of editing of the chapters in the book in the form the appellant wanted them to be expressed (Crown opening at AB 45-46).

214Although there was evidence that the work was compiled in haste, it was the Crown contention that, whatever haste was involved it was not such that the appellant failed to appreciate the true message of the book.

215In the opening, the Crown Prosecutor stated (AB 46):-

""The Crown case is that the accused knew that in making that book he was assisting terrorism, and by the accused causing that book to be posted on the Al Maqdessy website, he was attempting to urge others to engage in a terrorist act.""

216In the course of the Crown case, emphasis was given to particular parts of the material constituting the book. In particular, there was material that made reference to the targeting of foreign governments, including the Presidents, Foreign Ministers, Ministers of Defence and ""high ranking generals"" of the Governments of America, Britain, France, Germany, Australia, Canada, Russia, India and other NATO countries.

217The Crown, as earlier indicated, in particular, relied upon passages in the book entitled ""Reasons for Assassination"". The Crown contended that these promoted methods of assassination and the commission of acts of violence in the name of restoring the nation of Islam.

218Some of the sub-headings in that chapter reflected or were indicative of the tenor of the material in question. These included the sub-headings ""Characteristics of the Assassination Team"" (AB 655-657), ""Optimal Conditions for Assassination"" (AB 657), ""Features and Stages of the Assassination Process"" (AB 657-661), ""Aspects of the Assassination Mission"" (AB 661-663), ""Methods and Means of Assassination"" (AB 663-674), ""Targets that should be Assassinated"" (AB 675-676) and ""Benefits of Assassination"" (AB 676-677).

219The chapter in the book, Reasons for Assassination, according to the introduction was, subject to ""minor changes"", said to have been the work of a known author. The introduction was in the following terms:-

""This chapter was copied with minor changes from a message by our esteemed brother, Sheikh Abu Jandal Alazzdy, may God protect him, in which he motivates Mujahideen to revive the ritual of assassination.

Today, there are many reasons and motives for assassination as far as Mujahideen are concerned. For others there are scores of reasons.""

220In the part of the chapter entitled ""Targets that should be Assassinated"", the ""identities"" to which the chapter refers are indicated as ""atheists"" and by reference to ""nationalities"". In that respect, it was recorded:-

""Identities that should be assassinated are in this order, as far as I think:

1. All Jewish, Christian and Arab atheists among the diplomats, ambassadors and the military in Arabia. The definition of Arabia for Majahideen is the area that covers Yemen, Oman, Saudi, Kuwait, Qatar, The Emirates and Bahrain. This extension is due to the legal texts that call for the expulsion of Jews, Christians and Infidels from Arabia. The enemy nationalities are ranked in accordance to their importance:

1. American

2. British

3. French

4. Rest of NATO members

5. Rest of Christians

6. Hindus and Buddhists

7. Russians

These nationalities, with the aid and participation of Jews, fight, kill, rape and pillage Muslims. This is well-known world wide and is for everyone to see. This is how they infiltrate:

...""

221The document also sets out other categories of ""identities"" including those referred to as ""Imams of Apostasy"". In part, the description is as follows (Exhibit G at p.675 - 676):-

""2. Imams of Apostasy: Who exist in Arabia such as State Presidents, Ministers of the Interior, Foreign Ministers, Ministers of Defense who are promoting and defending atheism. The rest of the Imams of Apostasy in the Arab Countries which are falsely called Islamic states such as ... in addition to anyone who blasphemes God or the prophet such as journalists and the media whose insult has been proven publicly ...

3. Holders of key positions in the original countries of atheism fighting such as the president, then the Minister of Defense, Foreign Minister, Chief of Intelligence, National Security and the high ranking generals. The countries are listed in the following order:

First: America

Second: Britain and between the two Israel which is the misnomer for the Jews

Third: France

Fourth: Germany

Fifth: Australia

Sixth: Canada

Seventh: Rest of NATO countries

Eighth: Russia

Ninth: India

...""

222The chapter ""Reasons for Assassination"" and the chapter entitled ""The Last Word"" were introduced by the appellant's composition expressed in what was said to have been favourable terms in the first paragraph of each of those chapters.

223There was expert evidence called in the Crown case that the internet site used for the book was one that was endorsed by Al-Qaeda and that it contained a number of publications by leaders of known terrorist organisations. It was noted by the trial judge in the course of her remarks on sentence that the appellant, when submitting the document for publication, expressed the hope that it would be published on this website, or anywhere else that the administrators of the website saw fit.

224The appellant referred to the document as an ""Urging for jihad"" which he said was prepared in haste following a request from ""the brothers"".

225The Crown case was opened on 13 August 2008. The explanation by the Crown of the indictment included reference to the fact that the terrorist act was ""... an action or threat of action against one or more of a number of persons identified in the document ... including diplomats, military personnel and holders of public office ... it goes beyond that category, but they are, on the Crown case, certainly in there (transcript 13 August 2008, AB 22).

226The Crown added (AB 22-23):-

""We are setting out to prove that matter (an action or threat of action done or threatened with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause and that his identified as the advancement of the Muslim religion in the world) ... beyond reasonable doubt, together with, that is plus, (b), and with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the Government of the Commonwealth, that is the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a foreign country ...""

The provisions of the Criminal Code

227Section 101.5(1) of the Criminal Code is in the following terms:-

""101.5 Collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts


(1) A person commits an offence if: 

(a) the person collects or makes a document; and

(b) the document is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act; and

(c) the person mentioned in paragraph (a) knows of the connection described in paragraph (b).""


228Section 101.5(5), essentially provides the basis for a specific defence with a defendant having the evidential burden in relation to the matter in s.101.5(5). That provision is in the following terms:-

""(5) Sub-sections (1) and (2) do not apply if the collection or making of the document was not intended to facilitate preparation for, engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act.

Note: a defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in sub-section (5) (see sub-section (13.3(3)).""

The elements of Counts 1 and 2

229The elements of each of the offences may be identified as follows:-

Count 1

(1) Elements of the offence under s.101.5(1)

(a) The accused is guilty of the offence if:-

(i) the accused made the document: a physical element - conduct (s.4.1 Criminal Code)

(ii) that he did so intentionally: fault element: intention and knowledge (s.11.1(3)(1) Criminal Code)

(iii) the document was connected with assistance in a terrorist act: as defined in s.100.1 Criminal Code (the second physical element) and

(iv) the accused knew of that connection: a fault element (knowledge) (s.101.5(1)(c) Criminal Code).

Count 2

230The accused is guilty of the offence of attempt if:-

""(i) The accused attempted to urge the commission of an offence, namely, the offence of engaging in a terrorist act (""terrorist act"" is used as defined in s.100.1 Criminal Code) and

(ii) the accused's conduct in attempting to urge the commission of the offence was more than merely preparatory: s.11.1(2) Criminal Code; and

(iii) the accused intended that the offence be committed: fault element (intention) (s.11.4(2) Criminal Code).""

Crown submissions on the elements of the offence in Count 1
231In the document ""Crown Submissions concerning Jury Directions"", the Crown set out its submissions in relation to Counts 1 and 2. In relation to Count 1, the written submission was in the following terms:-

""Count 1: 

The accused made a document

3. The Crown case is that the accused's acts in selecting the content of and compiling the Arabic script document represented by Exhibits D, E and EE, including adding his own words and making editorial changes to parts of the compilation, constitutes the making of a document.

He did so intentionally

4. On the evidence, the above acts must have been intentional; they could not have been unintentional.

The document was connected with assistance in a terrorist act

5. The meaning of 'terrorist act' is addressed hereafter. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that 'terrorist acts' means an action or threat of action having certain characteristics.

6. In the trial of Faheem Lodhi, Whealy J directed the jury that:-

The phrase 'connected with preparation for an action or threat of action' is an ordinary English expression and requires no special analysis.

It is submitted that the phrase 'connected with assistance in an action or threat of action' is in the same category.

7. It is the document itself that must be connected with such preparation. Based on the examples given by Whealy J in Lodhi (at p 39 of the summing up), and having regard to the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'connected with assistance in an action or threat of action', the connection need be no more than a link between the making of the document and the preparation for an action or threat of action. This is a question of fact.

8. In relation to 'assistance', all that must be established is that the making of the document is connected with assisting an action or threat of action. 'Assistance' has its ordinary meaning, namely, 'to help', or to make it easier for someone to do something.

The accused knew of that connection

9. The Crown must prove that the accused knew that the document was connected with assistance in an action or threat of action.""

232In written submissions on behalf of the appellant dated 28 August 2008, it was submitted, inter alia, as follows:-

""2. As already raised in oral argument, the accused specifically seeks the following two directions:

· You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the book was connected with assistance in a terrorist act. The words 'connected with' mean that the book must itself have been capable of directly assisting in the commission of a terrorist act. A mere remote connection will not suffice. The word 'assistance' is, of course, a word that is used in everyday language and is to be understood in that sense, that is, aiding, making easier or facilitating.

· If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the book was connected with assistance in a terrorist act and that the accused knew of that connection, you must consider whether it was at least a reasonable possibility that the collection or making of the book was not intended to facilitate assistance in a terrorist act ...""

Written trial directions concerning Count 1

233In respect of Count 1, the directions were in the following terms:-

""The elements of the offences, which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt, are as follows:-

Count 1

(a) Between 20 September 2003 and 23 September 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, the accused made a document;

and

(b) He intended to make the document;

and

(c) The document was connected with assistance in an action or threat of action against any one or more of a number of persons, including diplomats, military personnel and holders of public office;

and

(d) The action or threat of action referred to in (c) was a terrorist act (see NOTE 1);

and

(e) The accused knew (that is, he was aware) at the time he made the document, of the connection between the document and assistance in the action, or threat of action, referred to in (c), that is:

(i) he was aware of the action, or threat of action referred to in (c); and

(ii) he was aware of the intention by that action, or threat of action, to advance a political, religious or ideological cause, namely, the advancement of the Muslim religion in the world, including the dominance of that religion in Arabia as defined in the document and/or the establishment of a Muslim nation in that region and/or the expulsion of Jews, Christians and other non-Muslims from that region; and

(iii) he was aware, by that action or threat of action, it was intended to coerce or influence by intimidation one or more of the following - the Government of the Commonwealth, the Government of a foreign country or to intimidate the public or a section of the public; and

(iv) he was aware that the action or threat of action, if carried out, would cause serious physical harm to a person; or serious damage to property; or a person's death; or endanger a person's life, and other than the life of the person taking the action; or create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public; and

(v) he was aware that the action or threat of action was not advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action OR he was aware that the action or threat of action was intended to cause serious physical harm to a person; or a person's death; or was intended to endanger a person's life, other than the life of the person taking the action; or was intended to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.

If the above elements are proved beyond reasonable doubt, the offence charged in Count 1 of the Indictment is committed, even if a terrorist act does not occur.""


The defence case

234It was contended on behalf of the appellant, that the book was a journalistic work and that it consisted of a compilation of various works by various authors throughout a number of different periods in history. The first portion of the book was said to be largely uncontroversial and dealt with historic justifications for jihad in Islam. The second was described in submissions for the appellant as being ""more belligerent"" and provided a collection of modern writings. The defence argued that the book was not a work that could be considered a terrorist manual, since it did not provide concrete instructions on how to commit terrorist acts. Instead, it was said to be merely a collection of points of view. This argument was supported by the fact that the appellant, at the relevant time, had been an accredited journalist and one who had a considerable interest in religious matters.

235The contention on behalf of the appellant was that there was no evidence that, at the time of making the book, it was connected with assistance in a terrorist act. Specific attention in this respect focused upon the meaning to be attributed to the phrase ""in connection with"". It was contended that there was no evidence of the required connection. The defence was that the connection element for an offence under s.101.5(1) of the Criminal Code had not been established.

The Grounds of appeal 
236The appellant relied upon four grounds of appeal. I respectfully agree with the reasons for judgment given by the presiding judge, McClellan CJ at CL, in respect of Ground 2. I, however, have reached different conclusions in respect of the remaining grounds. 

Ground 1: Whether there was a miscarriage of justice by reason of the trial judge's refusal to discharge the jury

(1) The facts

237There were two articles that had been published in the periodical magazine ""The Call of Islam"" (at trial referred to as the ""Al-Nida ul Islam"" magazine). Both formed part of defence Exhibit 5. The first is styled as a ""Media Release"" and formed part of Issue 2, Volume 10, July/September 2003 (p.5). The article was entitled ""Four Corners Missed the Target"". It was a publication in response to material, including allegations, that had been made on the programme entitled ""The Australian Connections"" on the ABC's Four Corners programme presented on 10 June 2003. The article was in the nature of a rebuttal, expressed in fairly strong terms, of the allegations that had been made against the appellant.

238In the formulation of the rebuttal, explicit references were made to the content of ""the Australian Connections"" programme which was broadcast on national television. Accordingly, a reader of the article would become aware of the material said to have been relied upon by the ABC journalist and, in particular, and the source of the material identified in the Four Corners programme. 

239It is sufficient, for the purposes of Ground 1, to refer only to parts of the published article. It commenced as follows:-

""Based on a so-called 'secret CIA intelligence report' containing allegations on terrorism, Four Corners' Sally Neighbour identified Bilal Khazaal, one of the members of the Islamic Youth Movement (IYM), as a leader of Al-Qaeda in Australia, claiming that he had been trained in Afghanistan; he was a financier of the 'Isbat Al-Ansar' in South Lebanon; and that he was planning for terrorist attacks in the Philippines and Venezuela.

Although Four Corners in the past has produced some excellent reports with in-depth analyses, last night's report was a giveaway to Australia's racist and special interest groups.

Four Corners must have been desperate to rely on a 'secret CIA intelligence report' simply because, although the ABC are aware of the fascicle nature of so-called reports from 'intelligence' agencies, it chose to run with it, hailing it as 'new intelligence'.""

240The article stated that if the CIA had had the ""intelligence"" since June 2002, it had not made Australian security agencies aware of it. The article also belittled the CIA in various respects which need not, here, be reproduced. The article maintained that:-

""In the absence of hard facts, Four Corners based its story on a CIA fabricated report; and it also rehashed old allegations of training camps, linkage to terrorist organisations and threats to Australia's security, all of which were refuted several years ago"".

241In the second article entitled ""No evidence, just fabrication against Bilal Khazal [sic]"" published in Issue 3, Volume 10, June/August 2004 in the periodical, The Call of Islam, similar statements are to be found. The article opened by saying that the appellant and his brother were facing a barrage of ""... lies and false accusations, mounted in a propaganda campaign by the Western intelligence and media agencies, to link them to al-Qaeda and 'terrorism'.""

242The article referred to the ABC Four Corners programme and noted that it was ""... based on a so-called CIA report, that Bilal Khazal [sic] was identified as an al-Qaeda member who had been trained in Afghanistan ..."". The article re-stated similar material as appeared in the first article.

243A reference was made to the fact that media networks had seized on what was referred to as ""... the fabricated CIA report ..."". The article also made reference to published articles and, in particular, media articles that had named the appellant as having ""... strong links to numerous Islamic extremist groups including al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah"". The article again contained rebuttals of the allegations and, in doing so, stated:-

""... The only link between Bilal Khazal [sic] and Mohammed Kaaka is the Nidual Islam magazine.""

244The forensic purpose of the cross-examination of Mr Kohlmann was said to have been aimed at establishing that the magazine was a legitimate publication and one that was freely available and for the production of which the appellant was largely responsible. The forensic purpose was to establish the appellant's past journalist endeavours so as to demonstrate that the book, the subject of the charges, had been compiled for literary, rather than for nefarious purposes. One of the magazines on which Mr Kohlmann was cross-examined became an exhibit in the defence case (Exhibit 2).

245On the following day of the trial, the disputed articles were tendered on 25 August 2008 at t.569, line 45. It is recorded:-

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Could I mention one matter that slipped my mind. Mr Thomas showed Mr Kohlmann a number of Al-Nida ul Islam magazines which were marked MFI 14, in cross-examination. They are not before the jury. I invite my friend to tender them. If he declines, then I would call on him in front of the jury to tender them.""

246The members of the jury were then recalled into Court. The transcript records at p.570:-

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: There were some Al-Nida ul Islam magazines shown to Mr Kohlmann which were marked for identification 14 in addition to the magazine that became Exhibit 2. I understand my learned friend is going to tender them. He may have some additional ones as well.

(APPELLANT'S THEN COUNSEL): I tender MFI 14. With the consent of my learned friend, I tender all of the other magazines that are in my possession.

HER HONOUR: Do we need all of them?

(APPELLANT'S THEN COUNSEL): I think so, given the nature of the issues in the case. Only parts of the magazine are in the English language. These are, as I understand it, all of the editions published back to 1994.

HER HONOUR: There are four in MFI 14?

(APPELLANT'S THEN COUNSEL): Yes, there are.

HER HONOUR: How many are there in the other bundle?

(APPELLANT'S THEN COUNSEL): 32.

EXHIBIT #4: FOUR AL-NIDA UL ISLAM MAGAZINES, PREVIOUSLY MFI 14, TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION

EXHIBIT #5: ADDITIONAL 32 AL-NIDA UL ISLAM MAGAZINES TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION""

247Counsel for the prosecution at some point soon after took the opportunity to uplift Exhibits 4 and 5 to peruse the magazines overnight (t.597, lines 5 to 7).

(2) The application for a discharge

248Some days later, counsel then appearing for the appellant stated (t.810, lines 36 to 48):-

""We accept that these magazines were tendered as a bundle. Your Honour will recall that we tendered all of the magazines that were in our possession in relation to the Call of Islam magazine. I must say, for my part, I had relied upon what I had been instructed in relation to content.

Clearly, this material is devastating as far as the accused is concerned. The object here is to have a fair trial. We accept that the material has been put in by the defence. However, it has been put in in circumstances where, as a result of an oversight, this material was not picked up.

Our object in putting all of the material relating to these magazines was obvious. That is, the magazine is relevant to the proceedings. My friend suggest that there is a connection between the accused and the magazine, which we accept. It is, indeed, part of our case.""

249The application for a discharge of the jury was refused.

250In her Honour's judgment delivered on 2 September 2008 on the application, the trial judge noted the submission made by the appellant's then counsel to the effect that the contents of the articles and the Crown's reference to them gave rise to ""an incurable prejudice"". It was said that this was despite the fact that the articles themselves contained a refutation, in strongest terms, as to the accused's alleged links to al-Qaeda and to alleged funding by him of terrorist acts.

251The trial judge referred to the fact that it was pertinent to observe that, at the beginning of the trial, the jury panel and the jury were told to disregard any publicity about the accused that they may have been exposed to and, additionally, they were told that they must confine themselves to the evidence in the trial.

252The trial judge also observed that those instructions, and similar instructions in strong terms, would be included in the summing up. The question, the trial judge stated, was ""... whether such directions will be ignored or overlooked by the jury to the prejudice of the accused"" (p.2).

253Her Honour then proceeded to refer to observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; (2008) 72 NSWLR 258 and to those made by the Chief Justice in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344.

254Reference was made to observations of Gleeson CJ in Regina v VPH (CCA, unreported 4 March 1994) and to McHugh J in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425 concerning compliance by juries with directions given by a trial judge.

255The trial judge also referred to the fact that the perspective that jurors properly perform their tasks, are true to their oaths and comply with the trial judge's directions has been repeatedly applied in appellate courts over recent years. The trial judge concluded (AB 591):-

""I am not persuaded that the jury will fail to abide by the directions I have given and propose to give. In any event, the articles themselves rebut the allegations made in the programme. It may be the case that some members of the jury did see the programme when it aired in June 2003 and that the articles have only served to remind them of the allegations made therein. If that is so, then the Crown's reference to the articles does not add significantly to what those members of the jury already knew.

Furthermore, it is not irrelevant that the magazines were tendered by the accused. Nothing in the magazines was thought to be so prejudicial that they could not be placed for the jury. For these reasons, the application is refused.""

256In relation to this last-mentioned statement, I observe that the trial judge did not refer to the fact that the potentially damaging parts of the articles had been tendered inadvertently, that is, through oversight. I will return to this aspect later in this judgment.

257In the course of the summing up, the trial judge referred to the fact that there had been references made in the course of the addresses to the Call of Islam magazine and to a Four Corners programme in 2004. The trial judge added that ""of course, the subject of that programme, which was the accused's alleged links to al-Qaeda and his alleged funding of terrorist acts, was strongly refuted by the accused through the magazine itself"". 

258In the summing up, the trial judge directed the jury in the following terms (AB 379-380):-

""That is a particularly important consideration in the context of this trial. Notorious acts of terrorism have been referred to in the course of the evidence and it would be surprising if those events, particularly when they have resulted in the deaths of many innocent people, do not conjure up strong emotions and feelings of revulsion. We would all be less than human if that was not the case. There have also been references made in the course of the addresses to the Al-Nida magazine and to a Four Corners programme in 2004. Of course, the subject of that programme, which was the accused's alleged links to al-Qaeda and his alleged funding of terrorist acts, was strongly refuted by the accused through the magazine itself. The fact that such allegations have been made against the accused does not prove anything. We are all exposed to media coverage on a daily basis of many controversial events. It will not surprise you to hear that media outlets are fallible. They have been shown to be wrong in the past and they will be shown to be wrong in the future. As I have said a number of times in this trial, you must put these matters completely to one side and objectively consider the evidence brought against the accused on the specific charges in the indictment. He is not charged with being a terrorist. He is not charged with committing a terrorist act. There is no evidence that the accused is a member of al-Qaeda. There is no evidence that the accused communicated directly with any prominent member of al-Qaeda or any of the authors of the chapters of the book.

It would be quite wrong of you to conclude that he is guilty of these offences merely because the book refers to act[s] of terrorism or to terrorist organisations or because there has been media reports about the accused's alleged links to al-Qaeda. It is much more complex than that.""

Appellant's submissions

259In the detailed written submissions on behalf of the appellant, it was contended that the trial judge's reasons indicate error. Firstly, this was maintained insofar as the refusal of the application was, in part, based upon the proposition that the appellant had staunchly denied the allegations made in the Four Corners programme, thereby minimising any potential prejudice. Secondly, given that the allegations were highly prejudicial, directions could not counteract the prejudicial effect with the result that a fair trial was improbable.

260It was further argued that the prejudicial matters referred to in the articles went to matters directly in contest in the trial. In particular, it was observed that there was no admissible evidence of any direct link between the appellant and the organisation known as al-Qaeda. However, tender of the articles resulted in information going to the jury alleging that there was in fact a direct link or association between the appellant and al-Qaeda.

261A matter of particular importance was said to be that the damaging allegations referred to in the articles had been made in the programme on an alleged CIA report, a well-known intelligence agency.

Crown's submissions

262In the Crown submissions, reference was made to the fact that there was an issue in the trial which it was entitled to prove, namely, that the appellant was an enthusiastic al-Qaeda supporter. Additionally, it was observed, the claimed prejudicial material in the two articles had been flatly denied by the appellant in those articles.

263The Crown also argued that the material in the articles was not of the nature of a criminal record or bad character or antecedents and did not have the quality of inadmissible evidence of a prior conviction. A high degree of necessity to discharge the jury did not arise in this case.

264The Crown relied upon the trial judge's stated reasons to the effect that the articles rebutted (in strong terms) the allegations made in the programme. In particular, it was submitted (at [10]):-

""... The articles contain detailed arguments in support of their themes that the programme and newspaper stories were untrue, unfair, unbalanced and calculated to inflame community passions against Australian Muslims, using the Appellant and his brother as the vehicle for the attack ...""

Applications for discharge of jury - relevant principles
265There is no rigid rule to be applied in deciding an application to discharge a jury when an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event occurs during a trial: Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440. In the present case, the tender of Exhibit 5 involved the inadvertent tender in the defence case of potentially very prejudicial material which occurred by reason of an oversight by counsel then appearing for the appellant. 

266In a determination of the application, important considerations include the seriousness of the material tendered in the context of the contested issues, the stage at which the inadvertent tender occurred, the deliberateness of the conduct and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact: Crofts (supra) at 440.

267In the evaluation of these and other considerations, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge: Crofts (supra) at 440. The expression ""other considerations"" include, in particular, the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading the transcript: Crofts (supra) at 440 to 441.

268However, standing alongside or overlying these principles remains the duty of an appellate court where the exercise of the discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged. The duty is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind (Crofts (supra) at 441):-

""... The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate courts say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable? ...""

269An important consideration is, of course, the nature of the statements said to have given rise to the prejudice from the tender of the particular parts or passages of the articles and the relevance of those statements to the issues in the proceedings.

270One issue is whether the statements may be of a character that can be fairly classed as ""highly prejudicial"" or even ""inflammatory"": Crofts (supra) at 441. In that respect, it is necessary to consider whether there was special difficulty in the trial judge fashioning a direction to the jury which would help them to eradicate from their minds any highly prejudicial statements contained in the articles, noting that ""... it is always difficult to expunge prejudice from the mind, especially where it is expressed vividly in terms of facts"": Crofts (supra) at 441.

271Where highly prejudicial evidence is wrongly admitted and that evidence is central to the issues to be determined at the trial, a real question arises in this case as to whether the jury should have been discharged: see generally Maric v The Queen (1978) 52 ALJR 631 at 635.

272Wrongly admitted evidence which can be said to be damning evidence may not be capable of remedy by trial directions. In other words, such damage as was caused by the admission of the evidence may not be capable of being undone: Maric (supra) at 635.

273In the present case, the direction given to the jury did, of course, refer expressly to the evidence that had been wrongly admitted. This was necessary, given the nature of the evidence, so as to ensure the jury had their minds properly focused on the point of the directions. A dilemma, however, arises in that respect. A direction which refers to the objectionable evidence thereby may have the effect of impressing the evidence on the minds of the jurors: Maric (supra) at 635.

274In evaluating the trial judge's decision to refuse the application for a discharge, as earlier indicated, evidence may be so damaging that no directions may be capable of removing its detrimental effect. In such cases, the only course open to a trial judge in those circumstances is to discharge the jury: Maric (supra) at 635.

275The discretion in a trial judge to determine whether or not the jury should be discharged is then one to be exercised according to the circumstances of the particular case. In cases where there has been an irregular disclosure, unless it can be said that such disclosure could not in any way affect the judgment of the jury in coming to their decision of guilty or not guilty, it has been observed that the trial judge should exercise his discretion in favour of the accused: R v Knape [1965] VR 469 at 472-474 (Winneke CJ, Pape and Stark JJ).

276Accordingly, whilst the authorities have established principles for the exercise of the discretion by a trial judge to discharge a jury, they do not purport to prescribe or lay down principles as to how the discretion ought be exercised.

277In Knape (supra) at 474, it was noted in the joint judgment:-

""In this case, having regard to the prejudicial nature of the objectionable disclosure, and to the fact that it is apparent that it destroyed the underlying basis of the defence, we find it impossible to say that the jury would inevitably, or without doubt, have convicted if such inadmissible evidence had not been given, and accordingly, the Crown has not satisfied us that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.""

278However, in R v Hortis [2004] VSCA 143, the Supreme Court of Victoria (Court of Appeal) expressed its disagreement with the principle as stated in Knape (supra) stating at [18]-[19] per Nettle JA:-

""... the informing of principle is one which places responsibility on the trial judge to determine in light of the nature of the trial and the extent of the prejudice caused by the disclosure whether it is necessary to discharge the jury in the interests of ensuring a fair trial.

That approach was sanctioned by the High Court in Crofts v The Queen, in which it was said that much depends on the seriousness of the occasion in the context of the contested issues, the stage at which the mishap occurs, the deliberateness of the conduct, and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. The point was reiterated by this Court in R v Su. There are no rigid rules. The principle is one of necessity. There must be a high degree of need for discharge before that course should be adopted.""

279In R v Halliday [2009] VSCA 195 at [60] the Victorian Court of Appeal stated that the question to be considered in the circumstances as occurred in Knape (supra), is whether there is a ""high degree of necessity"" for the jury to be discharged.

280It is clear that the discretion in a trial judge is intended to be ""broad and general"": Halliday (supra) at [63]. It was there noted, at [65], that this test was originally stated as far back as Winsor v R (1866) LR 1 QB 390. Reference was also made to R v Weaver [1967] 1 QB 353. The Court in Halliday (supra) stated that that principle had been endorsed by the High Court and was therefore binding on the Victorian Court of Appeal.

281The statements contained in the material tendered in the appellant's case and the source or sources of such material require close examination.

282As earlier noted, the magazines (p.5, Issue 2, Volume 10, July - September 2003 and pp.4-5 of Issue 3, Volume 10, June - August 2004) included references to allegations that the appellant had links to al-Qaeda and had been involved in the financing of overseas bombings, allegations that brought strong and early denials and refutations on behalf of the appellant.

283The first document was a ""Media Release"" entitled ""Four Corners Missed the Target"" in the magazine, The Call of Islam, issued 10 July/September 2003 refuting allegations aired in the Four Corners programme, ""The Australian Connections"". The media release, in refuting the allegations, referred to the allegations as having included references concerning the appellant, inter alia, as a leader of al-Qaeda in Australia, that he had been trained in Afghanistan and that he was a financier of a named terrorist organisation in South Lebanon and that he was planning for terrorist attacks in the Philippines and Venezuela. The ""source"" of the intelligence on these matters was identified in the Four Corners programme as a CIA report. The media release published the next day, as I have noted, strongly refuted the allegations.

284The second article was entitled ""No Evidence Just Fabrication against Belal Khazaal"" was dated June/August 2004 and was in similar terms to the above media release.

285The Crown accepted and stated that there was no evidence that the appellant was a member of al-Qaeda.

286In the Crown's closing address, reference was made to the magazines including the following observations at t.807, line 25 to t.808, line 34)

""There are only two more brief references in exhibit 5. I am going to go to July to September 2003, page 5, an article entitled 'Four Corners missed the target'. It identifies a Four Corners programme of June 2003 said to be titled 'The Australian connections'. The response is that this programme just fans propaganda and hatred against Islam and Muslims. That may be a fair political comment. People can have that sort of response. They do not have to like Four Corners either. But, in the context of the actual article responding to Four Corners, they record that: 'Sally Neighbour of Four Corners identified Bilal Khazaal, one of the members of the Islamic Youth Movement, as the leader of al-Qaeda in Australia, claiming that he had been trained in Afghanistan ... and that he was planning for terrorist attacks in the Philippines and Venezuela'.

One reason for drawing attention to this is: Please do not think, because the magazine itself contains an allegation in Four Corners by Sally Neighbour or anyone else against Mr Khazaal that you can act on that. We are submitting that you do not act on that. We did not tender exhibit 5. Care needs to be exercised. Merely because the ABC reports something that this is responding to - it is saying it is not right - merely because the ABC reports something, you cannot use that against Mr Khazaal. That is just a news report. Do you follow what I mean? I am sure you do. I think I have made the point.

They say: 'For the record, Bilal Khazaal is a member of the IYM, Islamic Youth Movement'. The significance for the Crown is that this magazine records that Bilal Khazaal is a member of the IYM. Forget this allegation of Sally Neighbour. That is no part of the Crown case whatever against Mr Khazaal. But where the magazine is tendered in his case, it records that he is a member of the Islamic Youth Movement. The Crown submits it is fair of you to accept that.

The article goes on to say that Four Corners is completely wrong. My point is just to refer to this statement that he is a member of the Islamic Youth Movement.

At page 4 there is another defence of Bilal Khazaal. He is entitled to defend himself, if Four Corners has attacked him. This trial is not about what happened on the media, on television, or in a response. In this example, we did not put it in. Exercise care please, or there could be an unintended unfairness.

Finally today, if I may just very briefly refer to the last issue in exhibit 5, June to August 2004, again commencing at page 4, 'No evidence, just fabrications, against Bilal Khazaal'. We do not want you to take account of this kind of debate between the magazine and Four Corners or 60 Minutes in any part of your deliberations as to whether or not the Crown has proved these two charges beyond reasonable doubt. But we do draw your attention to the fact that in this edition it commences: 'It is now in the open. A member of the Lakemba based Islamic Youth Movement (IYM) Bilal Khazaal and this brother ... lies and false accusations', et cetera.

Our point is that this magazine describes the accused as a member of the Islamic Youth Movement, and I will relate that to some evidence about him being involved in a publication, and hence assuming some responsibility for the content of these magazines.""

Conclusion

287The allegations made in the material published in the Four Corners programme can, in my opinion, only be characterised as ""highly prejudicial"". In particular, they were directly relevant to issues in the trial. These included, firstly, the issue as to whether the book possessed the character of a document that could assist in a terrorist act, secondly, whether the appellant knew of the connection in that respect and, thirdly, their impact upon any possible defence that may have become available in accordance with the provisions of s.101.5(5) which would involve the appellant's state of mind.

288The Crown acknowledged that there was no evidence of any direct link or association between the appellant and al-Qaeda. It contended any association he had was an indirect one by reason of his membership of the Islamic Youth Movement (the publisher of the Call of Islam magazine and being a contributor to it). The Crown made it clear that it did not contend that the appellant was directly linked to the al-Qaeda organisation. The particular vice in the material published by the Four Corners programme and republished in the articles was not merely that it contained allegations by an ABC journalist that was adverse to the appellant, but that the Four Corners programme was said to have had as its source an alleged report made by the CIA. In other words, the allegations were expressly presented as made on the basis of material of a well-known intelligence agency.

289The material broadcast on the Four Corners programme constituted allegations, repeated in the articles, to the effect, that the appellant had been involved in past criminal activities. In particular, the allegations were to the effect that he had participated in terrorist activities involving extremely serious criminality. Such material could, in my opinion, only properly be classified as ""highly prejudicial"". The fact that the appellant rebutted or denied the allegations could not, in my opinion, be said to have neutralised the alarming nature of the allegations said to have been sourced to a CIA report.

290Taken in conjunction with the allegation concerning the allegation of a direct association with al-Qaeda, the material in the articles, in my assessment, was such as to destroy any prospect of a fair trial.

291In summary:-

(1) The material referred to in the articles was highly prejudicial to the appellant, firstly, by reason of the nature of the allegations directed against him and, secondly, by the statement of the journalist as to the alleged source for the allegations (the CIA).

(2) Evidence of the kind referred to in (1) is calculated to render a fair trial improbable. The articles were in the possession of the jury for a number of days before the application for the discharge was made and remained with the jury thereafter. I note that express reference was later made to the prejudicial material in closing addresses when other matters were referred to by counsel.

(3) It cannot, in my opinion, be said that such prejudicial allegations referred to in the tendered articles could not affect the judgment of the jury in coming to their decision of guilty or not guilty.

(4) Directions to the jury to put the articles out of mind and to the effect that they were not to be taken into account could not operate to remove the impact of such highly prejudicial allegations, particularly having regard to the fact that the allegations concerned alleged terrorist activities by the appellant himself when he was being tried for a terrorist offence.

(5) The effect of the material in the articles was to effectively destroy the underlying basis for the defence. The fact that the articles contained strong rebuttals and denials by the appellant could not be considered to have neutralised the nature and severity of the allegations made.

(6) In the above circumstances, in my assessment, consistent with the right every accused person has to a fair trial conducted according to law, the discretion of the trial judge could only have been exercised in favour of discharging the jury and a new trial ordered.

292I have concluded that the trial judge's decision to refuse the application for a discharge of the jury was, with respect, an erroneous exercise of the discretion. Although the material was tendered in the defence case, it was done by the inadvertence of the appellant's counsel. The material in the prejudicial articles expressly having identified the appellant as the subject of allegations said to have been based upon a CIA report, was, in my opinion, so damaging that no directions from the trial judge were capable of removing its detrimental effect. Accordingly, in my opinion, the only course open to the trial judge in those circumstances was to discharge the jury.

293I, accordingly, would uphold Ground 1 of the appeal.

Ground 2: Alleged misdirection with respect to delay by authorities in seeking the removal of the book from the Al Maqdessy website

294The issue raised by this ground concerns a period of time between the detection of the book on the website and its removal in May 2004.

295It was contended on behalf of the appellant that ASIO and the Australian Federal Police had delayed in removing the e-book from the internet even though they had known that it had been uploaded onto the abovementioned website in September 2003. The delay, it was contended, was evidence which the jury were entitled to conclude meant that the elements of the charge had not been established.

296In the submissions for the appellant, it was contended that there was no evidence that any steps had been taken to cause the removal of the book from the internet and that, indeed, its removal appeared only to have occurred because of the actions of the appellant one month after he was compulsorily interrogated by members of ASIO. The appellant's arrest, it was noted, did not take place for a further month.

297It was noted in the appellant's submissions that during the first portion of the summing up, the trial judge stated, in effect, that the jury should disregard the submission made by counsel on behalf of the appellant in relation to this matter, instead explaining that any delay was the result of the time required by the Australian Federal Police to obtain a proper translation.

298In the appellant's submissions, it was stated that the clear purpose of the evidence was to show that the document (the book) had not been considered by the abovementioned authorities to be helpful and, hence, that it was less likely to be connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in or assistance in a terrorist act.

299In the Crown's submissions, the relevant chronology was set out. This indicates:-

(1) The appellant had been interviewed by members of ASIO over a period of 10 days concluding on 23 April 2004.

(2) Search warrants had been executed on the appellants home on 6 May 2004 and, on 9 May 2004, a request was made by the appellant that the book be removed from the website.

(3) On 22 June 2004, he was arrested and charged.

300I accept the Crown submission that there was no evidence that there were means available to ASIO or the Australian Federal Police to compel removal of the book from the website. On that basis, the contention of delay by the authorities was always a doubtful proposition.

301I additionally accept the submission for the Crown that the jury was not entitled to infer that ""the authorities"" took no action to get the book removed from the website in the absence of evidence that they had the means for doing so. No suggestion had been put to either Mr Roden or the Federal Agent, Redfern, to the effect that their respective organisations had any power or control in respect of the content on the Al Maqdessy website and further it was not put to them that they had the belief or opinion that the book on the website did not constitute an imminent danger.

302I do not consider that there is any merit in relation to this ground.

Ground 3: Alleged misdirection with respect to the words ""is connected with""

303In considering this ground, it is necessary to restate the elements of the offence in question.

304An offence under s.101.5(1) involves the following elements:-

(1) A person (the appellant) does something - makes a document (the physical element of the offence: s.101.5(1)(a)).

(2) The document ""is connected with"" one or more of the following:-

(a) preparation for a terrorist act;

(b) the engagement of a person in a terrorist act;

(c) assistance in a terrorist act: s.101.5(1)(b);

and

(3) That person:-

(a) knows of the connection referred to in (2): s.101.5(1)(c) (the fault element).

305The connection element referred to in (2) above refers to a connection between a document and one or more of the actions referred to in (2) - each being a purposeful action that is likely to facilitate a terrorist act.

306In the present case, the connection is said to have been between the document (or the book) and ""assistance in a terrorist act"".

307In terms of the fault element under s.101.5(1)(c), the Crown must establish that the appellant knew certain facts sufficient to know of the connection described in s.101.5(1)(b).

Appellant's submissions

308In the submissions for the appellant, it was contended that the phrase ""in connection with"" is capable of carrying a broad meaning but that it always takes its colour from its surroundings. Reliance was placed upon dicta of Spigelman CJ in R v Orcher [1999] NSWCCA 356 at [28]; (1999) 48 NSWLR 273 at 278.

309It was further contended that it was particularly relevant that the phrase appeared in a ""highly penal provision"". Further, it was submitted that, in the criminal context, there must be ""in a very real sense"" a link, that is, a ""substantial connection"" between the document and the terrorist act.

310It was contended that the trial judge's direction that the words ""connected with"" could be taken to carry the ordinary meaning of the words did not provide the requisite guidance and did not inform the jury as to the role the connection element played in the offence.

311Mr Barker QC, who appeared with Mr P Lange of counsel on behalf of the appellant, submitted that, having regard to the inability of the jury to reach a verdict in respect of Count 2, they appeared to have attached ""the most tenuous meaning to the phrase 'connected with' ..."" (transcript, 6 October 2010, p.6).

312Mr Barker also contended that it was dangerous to leave to the jury the words constituting the connection element without the requisite instruction and guidance. The words ""in connection with"", he contended, must be construed in their context and that a mere or remote connection will not suffice. He submitted that a narrow, rather than a broad, interpretation should be adopted and that that would be achieved by construing the phrase as meaning ""directly connected with"" (transcript, 6 October 2010, p.7).

313Following the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, the parties were invited to make further submissions in light of the subsequent judgment of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Benbrika & Ors v The Queen [2010] VSCA 281; (2010) 247 FLR 1. In the further submissions on behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that the three requirements specified in Benbrika (supra) at [315] could be readily transposed to the present case, it being emphasised that there must be a terrorist act, which is either proposed or contemplated. Additionally, some activity, which assists that terrorist act, it was argued, must be underway, proposed or contemplated. Finally, the thing (the document) must be used or intended to be used in aid, or as part of, that assistance. The submission, accordingly, was that only where all three of those elements have been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution can it be said that the document was connected with a terrorist act.

314It was also contended that, contrary to the Crown's earlier submissions, the approach taken in Benbrika (supra) emphasised that the appellant's intention was a matter that could be taken into account, relying upon the observations in that case at [317] and [318]. In other words, the ""connection"" was stated to be a function of the intention or purpose which must be shown to have existed - in that case, at the time of possession, with respect to both the terrorist act and the use of the thing.

315It was, accordingly, contended that the reasoning in Benbrika (supra) applied to an offence under s.101.5(1) and to the term ""assistance in"" as opposed to ""preparation for"" a terrorist act. 

316Finally, reference was made to the principle that the High Court had made it clear that intermediate appellate courts should not depart from an interpretation of a uniform national legislation by another Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that the interpretation was plainly wrong: Benbrika (supra) at [116], citing with approval Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Limited [1993] HCA 15; (1993) 177 CLR 485. Reliance was also placed upon the observations of the High Court in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [57]; (2010) 85 ALJR 195 at 207 and R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272 at [87] (2007) 175 A Crim R 108 at 127 per Spigelman CJ.

317It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the reasoning of the Victorian Court of Appeal was not clearly wrong and, accordingly, should be followed by this Court.

Crown submissions

318It was submitted for the Crown that the meaning of ""connected with"" as used in sub-section (1)(b) was not influenced by authorities which circumscribe the meaning of that phrase as used in other penal statutes. 

319According to the Crown submission, an offence under that sub-section, falls to be determined according to the ordinary meaning of the words in the English language. Reliance was placed upon the trial directions given by Whealy J in R v Lodhi (2005/1094, reproduced at AB 540) which it was contended supported the trial judge's direction in the present case. In accordance with the directions in Whealy J's summing up in Lodhi (supra), it was submitted, no special or technical meaning is to be given to the phrase.

320The Crown took issue with the submission for the appellant that the expression required ""a close nexus between the document and the (terrorist) action"". It observed that it had been submitted on behalf of the appellant before the trial judge that the jury should be given a direction in the following terms:-

""You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the book was connected with assistance in a terrorist act. The words 'connected with' mean that the book must itself have been capable of directly assisting in the commission of a terrorist act. A mere remote connection will not suffice. The word 'assistance' is, of course, a word that is used in everyday language and is to be understood in that sense, that is, aiding, making easier or facilitating.""

321The Crown argued that the additional directions sought by the appellant sought to introduce a reference to the appellant's intention with respect to his purpose in making the book when that was not an element of the Count 1 offence.

322Finally, the Crown disputed the appellant's contention that the words ""connected with"" are of such wide meaning in their ordinary usage, in the context of s.101.5(1)(b), that there was a requirement for a trial judge to direct the jury as to a restricted meaning to be applied to them. It was also contended that the appellant was bound by his application for the directions reproduced at AB 2/555-6.

323In response to the further submissions made on behalf of the appellant and, in particular, in relation to the judgment of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Benbrika (supra), the Crown submitted that it was not appropriate to transpose the Court's criteria in Benbrika (supra) at [315] for the possession of a thing to be ""connected with preparation for a terrorist act"" under s.101.4(1) as the criteria for making a document ""connected with assistance in a terrorist act"" under s.101.5(1) because of ""... the qualitative difference between the two kinds of conduct"": Crown's submissions in response to the further submissions for the appellant (at [12]).

324The submission referred to the observation of the Court in Benbrika (supra) at [314] that a ""thing"" being an inanimate object, says nothing as to the reason it is possessed. However, a document was said to be of a different character. Making a document necessarily invests the maker with knowledge of its content at the time it is made (at [12]).

325The Crown observed that, whilst a thing per se has no intellectual component beyond an intention to possess it, making a document (absent outside directive, as in the present case) required intellectual input into its content (at [14]):-

""... A document cannot be made without the maker deciding upon its composition and/or compilation. The maker therefore knows both the content of the document at the time it is made and his or her purpose in making it. Evidence of what is done during the process of making the document can also evidence the maker's knowledge of how that purpose is to be achieved.""

326The Crown submitted that where, as in the present case, the content of the document (at [15]):-

""... can fairly be construed as a call to terrorist arms, and where the maker sends drafts of it to a known terrorist website with urgings for the final document to be posted on the website, a connection between making the document and assistance in a terrorist act exists; further, the maker knows of the connection""

327The Crown, additionally, drew attention to the particular direction given by the trial judge as to the meaning of the phrase ""connected with assistance in an action or threat of action"" which was given in the context of the evidence in the case. It was emphasised that the direction to interpret that phrase according to its plain English meaning was one associated with the direction that the jury had to be satisfied that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt, inter alia, that the document the appellant intentionally made was connected with assistance in an action or threat of action, being conducted against any one or more of a number of persons, including diplomats, military personnel and holders of public office in the manner set out in detail in the written directions.

328The Crown further argued that the fault identified in Benbrika (supra) of a failure to identify what had to be proved for the requisite connection to be established did not occur in the present case. It was submitted that the trial judge's direction precisely identified what had to be proved to establish the fact that when the appellant made the document he knew of its connection with assistance in a terrorist act. The trial judge's direction in the present case, it was submitted, contained no error. Alternatively, any error was inconsequential in the context of the full direction. It did not lead to a miscarriage of justice (at [17]).

Consideration

329In determining the meaning of the expression ""is connected with"", s.105.5(1)(b) refers to a document that ""is"" connected with assistance in a terrorist act. It does not state, for example, that the document ""could have"" or ""may have"" a connection with a terrorist act.

330A provision such as s.101.5(1), as Spigelman CJ observed in Lodhi v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 121 at [65] to [66]; (2006) 199 FLR 303 at 318 is directed to the preliminary steps for action which may have one or more effects. The legislative regime established by the provisions in Part 5.3 of Chapter 5 is directed at criminalising what may be termed preparatory acts. It is clear that the intention of the Parliament was to create offences even where the offender, who intended to commit a terrorist act, has not decided precisely what he or she intends to do:-

""A policy judgment has been made that the prevention of terrorism requires criminal responsibility to arise at an earlier stage than is usually the case for other kinds of criminal conduct, eg, well before an agreement has been reached for a conspiracy charge ...""

331A terrorist act, whether it is the act of an individual or the act of a number of persons conspiring together, will usually involve varying degrees of planning and a number of acts of preparation. 

332A person charged with an offence under s.101.5(1)(b), as earlier noted, must be shown to have known of the connection between the document and the assistance in a terrorist act. This provision, properly construed, means that, whilst a person prosecuted under that provision may be unaware of a specific target for a terrorist act, he or she may have knowledge of certain facts concerning a terrorist act in contemplation or an existing proposal, decision, plan or preparatory acts to commit a terrorist act.

333Accordingly, in order to prove the offence, there must be circumstances established in evidence of a connection, that is, a link, an association or a relationship between the making of a document and assistance in a terrorist act. The phrase ""is connected with"" may apply to a connection between a document and either a preparatory stage for a terrorist act or to the actual implementation of such an act.

(1) The reasons for judgment in Benbrika & Ors v The Queen

334In Benbrika (supra), Maxwell P, Nettle and Weinberg JJA considered, inter alia, appeals by two men against their convictions for an offence of possessing ""a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act"" being an offence under s.101.4(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

335In Benbrika (supra), the Crown case at trial was that the applicants were members of a Melbourne-based terrorist organisation, which was fostering or preparing for the doing of a terrorist act in Australia or overseas, with the intention of causing death or serious physical harm in order to advance a political, religious or ideological cause. The cause to be advanced by terrorist action in that case was said to be the belief - taught by Benbrika and accepted by members of the organisation - that they were under a religious obligation to pursue violent Jihad against the kuffar (non-believers).

336During investigations, police executed a search warrant at Benbrika's home and located a number of audio cassettes and other material. Amongst the CDs were two copies of a CD with a handwritten label entitled ""Supporters of Shariah Islamic Info Lectures, Mansura Movies of Shuuhaddah [sic] and heaps more"" (referred to as the ""Mansura CD"").

337The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge had erred in the directions given as to the nature of the connection which must be proved in an offence under s.101.4(1)(b).

338The Court there posed the question as to what will determine whether the requisite connection exists. In that respect, the Court stated there were three requirements (at [315]):-

""... It seems to us that, as a matter of ordinary language, a thing cannot be said to be 'connected with preparation for a terrorist act' unless:-

(a) a terrorist act is proposed or contemplated (whether or not a decision has been made as to what kind of terrorist act it will be);

(b) some activity in preparation for that terrorist act is underway, or is proposed, or contemplated (whether or not a decision has been made as to what kind of activity that will be) ('preparatory activity'); and

(c) the thing is being used, or is intended to be used, in aid of that preparatory activity.""

339The Court stated that the requirement for some preparatory activity to be underway or in contemplation flowed from the key words ""connected with preparation"" (at [316] to [317]):-

""... Had Parliament had in mind to criminalise the possession of articles which might be suitable for use should such a preparatory activity be undertaken, then quite different statutory language would have been appropriate. Parliament could, for example, have adopted the language of s.58(1) of the Terrorist Act 2006 (UK), which makes it an offence to collect or record 'information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism'. A provision of that kind would direct attention to the characteristics of the thing possessed, and would pose what is, in essence, a hypothetical question, namely:-

'If a person was committing or preparing an act of terrorism, would an act of this kind be likely to be useful to that person?'

The third requirement likewise follows from the words 'connected with preparation'. Plainly, it could not be sufficient simply to establish that preparatory activity was underway or in contemplation. For the thing to be connected with that preparatory activity, it must be shown that it was being used, or was intended by someone (whether or not by the possessor of the article) to be used, in aid of that preparatory activity.""

340The Court of Appeal in Benbrika (supra) emphasised that the ""connection"" which the section requires is not a property of the thing itself. The connection, the Court emphasised, is a function of the intention or purpose which must be shown to have existed (at the time of possession), with respect to both a terrorist act and the use of the thing. As I indicate below, the same may be said of certain documents.

341I will return below to the reasons for judgment of the Court in Benbrika (supra) in relation to interpretative principles in relation to the connection element of the offence.

(2) The reasoning in Benbrika applies to an offence under s.101(5)(1)(b)

342The reasoning of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Benbrika (supra) is instructive in relation to Ground 3 although the particular offence in question in that case was one under s.101.4 and not s.101.5. However, the terms are companion provisions and employ similar expressions. The Victorian Court of Appeal observed (at [318]):-

""The fact that the item in question was capable of being used, or was suitable for use, in connection with a terrorist act could not be enough. As we have said, the 'connection' which the section requires is not a property of the thing itself. The connection is a function of the intention or purpose which must be shown to have existed (at the time of possession), with respect to both the terrorist act and the use of the thing."" (emphasis added)

343Applying the analysis employed by the Court in Benbrika (supra) to a s.101.5(1)(b) offence, if there was no evidence that anyone had in contemplation or was planning or proposing or preparing for a terrorist act at the time the document (namely, the book) was made in this case, then it must follow that there would be no evidence capable of establishing a connection between the making of the book and a terrorist act.

344The Court of Appeal in its analysis in Benbrika (supra) emphasised that the words ""connected with"" cannot be construed in isolation from their context (at [323]).

345Whilst in that case the Court stated that it is erroneous to ask whether the connection must be shown to have been a ""direct"" one, it acknowledged that it could be argued that what Parliament had in mind when it spoke of the need for the thing to be ""connected with"", relevantly, preparation for a terrorist act, was a ""real and substantial connection"", and not one that was peripheral. The Court emphasised, however, that this was not to adopt a test of ""directness"", stating (at [324]):-

""... The question is not, as the English cases suggest, whether there is a direct connection between the thing and the act of preparation. It is rather whether the connection, as manifested in all of the circumstances of the case, is sufficiently tangible to fall, properly and sensibly, within the meaning of the term 'connected with'.

346The analysis of principle in the context of s.101.4(5) emphasises that, in an offence under that provision dealing with possession, circumstances may exist in which a person is in possession of an object which is capable of being used (for example, the preparation of a bomb) but exculpatory circumstances may also exist which would then engage the defence under s.101.4(5). The exculpatory circumstance is not an objective feature of the object in the possession of the person concerned but rather is the absence of a subjective purpose linking the defendant's possession of it with the preparation for the terrorist act. The person, accordingly, may lead evidence that, for example, it was simply an accident of circumstance that he was in possession of the material in question and that the possession was not for any purpose associated with the terrorist activity.

347I am of the opinion that similar reasoning is to be applied in the interpretation and application of s.101.5(1)(b) of the Code. In particular, the analysis in Benbrika (supra), with respect, convincingly reveals why, as the Court observed, it is erroneous to construe the words ""connected with"" in isolation from their context. It is only when considered in context that the particular meaning of the phrase can be derived.

(3) Application of interpretative principles to broad expressions in a criminal statute

348In Orcher (supra), Spigelman CJ considered an issue of interpretation in relation to an offence under s.326(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. An offence under that provision relates to threatened action on account of anything lawfully done by a person ""... as a public justice official in or in connection with any judicial proceeding"".

349The Chief Justice observed (at 278):-

""The second question in the stated case turns on the proper construction of the words 'in connection with any judicial proceedings'. Words of such generality are often read down in the process of interpretation: see, eg, R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 618 at 689 [22]-[25], ...

The phrase 'in connection with' is capable of considerable breadth, however, it always takes its colour from its surroundings. The full scope of the dictionary definition is rarely, if ever, appropriate.""

350In the article, Principle of Legality and the Clear Statement Principle (2005) 79 ALJ 769, the author, Spigelman CJ, referred to the observations of Lord Simon of Glaisdale (described as ""a master of statutory interpretation""):-

""Words and phrases of the English language have an extraordinary range of meaning. This has been a rich resource in English poetry (which makes fruitful use of the resonances, overtones and ambiguities), but has a concomitant disadvantage in English law (which seeks unambiguous precision, with the aim that every citizen shall know as exactly as possible, where he stands under the law: Stock v Frank Jones (Tipton) Limited (1978) 1 WLR 231 at 236.""

351In the last-mentioned article, the Chief Justice stated (at 772):-

""While all statutory interpretation is text based, it has long been accepted that the words of the text must be understood in their context. The words do not exist in limbo ... As Professor Sunstein has put it:-

'Legal words are never susceptible to interpretation standing by themselves, and in any case they never stand by themselves.'

Context is always important ...""

352In Benbrika (supra), the Court proceeded to state in relation to s.101.4 (at [334]):-

""... The question is not whether the connection has to be (and be proved to be) a 'direct' connection. The question is whether the requisite purpose existed (at the relevant time) with respect to the thing possessed, so as to connect it in the relevant sense with a terrorist act.""

353A little later, the Court stated (at [338] and [339]):-

""As pointed out earlier, for a relevant connection to have existed, there had to be a terrorist act for which the preparatory activity was underway or in contemplation. Otherwise there was no 'terrorist act' with which the thing in question could be shown to have had a connection ...

...

However, his Honour then failed to direct the jury as to how to determine whether the Mansura CD had the requisite connection with that preparatory activity. Doubtless reflecting the submissions advanced on both sides, his Honour construed the phrase 'connected with' in isolation from its legislative context, which led him to tell the jury that",2011-06-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757181,R v Ryan Christopher WILLIAMS [2011] NSWSC 583,"Judgment 

1The offender, Ryan Christopher Williams stands for sentence in relation to the murder of Shana Joy Wilkinson at Corowa on 18 September 2009. He pleaded guilty to the charge in the Local Court in 2010 and adhered to that plea when he first appeared in this Court and when the matter came on for hearing in May 2011. 

2The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is life imprisonment. The Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment for the offence under s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ('the Act'). A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison for the offence, before being released on parole for the balance of the sentence. The standard non-parole period fixed by the Act applies to an offence falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences. 

3Section 44(2) of the Act specifies that '[t]he balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more'. If there is to be any adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve (see Power v R [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628). 

The circumstances of this offence 

4Ms Wilkinson died on 18 September 2009 as the result of a number of blows which the offender inflicted, using a shovel, with asphyxiation also contributing to her death. The offender confessed to her murder on 24 September 2009, when being questioned by police. There is no dispute about the facts set out in an agreed statement of facts, which is in evidence. In addition, there is in evidence statements made by arresting police officers, the offender's girlfriend and his father, as well as an autopsy report, records relating to the offender's personal history, as well as psychiatric and other reports. The offender's mother was also called to give oral evidence. 

5The offender himself did not give evidence at the hearing. He had earlier declined to make a statement to the police. He has given two brief accounts of the circumstances of the murder. The first to arresting police officers and the second to the psychiatrist, Dr Westmore. Those accounts conflict. 

6The agreed statement of facts revealed that: 
""On Sunday 20 September 2009, Margaret Wilkinson reported to Corowa Police that her daughter Shana Joy Wilkinson (the deceased) was missing. Mrs Wilkinson last saw the deceased at their home at XXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, Corowa around 9.30pm on Friday 18 September 2009. The deceased was watching television with a friend Mikhael Hynes (Hynes). 

Mrs Wilkinson made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the deceased on her mobile telephone on Saturday 19 and Sunday 20 September. Mrs Wilkinson reported that the deceased's handbag and wallet were still in her bedroom. 

The deceased failed to attend work at Corowa Target store on Saturday 19 September 2009. The deceased also failed to attend classes at the Australian College of Beauty and Hair Design, Wodonga on Monday 21 September 2009. 

Mrs Wilkinson found the deceased's telephone directory in her bedroom and rang some friends of the deceased. Mrs Wilkinson rang Ryan Williams (the offender). The offender told Mrs Wilkinson that he picked the deceased up at home around 11pm on Friday night and he dropped her off near Edward Street and Federation Drive as she was going to see a mate. The offender was the last person to see the deceased. 

On Monday 21 September 2009, Police received an area identifying the triangulation of the deceased's mobile telephone between Corowa, Wahgunyah and Rutherglen. On Tuesday 22 September 2009, NSW and Victorian Police, the State Emergency Service (SES) and the local Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA) commenced searching for the deceased within the area indicated from the mobile telephone triangulation, in particular the Murray River and its banks. 

Simultaneously, Police notified local media outlets and conducted several media interviews seeking assistance and information in locating the deceased. On 22 September 2009, the offender was contacted by the VRA to assist with the search. The offender attended VRA Headquarters around 1pm and assisted with the search of the river bank. 

As part of the investigation, Police interviewed friends of the deceased, including the offender. Police contacted the offender on 22 September 2009, whilst he was searching for the deceased. 

Around 4pm on 22 September 2009, the offender attended VRA Headquarters and participated in an Electronically Recorded Interview with Police. The offender told Police that the deceased sent him a text message on Friday night and then later rang him and she sounded upset so he went to see her. When he arrived at the deceased's home, she had been drinking. The offender took the deceased for a drive and talked and the deceased indicated that she wanted to rekindle their relationship. The offender declined as he had moved on with a new girlfriend. The offender stopped his vehicle on Federation Avenue, at the request of the deceased. The deceased got out of the car and said that she was going to see a mate. The offender stated that he dropped the deceased off around 11pm. 

Despite extensive searches of the Murray River and surrounds, the deceased was not located. 

Telephone records confirm that the offender was the last person to have telephone contact with the deceased. 

On Thursday 24 September 2009, Police were granted a Crime Scene Warrant for the offender's motor vehicle, a white Ford Falcon sedan NSW registration XXX XXX. Around 2pm on Thursday 24 September 2009, Police spoke to the offender, in the presence of his father Graham Williams, in Sanger Street, Corowa. 

During this conversation, the offender told Police ""...it looks pretty bad for me. I was the last one to see her alive and they haven't found her body"". The offender corrected himself and stated ""No, I mean they haven't found Shana. I've been out with the VRA looking for her"". Police advised the offender that they had a Crime Scene Warrant and intended to seize his motor vehicle. The offender and Mr Williams accompanied Police to his address at XXX XXXX XXXXXX, Corowa. The warrant was executed and the vehicle was seized. 

Also at this address was a silver Ford Falcon Ute Victorian registration XXX XXX with a fibreglass canopy. The offender also owns this Ute. Mr Williams advised Police that they had seized the wrong vehicle as the offender was driving the silver Ute on Friday night. The offender confirmed this and told Police that ""I was really pissed and I didn't want to get into trouble. I was driving the ute on Friday"". The offender gave Police permission to seize the Ute for forensic examination. 

Whilst at the offender's residence, Police asked the offender (sic) recall what happened after he dropped the deceased off. After a short time the offender asked to speak to his father. Following this conversation, the offender again told Police ""I was driving my Ute and I dropped Shana off in Edward Street. I went home, I was really pissed and I shit myself and vomited up. I was really embarrassed and had a shower. I parked my Ute around the back behind the shed and then drove to my girlfriend's house"". 

The offender agreed to give Police the clothes that he said he was wearing on Friday night. Shortly after, Mr Williams said ""He strangled her"". The offender said ""I killed her"". The offender told Police that he buried the deceased near the Lagoon. The offender agreed to show Police the burial site. The offender was arrested and cautioned. 

The offender directed Police to a turning circle at the end of Enfield Road, Corowa. At this location, a steep bank led to a small lagoon known as 'Dairy Lagoon'. Police walked down the bank to the Lagoon but were unable to locate any obvious areas where soil had recently been turned. The offender identified an area not far from the waters edge. 

A short time later, the offender said to Police ""I didn't mean to do it. It started out as a joke but I couldn't stop squeezing"". The offender then demonstrated how he strangled the deceased in a headlock type position from behind. The offender told Police that he hit her with a shovel, took her clothes off and buried her. The offender also told Police that the deceased was dead before he hit her with the shovel. The offender said that he put his clothes and the deceased's clothes in a bag and put them in the roof of his house. 

The offender was conveyed to Corowa Police Station. After obtaining legal advice, the offender declined to answer any questions regarding the murder. The refusal to answer any questions was electronically recorded. The offender was charged. 

A crime scene was established at the burial site at 'Dairy Lagoon'. Crime Scene Officers (CSO) attended the burial site and dug a small hole in the area where the deceased was said to be buried. Approximately 570 millimetres below the surface, CSO located what appeared to be flesh. The crime scene remained under Police guard throughout the night. 

On the evening of Thursday 24 September 2009, Police applied for and were granted a Search Warrant in respect of the offender's premises at XXX XXXX XXXXXX, Cowora. The search warrant was executed during the evening of 24 September 2009. 

Police recovered a bag containing blood stained clothing belonging to the deceased and the offender from the roof cavity in the laundry. Police also seized six shovels from the rear shed. These items were subject to forensic analysis. A long brown handled shovel was examined. The neck of the blade, front and back and the blade, front and back produced a positive presumptive result for blood. DNA testing on the shovel was ultimately unsuccessful. 

The rear shed was subject to forensic examination. A presumptive test for blood was conducted on the interior of the shed. Some small spots on the floor inside the roller door produced a positive presumptive test for blood. These spots were swabbed and forwarded to DAL. Blood was not detected on this swab. 

Police and CSO returned to the burial site the following day, Friday 25 September 2009. The body of the deceased was uncovered, approximately 600 millimetres below ground level. The body was naked and laying face down. The body was removed and examined. Police observed a large laceration to the back of the head, a hole in the skull behind the left ear, a wound behind the right ear and a wound beside the right eye. 

An Autopsy Report reveals the cause of death to be blunt force injuries to the head. Asphyxia was found to be a significant contributing factor to the death. The following injuries to the head were noted: 


Large lacerations lateral to the right eye, scalp of the forehead and back of the skull; 
Comminuted fractures of the base of the skull; 
Fractures of the right frontal skull, left occipital skull and right orbit; 
The brain had small subarachnoid and subdural haemorrhages and contusions. 

The following asphyxial injuries were noted: 


Transverse bar-like area of blanching of the anterior neck, with adjacent, profuse petechial haemorrhage; 
Contusions on the skin of the front of the neck and the central posterior neck and the left posterior shoulder and right anterior shoulder; 
Subconjunctival haemorrhages, petechial haemorrhages or(sic) the oral mucosa and deep soft tissue haemorrhages within the neck. 

The black plastic bag containing the offender's and deceased's clothing was subject to fingerprint examination. The right middle fingerprint and right palm print of the offender were located on the exterior of the plastic garbage bag. Ridge detail consistent with the right middle finger of the offender was also located on the plastic bag. 

The offender's Ford Falcon sedan and Ford Falcon Ute were subject to forensic examination. A presumptive test for blood in the rear tray of the Ford Ute was conducted. A number of areas in the rear tray produced a positive result. DNA testing on a swab from the rear tray of the Ute was unsuccessful. A second swab was also examined. Blood was not detected on this swab. 

The offender's jeans located in the bag in the roof cavity at XXX XXXX XXXXX were subject to forensic examination. The deceased has the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from three stained areas of the jeans. This profile is expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion individuals. The DNA profile recovered from an unstained area inside the front waistband of the jeans is consistent with originating from the deceased. Traces of DNA from a second individual were recovered. The offender cannot be excluded as the second contributor. 

Semen was not detected on the rectal, nasal, oral or vaginal swab of the deceased."" 

7The autopsy report revealed no detectable alcohol or common drugs of abuse or prescribed drugs in Ms Wilkinson's body. 

8In evidence was a report prepared by the forensic psychiatrist Dr Westmore, who examined the offender on 23 December 2010. The account which Dr Westmore recorded the offender had given him was: 
""I asked him what happened on the night of the incident. He said it was about one week after his current girlfriend had a miscarriage. He said ""I'd been drinking pretty heavily all week and that night I really wrote meself off. She (Shana) rang me asking if I wanted to go for a drink. I went and picked her up (from her home). We were driving around for a bit and pulled over at the river, just talking. I told her how devastated I was at losing the baby. I was ready to be a father, built meself up to it. She said it was a good thing that it died, that it was a good thing that happened. That is when I got angry. I never really get angry like that, something was saying, I don't know how to explain it, something in me snapped I guess."" 

He continued and stated ""It shouldn't have happened in the first place. I realised what I'd done. I freaked out and I panicked and that is when I tried to get rid of her."" 

I told him the police indicate that he had said at some stage that he had strangled Shana and he said ""Yes, that is correct."" I told him I understood he had also stated at some stage that he had hit her with a shovel, he said yes. I enquired had there been any sexual intimacy between him and Shana on that particular night, he said no. 

I told him I understood she had been stripped naked and he said ""Correct."" I asked him why he done that and he said ""Panic I just wanted it all to go away, I was freaking out about going to gaol. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't believe I'd done something like that."" 

I asked him how much alcohol he had consumed on the night and he said he had consumed a large bottle of Jack Daniel, twelve schooners and he had smoked cannabis as well. I confirmed with him that he had consumed a whole bottle of spirits by himself and he said yes to that question. He then said ""I've been an alcoholic for years."" I enquired had he been heavily intoxicated on the night and he said ""Yes, I started drinking at quarter past three when I knocked off work. "" He said the incident occurred between 10.30pm and 11.00pm. He thought Shana had been drinking as well, he said he can remember that she had a bottle of wine with her. 

He had smoked a $20 packet of cannabis over a period of time leading up to the homicide."" 

9Later Dr Westmore noted: 

""I took him back to the offending behaviour and asked him what was he thinking at the time. He said ""Something was telling me, you can't let her talk like that, it wasn't the first baby that I'd lost. I was pretty built up to be a father. When she said she was glad it died, it wasn't even like anger, it was blind rage. I've never felt anything like it before."" 

I asked him did he think he had lost control on that particular night or not. He said ""Yeah, I think I did."" I enquired did he think that he would have lost control in the same way if he had not used drugs and alcohol that night. He said no. I asked him in the past when he had been aggressive, had it always been in conjunction with drug and alcohol use, he said yes."" 


10The offender's girlfriend's statement indicated that their relationship had existed for some three months. They had met at work and the offender was 'pretty much' living at her house. The relationship was good, they had never argued until recently and there had been no violence. Ms Wilkinson was a member of their friendship group. 

11On the night of the murder the offender's girlfriend had missed a call from the offender at 9.50pm, while she was at work. She finished work at 11.00pm and returned home, arriving a few minutes later. Between that time and 12.35pm she tried calling the offender eleven times without success and then went to bed. He arrived at her home at about 2.00am. He had been drunk every night over the preceding week, but she would not have described him as drunk that night. They had an argument. Her account was: 
""When he arrived, I was in bed. I said, ""Where the fuck have you been?"" 
He said, ""I picked up Shana and then I passed out ...."" 
I got angry as soon as he said her name and said, ""Don't even fuckin' talk to me."" 
He said, ""I didn't root her! I didn't do anything. She put the moves on but I told her how it was and that I was with you and then I dropped her off."" 

12The offender and his girlfriend spent the weekend doing chores and seeing friends. On Sunday afternoon he received a telephone call and told her that Ms Wilkinson was missing. On Monday he told her he had been called in to assist Corowa Search and Rescue, with which he had been involved for a few years, to assist in the search for Ms Wilkinson. After he returned she asked the offender to tell her everything about what had happened the previous Friday evening. He told her that they went to see friends, had driven around for a while and then he had dropped her off. 

13They discussed Ms Wilkinson further over the next few days and she encouraged him to tell all that he knew. He insisted that he had not done anything and that he was telling the truth. She believed him, because she did not believe that he would hurt anyone. She had never seen him angry. 

14The offender's father's statement indicated that he was at home on the night of the murder. He woke at about 1.30am and saw the offender outside walking toward the house, wearing only a pair of jeans. The offender was acting out of sorts and fobbed him off, going towards the shed. A little later when the offender entered the house, he was naked. The offender then had a shower and left about 30 minutes later. 

15The offender's mother, Ms McGeeham, gave an account of the offender's background, personal and employment history. 

16The offender is a 23 year old man who came from a close knit family. While his parents were divorced, he lived with his mother as a child and at the time of the offence, with his father in Corowa, when not with his girlfriend. His parents were both involved in his upbringing. He left school in year 11 to pursue an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. He enjoyed success in his studies and later worked in his trade in full-time contract work. He was named Victorian apprentice of the year in 2008. He had purchased his own home. He was actively engaged in a number of sports, had qualifications as a martial arts coach and was involved in volunteer work in search and rescue operations. 

17His mother's evidence was that she was aware that on occasions the offender drank to excess, but he was always able to maintain full-time employment; he had been careful not to drive while under the influence; and his drinking had not caused him to have any time off work. She, his father and his girlfriend maintain contact with him. 

18His mother first learned of his girlfriend's pregnancy and miscarriage, after the offender's arrest, even though they were close and had dinner together each week, including on the Tuesday before Ms Wilkinson's murder. He did not drink alcohol while with her that evening. Neither the offender nor his girlfriend then told her about the miscarriage. Their conversation had been about normal things, including what to do with a litter of puppies and travel plans. 

19She explained that she had only learnt of the death of the offender's prematurely born child, who had been born while the offender was living at home with her when he was 19, on the night before giving her evidence, when she read certain documents. That morning her daughter had revealed to her, her knowledge of the birth of that child. 

20Ms McGeeham had counselled the offender not to discuss Ms Wilkinson's murder with anyone other than his solicitor, but he had told her that he was responsible for her death and that he was sorry for Ms Wilkinson and her family. He had asked her what he could do. She had told him that he could not undo anything. In cross-examination, she also explained that the offender had told her he was sorry for the pain he had caused Ms Wilkinson's family and the shame that he had brought to his own family. 

21The evidence showed that the offender was socially gregarious, with a close circle of friends. He had had a number of personal relationships. He had also had a casual sexual relationship with Ms Wilkinson, whom he first met when they were teenagers, but that had ceased some time before her murder. They remained friends. 

22The offender has been in custody since his arrest. He has been in employment while in prison and intends in future to pursue studies to university level. 

23In evidence was a report prepared by clinical and forensic neuropsychologist Dr Pulman, who examined the offender on 11 December 2010 for a neuropsychological assessment. Her report shows that the offender is a young man of average intelligence, not suffering from any ill health, but with a history of head injuries sustained during sport and a number of fighting incidents. He reported having commenced drinking at about 12 or 13 years of age and daily binge drinking to the point of passing out, from age 17. This caused him at one time to attend alcoholics anonymous meetings. He had commenced smoking pot at age 13 and had used ecstasy and amphetamines at weekends, 'a fair bit', since age 18. He had also used mushrooms and LSD, but not heroin or Ice. 

24Dr Pulman's opinion was that the offender was functioning within the average range of intellectual ability; there were no abnormalities in his cognitive functioning; and his verbal memory and processing speed were intact. An assessment of his higher order functioning and executed reasoning abilities indicated that the offender had sound abilities in problem solving, self judgment and self regulation. 

25Dr Westmore's report noted a similar history of drug and alcohol abuse; that the offender had never attended a drug or alcohol rehabilitation facility; and that he was not taking any prescribed medications. He had no history of violent behaviour. The offender explained that he might get angry and loud while affected by alcohol, but that he would not go out of his way to hurt people, or to look for fights. He told Dr Westmore that after the miscarriage, both he and his girlfriend were upset. 

26The offender reported suffering from ongoing nightmares, seeing Ms Wilkinson and thinking that he had blood on his hands. Dr Westmore was of the opinion that: 
""Based on his longitudinal history, the extreme nature of the violence towards the deceased does seem to be unexpected and unpredictable. Feelings of depression and despondency following [the] pregnancy problems and his abuse of drugs and alcohol in the night in question are all likely to have been significant contributors to the offending behaviour. 

He was able to express feelings of regret in relation to his actions and he described symptoms which are likely to be part of a posttraumatic stress disorder arising from the homicide. 

I do not believe that he has a psychiatric defence for the charge of murder. The offending behaviour does appear to be extremely specific occurring in the context of an acute psychosocial stress along with the other aetiological factors identified and his general risk to the community is probably low, particularly if he is able to enter into sobriety in relation to drug and alcohol abuse."" 


The parties' cases 

27The parties did not agree about the seriousness of the offence, or the effect of evidence going to various mitigating matters and their impact on the sentence to be imposed. 

28The Crown's case was that the circumstances of this offence were such that in sentencing, strong elements of denunciation, retribution and punishment were called for and that general deterrence must also play a role. The Crown did not submit that the offender's level of culpability was so extreme, that a sentence of imprisonment for life is to be imposed in accordance with s 61(1) of the Act. There is an onus falling on the Crown to establish that such a sentence is warranted, if it is to be imposed. What the Crown submitted was that on the evidence, this was an offence which fell at the top of, or just above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 

29The case advanced for the offender was that this was an offence which fell at the lower spectrum of the band of offences which lie at the mid-range of objective seriousness. This was the offender's first offence and gave rise to special circumstances. Further, given the evidence, particularly of the offender's subjective case and that going to matters of mitigation, including remorse, rehabilitation, the likelihood of re-offending, behaviour in prison and intentions in relation to further education, when coupled with a utilitarian discount, it would be concluded that he should be extended considerable leniency and sentenced well below the statutory non-parole period. 

The Court's sentencing task 

30The Parliament has required that the sentence imposed on the offender be determined having in mind the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act. Those purposes are: 
""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 


31The sentence imposed must reflect the gravity of this offence, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.) Section 21A of the Act also requires that in determining that sentence, consideration be given to specified aggravating and mitigating facts revealed by the evidence, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence. The sentence must also ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence imposed and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15].) Consideration must also be given to general and specific deterrence in the sentence imposed. 

Matters relevant to the determination of the sentence 

32I have born all of these considerations in mind in arriving at a sentence. I accept the submission that the offender has a strong subjective case. Objectively, however, that this is a very serious offence may not be doubted. This may not be overlooked in the sentence imposed. Ultimately, the sentence imposed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of this offence. 

Aggravating factors 

33The Crown's case was that the aggravating factor necessary to be taken into account was the offender's use of a weapon. That was accepted for the offender. The submission is plainly correct, even though, as Buddin J observed in R v Day [2010] NSWSC 983 at [19], 'most murders are committed by a person using a weapon.' 

34In this case, not only was Ms Wilkinson strangled, which has been described as 'a horrible way to die' (see Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76), she was repeatedly struck with a shovel. Those blows finally caused her death, with the asphyxiation contributing. The offender told police that she was already dead when he struck her. That belief appears to have been wrong, but the evidence certainly suggests that she was, by then, unconscious. She was patently defenceless. Given what the autopsy report reveals as to the brutality with which she was repeatedly struck with the shovel, that the use of this weapon was an aggravating factor may not be doubted. 

35The other aggravating factors specified in the Act do not arise for consideration in this case. 

Mitigating factors 

36That the offence was not planned, was accepted by the Crown. That the offender has no prior criminal record is also a matter to be taken into account. On confession the offender provided certain assistance which must also be taken into account when consideration is given to other mitigating matters which arise for consideration in sentencing. 

37The offender is entitled to a discount for having pleaded guilty to the charge. His plea was first entered in the Local Court and adhered to in this Court. The Crown conceded that in the circumstances, it is within my discretion to grant the offender a discount of at or close to 25% for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, in accordance with the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 

38The purpose of such a utilitarian discount was there explained by the Chief Justice as reflecting the benefits which flow from a guilty plea for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as to witnesses, especially victims, who, as the result of such a plea, are spared having to give evidence and the personal rumination of traumatic events, which is inevitably involved in that process. These benefits must be identified by a trial judge when sentencing, in order to provide an incentive to offenders to enter such a plea, so that such benefits will, in fact, be derived (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [115] to [123]). 

39In this case I am satisfied that given the offender's early plea, he must have a discount of 25% on this account. 

40That the offender has accepted responsibility for his actions in committing this offence, must be accepted. That was evidenced by his confession to investigating police officers; by the assistance which he then provided; by his plea; and by what he later told his mother and Dr Westmore. Whether additional leniency is available on account of the offender's demonstrated remorse for the offence must also be considered. 

41As the Crown accepted, while he initially denied knowledge of Ms Wilkinson's whereabouts and over several days took a number of steps designed to conceal her death and his responsibility for that death, his confession and subsequent co-operation with the police reflected that remorse over what he had done, while initially absent, came to grow. 

42The trigger for the confession was plainly the police pursuing its investigation and taking steps to search one of his cars. His father's presence at that point led to his consent to the car he was driving on the night he murdered Ms Wilkinson being investigated; his confession; and the recovery of Ms Wilkinson's body. This must also all be taken into account. 

43While there was not in this case sworn evidence of remorse given by the offender, which was capable of being tested, I am satisfied that the evidence of the offender's conduct when he confessed, as well as what he later told his mother and Dr Westmore, shows that he has not only accepted responsibility for his actions, he has also acknowledged the injury which he has caused Ms Wilkinson and her family (see Alvares v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33). That remorse must also be taken into account and given proper weight in the sentencing process. 

44There is also evidence, including Dr Westmore's opinion, which supports the view that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly having regard to his age, his conduct while in custody, his existing qualifications and intentions to purse further studies and the ongoing support which he has from his family. That evidence must, however, be considered together with the evidence that he has not taken effective steps to deal with what appears to be a serious, longstanding problem with drugs and alcohol. 

45As I said, the evidence shows that the offender has a strong subjective case. There is evidence that he was previously of good character. However, the evidence of his significant long term use of illicit drugs must also be taken into account. That reduces the weight which may be given to the evidence of good character (see Aoun v R [2007] NSWCCA 292 at [23]). 

46That the offender is unlikely to reoffend, is in my view not a conclusion which may readily be reached. I note Dr Westmore's opinion that the offender's risk to the community is probably low. Nevertheless, given the evidence as to the circumstances in which he came to murder Ms Wilkinson and dispose of her body; the extreme nature of his violence, which Dr Westmore considered to be unexpected and unpredictable; and the absence of any evidence from the offender, that he is not likely to re-offend in future is, in my view, not a matter about which it is possible to be confident. 

47It is also necessary to consider the evidence that the offender had consumed both cannabis and alcohol before he committed the offence. The offender gave no evidence himself about what he consumed, but there is various evidence as to how much alcohol he had consumed and conflicting evidence as to how it affected him. The offender told Dr Westmore that he had been heavily intoxicated and that he would not have lost control in the same way, if he had not used alcohol and drugs that night. 

48On his account to Dr Westmore and Dr Pulman, consuming alcohol and drugs to excess was not unusual, to the contrary, it was habitual. There was daily alcohol intake, as well as regular binge drinking and drug taking on weekends. By way of contrast, his mother's evidence was that she had seen the offender intoxicated, but he was careful not to drive when affected by alcohol and that his consumption of alcohol had never created any problems for his work attendance or performance. She was not aware of his drug consumption. That evidence was consistent with his driving record. 

49On his account to Dr Pulman, in the past the offender had engaged in a number of fights, but he had no other history of violence, particularly no history of drug or alcohol fuelled violence towards his friends or family. Despite his account of regular binge drinking and substance abuse, the offender had no driving offences or any other criminal record. It thus appears that the offender had considerable ability to control his conduct, even when drinking to excess and taking illicit drugs. 

50The offender gave conflicting accounts as to how much he had drunk and how he was affected, when he killed Ms Wilkinson. There was also other evidence which shed light on these matters, which must be considered. 

51The offender told Dr Westmore that he commenced drinking when he finished work at 3.15pm. There is evidence that he left the pub at 10.04pm and went home by taxi. From exchanges of text messages between the offender and Ms Wilkinson, it seems that they must have met after the last text which Ms Wilkinson sent him at 10.38pm. He told Dr Westmore that he killed Ms Wilkinson between 10.30pm and 11.00pm. 

52An account of the amount of alcohol the offender had consumed was given to police by a friend in 2009. He said that they had drunk eight beers and then the offender had drunk double scotch on ice and had taken some mixed drinks away with him from the pub. The offender told Dr Westmore in December 2010 that he had been an alcoholic for years, he had drunk a large bottle of Jack Daniels that night, as well as twelve schooners and had smoked a $20 packet of cannabis; he had been drinking pretty heavily all week and that night he 'really wrote himself off'. 

53On 22 September 2009, the offender told police in a recorded interview that he had 'just had a few' that night; on 24 September, before he confessed, he told his father that he could not remember a period of two hours on the night of the murder; later he told police that he was 'really pissed' and that he 'can't really remember much about Friday night'. When he confessed later that day, he made no reference to his alcohol consumption. 

54It is apparent from his confession and subsequent actions in assisting the police, that whatever his level of intoxication was that night, he had a memory of what he had done to Ms Wilkinson. 

55Another friend who spoke to the offender at about 10.30pm on the night he killed Ms Wilkinson, later described him to police as being 'pretty pissed'. The taxi driver told the police that when he drove the offender at about 10.00pm, that he did not appear intoxicated. When his father saw him at their home at 1.30am, he described him as 'very out of sorts'. The offender told his father the next day, when asked why he was so weird the previous night, that he fell asleep in his ute and when he woke up he realised 'I'd shit myself'. That was untrue. The offender had gone home, to clean up and to hide the clothes he and Ms Wilkinson had been wearing. 

56The offender arrived at his girlfriend's house at about 2.00am. His girlfriend told police that she had often seen him drunk, but would not have described him as drunk when he came home that night and later, that she thought he was 'completely sober'. 

57As Hidden J observed in R v Shepherd [2007] NSWSC 1416 at [59] 'it is the experience of this Court, that, not infrequently, elaborate steps are taken to cover up a killing which was spontaneous.' The evidence of the extensive steps taken by the offender to conceal Ms Wilkinson's murder, were consistent with his girlfriend's and father's descriptions of his state. That he would have been capable of doing all that he did that night, if heavily intoxicated and drug affected as he later told Dr Westmore he was, seems most unlikely. 

58Not only did he drive, both before and after Ms Wilkinson's murder, contrary to his usual habit when drinking to excess, he undressed Ms Wilkinson's body; he buried her body at night on the bank of a lagoon some distance from his home; he concealed the burial site in such a way that even when he later took the police to the site, it was not apparent that the ground had been disturbed; he went home and hid Ms Wilkinson's clothes and his own; and he cleaned himself sufficiently, so that when he encountered his father, what he had done was not obvious. He then showered and drove to his girlfriend's house. He was able to conceive and act on a plan to conceal his knowledge of Ms Wilkinson's death and the whereabouts of her body, by disposing of her mobile phone and sending a text to her phone and attempting to ring her, after her death. That night he was also able to successfully interact with both his father and his girlfriend, without revealing to them that he was either heavily intoxicated or drug affected, or what he had done to Ms Wilkinson. He retained a memory of what he had done and was able to effectively conceal his actions that night and during the following days. 

59In all, the offender was able to maintain remarkable control over his faculties and his conduct, given the state he told Dr Westmore he was in, when he murdered Ms Wilkinson. The offender also told Dr Westmore that he freaked out and panicked, after he realised he had killed Ms Wilkinson and that was when he tried to get rid of her. While what he then did was consistent with that account, it was not consistent with the level of intoxication the offender described to Dr Westmore. 

60Also to be considered is what the offender told the police in September 2009 when he confessed. Then he said that strangling Ms Wilkinson had started out as 'a joke', but he could not stop and that he hit her with the shovel, after he thought that she was dead. This account does not appear to be consistent with what he later told Dr Westmore in 2010, namely that he had strangled Ms Wilkinson in an act of blind rage, in response to what she had said about the miscarriage a week earlier, that behaviour being the result of his alcohol and drug consumption. Because the offender gave no evidence, the two accounts remain untested. 

61Alcohol and drug consumption of itself cannot mitigate the seriousness of an offence, but it may explain the context in which it occurred (see R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381). In XY v R [2007] NSWCCA 72 at [29] it was observed that '[a] person's self control may be severely diminished by excessive alcohol although a memory of the event remains.' In R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 467, Hunt CJ at CL explained that in some circumstances 'intoxication will mitigate the offence because the offender has by reason of that intoxication acted out of character.' 

62It must be accepted that the evidence established that the offender killing Ms Wilkinson was entirely out of character. It may also be accepted that the alcohol and drugs which he had consumed that night, affected his judgment. Of itself, however, the offender's drug and alcohol consumption, whatever it might have been, cannot mitigate the seriousness of this offence. 

63It is also necessary to deal with the question of provocation. The offender bears the burden of proof, on the balance of probabilities. The Crown's case was that the evidence could not satisfy the Court that Ms Wilkinson provoked the offender. The offender's case was that it would be accepted that provocation was established, as the result of a combination of the offender's increased sensitivity to Ms Wilkinson's remarks, given his earlier loss of a child and the recent loss as the result of the miscarriage; the nature of the comments themselves; and the effects of alcohol and cannabis on his judgment. 

64On the evidence I am not persuaded that provocation was established. 

65I have already dealt with the question of the alcohol and drugs which the offender had consumed and their effects. 

66As I have already noted, the offender has given two quite different accounts of how he came to murder Ms Wilkinson. It was only when he spoke to Dr Westmore, that he gave any account of remarks made by Ms Wilkinson, which provoked his 'blind rage', causing him to strangle her. His earlier account was that the strangling began as a joke. Because the offender gave no evidence, his differing accounts were not tested. 

67The offender also told Dr Westmore that Ms Wilkinson was a nice girl, who he first met when she was 15 or 16 and that their sexual relationship began when she was 18. It later ended mutually when he had another girlfriend and Ms Wilkinson then entered a relationship with one of his friends. They had no ongoing sexual relationship. She had rung him that night and asked him if he wanted a drink, he had picked her up and they had driven around for a bit and had then pulled over at the river and talked. 

68It was only in this account which he gave to Dr Westmore, that the offender mentioned discussing the miscarriage and Ms Wilkinson saying to him that it was a good thing that the baby had died and a good thing that it had happened. In my assessment, if Ms Wilkinson made such remarks, even accepting that the offender was upset by the miscarriage and the earlier loss of another baby, the offender's reaction was grossly disproportionate, notwithstanding the drugs and alcohol which he had consumed. 

69How Ms Wilkinson came to know about the miscarriage is not known. Presumably it was the offender who told Ms Wilkinson of the recent miscarriage. On the evidence, the offender's girlfriend and Ms Wilkinson were not close. There is no suggestion that anyone else knew of the miscarriage, other than the treating doctor. The offender's mother did not know of the miscarriage, or that the offender was upset as a result, even though they had dinner together a few days later. The offender did not drink that night, while they were together and they discussed only normal, everyday things. Neither the offender or his girlfriend told her of the miscarriage, or that the offender was upset. The offender's mother was also not aware of the birth and death of the child of his earlier relationship, or that it was something which had ever troubled him. 

70There is little else that is known about the interaction between the offender and Ms Wilkinson that night. That Ms Wilkinson was aware that the offender was not only distressed about the miscarriage, but also about the death of his other prematurely born baby some years earlier, is not apparent. Even assuming that she was aware of this and that she then made what was an insensitive, or even a very cruel remark about the miscarriage, that the offender's response was 'so far out of any reasonable proportion to the behaviour of the victim' that there was no mitigation arising, must in my view be accepted (see R v Mendez [2002] NSWCCA 415 at [16].) 

71Even accepting that his judgment was adversely affected by what he had consumed, the untested, contradictory and incomplete accounts of what caused the offender to strangle Ms Wilkinson and then to beat her to death with a shovel cannot, in my assessment, 'constitute evidence of provocation such as to amount to mitigation', (see Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58 at [26]). 

72It follows that the offender must be sentenced on the basis that his offence was not premeditated and that it was out of character. I can, however, make no positive finding in his favour as to what caused him to kill Ms Wilkinson, or that the killing was provoked by Ms Wilkinson. The evidence does not permit any firm finding as to what it was that triggered his attack, other than that it was spontaneous. 

Standard non-parole period 

73As I have said, the offence of murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, attracts the operation of s 54A of the Act, which provides for a standard non-parole period of 20 years for a mid-range offence of murder. This standard non-parole period does not apply after a plea, but it must still be kept in mind as 'a reference point, or benchmark' in sentencing, as must the maximum penalty (see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [122]). 

74In considering where in the range this offence falls, I have paid regard to the principles discussed in R v Way ; R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575; MLP v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93; R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110; Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282; and R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43. For the offender it was urged that particular regard would be paid to what Kirby J observed in MLP v The Queen at [33]. 

75In Nguyen v The Queen; ATCN v The Queen; Nguyen v The Queen; Huynh v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 363; (2007) 180 A Crim R 267 at [143], it was observed that '[a]n intention to kill and premeditation are usual elements in a murder of mid range objective seriousness'. On the evidence that there was an intention to kill in this case was established, but premeditation was not. 

76In Versluys v R it was observed at [34] that: 
""It may be accepted that a murder which is not premeditated would usually be less serious than one which involves planning. However murder is a crime which can be committed under a very wide range of circumstances and the absence of premeditation does not dictate a finding that the objective seriousness of the particular offence falls below the mid range."" 

77While this murder was not premeditated, in determining the objective seriousness of this offence proper account must be taken of all the evidence as to the circumstances of the offence, including how Ms Wilkinson's death was caused. That this was a most brutal killing may not be overlooked in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and the range within which it falls. 

78Having weighed the various aggravating and mitigating matters which must be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, I am satisfied that the evidence does not permit a conclusion that this offence fell below the mid-range of seriousness, even though it was not premeditated. I have concluded that this offence falls at just above the mid-range of such offences. 

79In determining sentence, consideration must be given to that conclusion, as well as to the offender's subjective case and the mitigating matters which are relevant to sentence. They include my conclusion that the offender is entitled to a 25% utilitarian discount; his remorse and prospects of rehabilitation; and his confession and co-operation with the authorities. 

80I am not of the view that there should be a finding of special circumstances warranting a reduction in the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period, because this is the offender's first time in custody. I have taken his lack of prior record into account in determining the sentence and am of the view that the usual statutory ratio will provide an appropriate period of supervision on parole. In my view, any lesser period of imprisonment would not be sufficient to reflect necessary considerations of deterrence and retribution. 

Comparable cases 

81For the offender it was submitted that some, albeit limited guidance would be provided by statistics available from the Judicial Commission, which showed only nine cases with comparable characteristics to those in this case. The result was a mid-range non-parole period of 15 years. 

82Attention was also drawn to what were submitted to be comparable offences considered in decisions such as R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951; R v Kwon (2010) NSWSC 671; R v D ay; R v Shepherd and Regina v Prior [2002] NSWSC 56 (where no standard non-parole period applied). It was submitted that they involved comparable factual circumstances, which had been assessed as falling below the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

83These decisions were of some assistance to what I have to determine, but each dealt with differing circumstances to those which arise for consideration in this case. The sentencing discretion which I must exercise in this case, must have reference to the evidence which has here been led on sentence. 

Custody 

84I do accept that account must also be taken of the fact that the offender has been in continuous custody since 24 September 2009. It is appropriate to commence the sentence imposed on the offender from that date. 

The victim impact statement 

85With assistance, Ms Wilkinson's mother read a victim impact statement which described her outrage and distress over the untimely loss of her daughter. What she explained about the impact of her daughter's death on her and her family was heartrending. The despair, grief and betrayal which she described is entirely understandable, as are the difficulties which the legal process itself have given rise to, about which she also spoke. 

86That process and the delays involved are not always easy to understand, but it may be observed that it is a system which our society has developed, in an endeavour to ensure that justice is achieved, but not at the risk of inflicting injustice on top of terrible tragedy. There are inevitably tensions in any system which human beings devise and have to implement, when important competing considerations must be balanced. That the perhaps imperfect operation of this system is the cause of additional pain for Mrs Wilkinson and her family, is very much to be regretted. 

87It is not possible for me to attempt to summarise what Mrs Wilkinson said in her statement, let alone to convey the emotion with which her words were delivered in this courtroom. Any member of the community who heard what she described, would feel the utmost sympathy for her plight. The sentence which will be imposed on the offender, indeed any sentence, cannot make good the loss which has been suffered. 

88Ms Wilkinson's family, her friends and the members of the small community in which she and the offender lived, all have to continue living with the consequences of what has occurred. That will not be easy, but has to be faced. For myself, I extend my very deepest sympathies to Ms Wilkinson's family and friends for their terrible loss. 

89Finally, I record that in making these remarks I have adhered to the well settled approach which a sentencing judge must adopt, when receiving victim impact statements. In R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274, five members of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the approach established in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Cim R 76, which has since been followed. They concluded that approach must be adhered to. That means that an unsworn, untested victim impact statement may not be taken into account in sentencing the offender, for reasons which were explained at length by Hunt CJ at CL in 1997 and which I understand were explained to Mrs Wilkinson, before she made her statement. I will not deal with them further now. 

Sentence 

90I note that but for the utilitarian value of the offender's plea, I would have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment of 29 years. With discount, the sentence is 21 years and 9 months. I will fix a non-parole period of 16 years, 3 months and 23 days. 

91Ryan Christopher Williams I convict you of the murder of Shana Joy Wilkinson. 

92You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years, 3 months and 23 days, commencing on 24 September 2009 and expiring on 15 January 2026. I set a balance of term of 5 years, 5 months and 8 days, which is to commence on 16 January 2026 and to expire on 23 June 2031. You will be eligible for release on parole on 16 January 2026.

2757186,Robert John Downing v WIN Television (NSW) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 563,"Judgment 

Background 

1On 21 October 2010 I gave judgment in this matter ( Downing v WIN Television (NSW) Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 1132) in which I concluded that the defendants were trespassers on the plaintiff's land and were liable to pay the plaintiff damages in respect of that trespass. This judgment concerns the assessment of those damages. 

2The factual background to the case is set out in my earlier judgment. It is not necessary to repeat it here. I should, however, provide a brief summary so far as it is relevant to the question of damages. 

3The first defendant, WIN, is a regional television broadcaster. In early 1989, it entered into an agreement with the plaintiff's father, Mr Downing Snr, to erect a television tower and associated equipment shed and fence on Mr Downing Snr's property located near Goulburn. The tower that was eventually erected was approximately 42 metres high and the site occupied by WIN covered an area of approximately 150 square metres. Over time, the shed was replaced with a larger building and WIN sublicensed space on its tower and in the adjacent building to other telecommunications operators, including the second defendant, Prime Television, and the third defendant, the State of New South Wales. Prime Television was another regional television broadcaster. The State of New South Wales used the facilities in connection with the Government Radio Network ( GRN ). On the findings I made, the arrangements by which WIN sublicensed space on its tower and in its building to others was a breach of the agreement WIN had with Mr Downing Snr. 

4Mr Downing Snr died in 1995 and his property at Goulburn ultimately passed to the plaintiff, Mr Downing. Mr Downing requested WIN to leave the property on 14 December 1998 and to remove the television tower, building and fence. WIN did not do so. As a consequence, I held that WIN, Prime Television and the State were trespassers from the end of June 1999. 

5There were protracted negotiations between Mr Downing and WIN in relation to the terms on which WIN and its sub-licensees could remain on the property. However, those negotiations did not result in an agreement. During the course of the negotiations, Mr Downing changed his position and maintained that WIN was not entitled to remove the tower or building. In the meantime, WIN looked for alternative sites. It ultimately reached an agreement to lease a portion of land on the adjacent property, approximately 200 metres from the existing site. That property was owned by Mrs Fitch and, following her death, Mr Koper, who apparently was Mrs Fitch's husband. The lease between WIN and Mrs Fitch commenced on 1 March 2003. It is for a period of 10 years with an option exercisable by WIN for a further 10 years. The rent was originally $5,000 payable annually in advance. The lease provided that the rent would increase annually in accordance with increases in the consumer price index. WIN also agreed to pay Mrs Fitch 20 percent of any amount earned by WIN from sublicensing space on the tower and in the associated building. 

6WIN constructed a new tower on Mrs Fitch's property in late 2004. 

7On 3 March 2005, WIN sought an easement from Mr Downing to obtain electricity for its installation on Mrs Fitch's property. However, the parties were unable to reach agreement on the terms of the easement. As a result, WIN negotiated an easement with Mrs Fitch for which it agreed to pay $40,000. At the same time, WIN and Mrs Fitch agreed to execute a variation of lease. Under the terms of that variation, the annual rent from 1 March 2006 was increased to $14,500 per annum. That rent was still subject to annual CPI increases. In addition, Mrs Fitch was still entitled to receive 20 percent of any amounts earned by WIN from sublicensing space on the tower or in the associated building. The reasons for the increase in rent are not explained in the evidence. 

8It is not clear when WIN ceased to transmit signals using the transmission tower on Mr Downing's land. The evidence before me at the time of the hearing in relation to liability suggested that it was in March 2007. However, according to a GRN circular tendered by the plaintiff during the course of the current hearing, the GRN equipment was moved on 29 April 2008. For the purposes of assessing damages, it is reasonable to conclude on the basis of that evidence that WIN ceased to use the tower on Mr Downing's land at the end of April 2008. The tower itself, however, was not removed until March 2011, following my earlier judgment in which I concluded that the tower was not a fixture and that WIN was entitled to remove it. Up until that time, WIN maintained a fence around the site and kept the gate through which access was obtained locked. It visited the site periodically to check that it was secure. 

9The parties accept that the measure of damages for trespass is the reasonable or market rental value of the land during the time of the defendants' occupancy: Lamru Pty Ltd v Kation Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 432 at 439 per Cohen J; Currawinya Pty Ltd v Adams (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 1 at [98] per Slattery J. The parties also agree that, insofar as Mr Downing claims damages for the period prior to 1 February 2001, that claim is statute barred. 

10In support of his claim for damages, Mr Downing led evidence from Mr Paris, an expert valuer. It is not necessary to describe in detail the approach taken by Mr Paris. It is sufficient to observe that it was flawed in two main respects. First, Mr Paris was asked to express separate opinions on the value of the land occupied by WIN, Prime Television and the State for the transmission of microwave signals and of broadcast television signals. Mr Paris accepted in cross-examination that there was no reason to draw that distinction and that he only did so because it was a distinction that his instructions required him to draw. Secondly, Mr Paris used a number of comparables that differed very substantially from WIN's use of Mr Downing's land. For example, two comparables relied on by Mr Paris were leases that WIN had entered into with the Minister for the Environment for sites at Mount Nardi and Mount Moombil. The site at Mt Nardi occupied 1,100 square metres and the tower erected on it was in excess of 90 metres. The site at Mount Moombil occupied 2,100 square metres and the tower erected on it was approximately 80 metres. On the other hand, Mr Paris appears to have placed little weight on the lease entered into between WIN and Mrs Fitch. 

11In closing submissions, Mr Elliott, who appeared for Mr Downing, all but abandoned the conclusions reached by Mr Paris and conceded that the best evidence of the fair value of the site occupied by WIN on Mr Downing's land was the amount WIN agreed to pay Mrs Fitch. In my opinion, Mr Elliott was right to make that concession. The land leased by WIN from Mrs Fitch was only 200 metres from the land occupied by WIN on Mr Downing's property. The area occupied by WIN was roughly the same size and the tower erected by it roughly the same height. The amount paid by WIN to Mrs Fitch was for a lease. Similarly, there is no doubt that WIN enjoyed exclusive possession of the area it occupied on Mr Downing's property. There is no question that WIN and Mrs Fitch were at arm's length. In those circumstances, the amount WIN agreed to pay Mrs Fitch is a very good guide to the market value of the land on which WIN had trespassed. 

12As a result, the issues between the parties were: 

(a)Whether it was appropriate to use as a comparable the rent payable by WIN under the initial lease from Mrs Fitch (that is, $5,000 with CPI increases) or the varied lease (that is, $14,500 with CPI increases); 

(b)Whether damages should be payable until WIN stopped using the site to transmit television and microwave signals (that is, until the end of April 2008) or whether they should be payable until WIN removed its tower (that is, until the end of March 2011); 

(c)Whether damages should include a proportion of the fees that sub-licensees paid to WIN; 

(d)What interest WIN should pay; 

(e)How damages against Prime Television and the State should be assessed. 

Which rent should be used in assessing damages? 

13In my opinion, it is appropriate to use the rent payable under the variation of lease. Although WIN had erected a tower on Mrs Fitch's land before the variation was agreed to, it did not use that tower until 2008. The evidence suggests that it was not in a position to do so before that time because it had not resolved the issue of a power supply. WIN led no evidence to explain why it agreed to the variation. In those circumstances, I think it is reasonable to infer that the variation was required to permit WIN to do something which was necessary to enable it to operate its tower in the way it had done previously on Mr Downing's land. It is difficult to understand why WIN would have agreed to pay additional rent otherwise. 

14Mr Stack, who appeared for WIN, attempted to resist the conclusion of the previous paragraph on two grounds. First, he pointed to what he said were comparable leases where the rent payable was commensurate with the rent payable under the initial lease. Secondly, he said that the onus was on Mr Downing to prove his loss, and consequently it was for him to establish that the initial rent was not an appropriate comparable. As a fall back position, Mr Stack submitted that damages should only be assessed on the basis of the varied rent from the time that that rent took effect. 

15I do not accept Mr Stack's submissions. WIN did not start using the tower on Mrs Fitch's land for transmitting television and microwave signals until after it had agreed to pay the varied rent. In the absence of some other explanation, the rent that WIN was paying at that time is the best evidence of the value of the land for that use. If WIN had agreed to pay the varied rent for some other reason, then that was a matter peculiarly within WIN's knowledge. WIN must have appreciated that the rent payable under the lease from Mrs Fitch would be used as a comparable. Indeed, WIN accepts that it is the best comparable. In those circumstances, I think that it was for WIN to call evidence to rebut the inference that the additional rent was paid for the use of the land to transmit television and microwave signals. For the reasons I have given, the rent payable by WIN under the lease with Mrs Fitch was the best comparable. In addition, for reasons which I will explain, I do not propose to award interest to Mr Downing on the rent payable to him for the period before 1 March 2006. Taking those matters into account, I do not think the rent payable to Mrs Fitch should be discounted as the measure of Mr Downing's loss because WIN was able to negotiate lower rents for other sites. 

Until when should damages be payable? 

16In my opinion, WIN should pay damages based on the lease from Mrs Fitch until the end of April 2008. I accept Mr Elliott's submission that WIN continued to be a trespasser past that time because its tower remained on Mr Downing's property, WIN continued to exclude Mr Downing from the site occupied by it (because the site was fenced and the gate permitting access was locked) and WIN continued to arrange for periodic inspections of the site. However, in my opinion, Mr Downing is only entitled to nominal damages in respect of those trespasses. WIN received no benefit from the site past the end of April 2008. From that time, Mr Downing asserted an entitlement to retain the tower on his property. Given that, he can hardly complain that WIN left it there until the issue was resolved by the court. It was in Mr Downing's interest as much as WIN's that the site remained secure, so that neither of them was exposed to the risk of being sued in the event that someone obtained access to the tower and was injured climbing it. Similarly, it was in the interests of both of them that the site be inspected from time to time to ensure that that state of affairs continued. Mr Downing gave no reason for why he needed access to the site. The site was only approximately 150 square metres in size and was not suitable for use for any other purpose. 

17It follows that Mr Downing is entitled to substantial damages for trespass for the period 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. The assessment of those damages necessarily involve a judgment which carries with it a degree of imprecision. Accepting that, an award of damages in respect of that period should be seen as including a nominal amount for the period after 30 April 2008. 

Should the damages include a proportion of sub-licensing fees paid to WIN? 

18In my opinion, they should. 

19Mr Paris gave evidence that, where property was leased to enable the erection of a telecommunications tower and the lessee had a right to sub-license space on the tower and in any associated building, it was usual for the lessee to agree to pay to the lessor a proportion of the sublicensing fees ranging from zero to 50 percent. Certainly, there was evidence of cases where the lessee was entitled to sub-license space but was not obliged to pay any proportion of the sub-licensing fees to the lessor. On the other hand, in the negotiations between WIN and Mr Downing, WIN offered to pay Mr Downing 50 percent of the sub-licensing fees received by it. Under the lease from Ms Fitch, WIN is obliged to pay 20 percent of the sublicensing fees it receives. 

20In my opinion, there is a relationship between the rent payable under a lease and the right of a lessor to be paid a proportion of sub-licensing fees. Other things being equal, the higher the proportion of sub-licensing fees payable to the lessor, the lower the rent that is likely to be payable by the lessee. What combination particular lessors and lessees will choose will depend partly on the anticipated number of sub-licensees and on the willingness of the lessor to take the risk that that number, and the fees that the sub-licensees pay, will turn out to be greater or smaller than anticipated. The important point, though, is that there is a connection between the rent which a lessee agrees to pay and the proportion of sub-licensing fees the lessee agrees to pay which strongly suggests that, absent some good reason, if the lease from Mrs Fitch is the best comparable for the rent that should be paid, it is also the best comparable for the proportion of sub-licensing fees that should be paid. Neither party pointed to a good reason for adopting a different approach. Consequently, Mr Downing should be entitled to 20 percent of the sub-licensing fees received by WIN. 

21Two other issues arise in relation to sub-licensing fees. First, Mr Downing claims fees paid not just by Prime Television and the State but a number of other sub-licensees he has identified. Although Mr Stack took objection to that approach, in my opinion there is no reason why Mr Downing should not be able to claim the benefit of all licence fees paid to WIN. 

22Second, the evidence in relation to the payment of fees is far from complete. Mr Elliott says that, in those circumstances, I should adopt the approach that has its genesis in the decision of Armory v Delamirie (1722) 1 Stra 505; 93 ER 664 and assess the compensation payable ""in a robust manner, relying on the presumption against wrongdoers, the onus of proof, and resolving doubtful questions against the party ""whose actions have made an accurate determination so problematic"""": Houghton & Anor v Immer (No. 155) Pty Ltd and Anor (1997) 44 NSWLR 46 at 59 per Handley JA (with whom Mason P and Beazley JA agreed), quoting Hodgson J in LJP Investments Pty Ltd v Howard Chia Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) (1990) 24 NSWLR 499 at 508. However, in my view that principle does not have any particular application in this case. Mr Downing bears the onus of proof in relation to the damages he claims. The determination of the sub-licensing fees is difficult in this case because WIN's records are incomplete, no doubt in part because of the time that has passed since the relevant events. But I do not think that WIN bears any particular responsibility for that state of affairs. There have been lengthy delays in bringing the dispute to a head, but those delays are the result of the conduct of both parties. There is sufficient material to draw reasonable inferences about what sub-licensing fees were paid. There is no basis for drawing conclusions beyond those inferences. The calculation of the relevant amounts is arithmetically complicated. In those circumstances, it would have been desirable for Mr Downing to lead accounting evidence concerning the calculations. Given that he has not, I think that it is appropriate for me to indicate the approach that should be applied and invite the parties to agree on short minutes of order that give effect to that approach and to hear further argument if they cannot agree. 

23There is evidence that WIN sub-licensed space to 5 sub-licensees: the State, Prime Television, Australian Capital Television, Vodafone and Hutchison Telecommunications. 

24By an agreement dated 22 November 1995 between WIN and the Minister for Public Works, WIN agreed to sub-license space on the tower and in its building to the State and to give access to the State and its nominated agent, Telstra, to the site. Although the agreement was entered into in 1995, the commencement date was 1 August 1994. The sub-licence was for a period of 5 years from the date it was signed and the Minister was granted three 5 year options, all of which were exercised. The initial fee payable under the sub-licence was $6,321. That fee is subject to annual adjustments in accordance with increases in the CPI and was said to be payable annually in advance. However, the evidence suggests that payments were made quarterly. There is no reason why Mr Downing should not recover 20 percent of the fees payable under the agreement from 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. 

25There are in evidence invoices showing the amounts paid by the State for the whole period from February 2001 to October 2007, apart from the period May to July 2007. WIN should pay Mr Downing 20 percent of the amounts shown on those invoices. I think that it is reasonable to assume that the fee payable for the period May to July 2007 was the same as the fee payable for February to April 2007 (that is, $2,008). I also think that it is reasonable to assume that the State continued to pay WIN up until the time WIN moved to Mrs Fitch's land at the end of April 2008 and that it continued to pay at the same rate as it paid for the period August to October 2007 (that is, $2,008 per quarter). WIN should therefore also pay 20 percent of those amounts. 

26WIN entered into two agreements with Prime Television. The first was a deed entered into on 1 June 1993 and related to various television transmitting equipment. The initial term of the deed was 15 years. However, cl 37.1 provided that the deed was deemed to be renewed for a further period of 15 years unless Prime Television gave written notice that it did not require a further licence or it failed to comply with its obligations under the deed. There is no evidence that either of those conditions for expiry of the deed were satisfied. The initial fee for use was $4,533. That fee was subject to adjustment in the event that shared facilities were replaced and was subject to increases in proportion to increases in the CPI. The fees for each year were payable in advance by two equal instalments on 1 January and 30 June of each year. The evidence in relation to payment of the fee is limited. In the absence of any other evidence, I think that it can be inferred that the parties complied with their contractual obligations. In addition, there are documents showing that WIN invoiced Prime Television ""for various sites"" during the period July 2001 and June 2003. There are also documents that show that WIN invoiced Prime Television $2,486.00 for the half years commencing on 1 July 2004, 1 January 2005 and 1 July 2005 and a vendor profile report showing other payments by Prime Television to WIN. Finally, there is an internal WIN email dated 19 March 2007 from Mr Battaglia to Ms Brown in which Mr Battaglia sets out a breakdown of fees charged to various licensees including Prime Television. That email says that Prime Television was paying WIN $4,973 per annum under the deed at that time. In my opinion, it can be inferred from this evidence that Prime Television paid WIN amounts under the deed during the period 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. However, it is less clear how much it paid. I do not think it is possible to determine that amount by taking the starting amount set out in the deed and increasing that amount annually by reference to the increase in the CPI since that is clearly not what happened. The position appears to be that, at least during the period 1 July 2004 to March 2007, Prime Television was paying $4,973 (or $4,972) per annum. That appears to be less than the amount that would have been payable if the original figure in the deed had been increased in proportion to increases in the CPI. In those circumstances, I think Mr Downing should be entitled to 20 percent of $4,973 per annum from 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. 

27The second agreement between WIN and Prime Television was entered into on 22 June 1999, although the commencement date is expressed to be 1 July 1994. The agreement in evidence is incomplete. It appears to relate to a microwave antenna. The agreement was for a term of 10 years from its commencement with an option for 10 years. The initial licence fee was $7,155 per annum, which comprised $2,550 for the tower, $850 for the building, $2,040 for the microwave antenna and feeders and $1,715 for diesel (presumably to run the power generator). Again, evidence of payments under the agreement is scant. However, there are documents showing the payment of $7,155 on 31 January 2006. In addition, the email dated 19 March 2007 from Mr Battaglia to Ms Brown refers to that amount as being the annual licence fee. I think that it can be inferred from these documents that the option to renew was exercised and WIN received annual fees payable on 31 January of each year during the period 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. Mr Downing should be entitled to 20 percent of those amounts. Those amounts include amounts for diesel. There is a question whether that amount should be excluded when calculating the amount to which Mr Downing is entitled on the basis that that payment does not relate to Mr Downing's property. The point was not argued before me. In those circumstances, I do not think that I should make that adjustment. WIN is entitled to keep 80 percent of the total amount paid to it. I think it is reasonable to proceed on the basis that that 80 percent permits WIN to recover the costs it incurs in providing goods and services under the sub-licence. It follows that Mr Downing should receive 20 percent of $7,155 in respect of each year from 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. 

28The third sub-licence granted by WIN was to Australian Capital Television, which is also a regional television broadcaster. That sub-licence was entered into on 2 July 1998. The commencement date is expressed to be 20 January 1996 and the expiration date to be 19 January 2006, although cl 16 provides for a holding over period. Clause 15 provides for an option to renew. However, there is no evidence that that option was exercised. The licence covers a number of sites. The original licence fee for Mr Downing's site is expressed to be $7,700 per annum payable half yearly in advance. That fee was expressed to be subject to increases in proportion to increases in the CPI. The only evidence of what Australian Capital Television paid WIN is the email dated 19 March 2007 from Mr Battaglia to Ms Brown, which states that the payment was $7,700 per annum. There is also evidence that WIN issued debit notes for the full amount due under the agreement covering the period July 2001 to June 2003. I think that it can be inferred from the email that the sub-licence did not expire on 19 January 2006. In the absence of any other evidence, I think that it should be inferred that Australian Capital Television paid WIN $7,700 per annum half yearly in advance (that is, on 1 July and 1 January of each year) for the period 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. Mr Downing should be entitled to 20 percent of those amounts. 

29The fourth sub-licence was to Vodafone. That sub-licence was entered into on 24 August 1994 and was expressed to commence on 1 August 1994. It was for a term of 10 years with a holding over period. Clause 7.1 granted Vodafone an option to extend the licence for a further period of 10 years. However, there is no evidence that the option was exercised. The initial licence fee was $3,700 in the first year and $4,200 in the second. In subsequent years, the fee was to increase in proportion to increases in the CPI. The fee was to be paid annually in advance. The position in relation to this sub-licence is similar to the position in relation to the sub-licence to Australian Capital Television. The only real evidence of actual payment is the email dated 19 March 2007 from Mr Battaglia to Ms Brown which states that the licence fee payable by Vodafone at that time was $5,617.70. Again, I think that it can be inferred from that document that the sub-licence did not expire on 1 August 2004 but continued under the holding over provision. I also think that it can be inferred that the fee increased in proportion to increases in the CPI. It follows that Mr Downing is entitled to 20 of the fee payable by Vodafone in accordance with the agreement as increased by increases in the CPI for the period from 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. 

30The last sub-licence was to Hutchison Telecommunications. That sub-licence was entered into on 4 November 1998 but was expressed to have commenced on 6 February 1995 and to expire on 5 February 2010. The annual licence fee was $2,000 payable quarterly in advance. It was subject to adjustments in accordance with increases in the CPI. Again, the only real evidence of actual payment is the email dated 19 March 2007 from Mr Battaglia to Ms Brown, which states that the licence fee payable by Hutchison Telecommunications at that time was $2,543.20. Again, in my opinion, it follows that Mr Downing is entitled to 20 percent of the fee payable by Hutchison Telecommunications under the agreement as increased by increases in the CPI for the period from 1 February 2001 to 30 April 2008. 

To what interest is Mr Downing entitled? 

31Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 confers a broad discretion on the court to award interest. The purpose of interest is to ensure that a successful plaintiff who obtains a money judgment is properly compensated for the loss it has suffered. Consequently, a successful plaintiff is generally entitled to an award of interest: Ruby v Marsh [1975] HCA 32; (1975) 132 CLR 642 at 644; Falkner v Bourke (1990) 19 NSWLR 574 at 576. 

32In the case of the rent payable by WIN to Mr Downing, I have concluded that the appropriate comparable is the rent that WIN agreed to pay Mrs Fitch and that the appropriate figure is the amount of $14,500 per annum for the year commencing 1 March 2006. Obviously, that is not an appropriate comparable for earlier periods. There are two ways of dealing with this issue. One is to discount the rent payable on 1 March 2006 to reflect the rent payable during an earlier period and to permit Mr Downing to recover interest on the discounted amounts. The other is to award Mr Downing the amount of $14,500 in respect of each year prior to 1 March 2006 but to make no award of interest. I prefer the latter approach. It is simpler. There was no evidence before me concerning an appropriate discount rate, and there is a degree of artificiality in discounting an amount at one rate to obtain its value at an earlier time and then allowing interest on that amount at a different rate to compensate for the delay in payment. In addition, although I have accepted that $14,500 is the appropriate comparable, the other comparables referred to by Mr Stack suggest that it is favourable to Mr Downing. In those circumstances, I do not think it is necessary to discount that amount and then add interest to the discounted amount to fairly compensate Mr Downing for his loss. 

33It follows that in respect of the period from 1 February 2001 to 28 February 2007, Mr Downing should recover rent at the rate of $14,500 per annum. Under the lease with Mrs Fitch, WIN pays rent annually in advance. There is no reason not to adopt the same approach in calculating Mr Downing's damages. Consequently, WIN should pay interest on the total amount from 1 March 2006 to the date of judgment at the rate determined in accordance with Practice Note SC Gen 16. For the period from 1 March 2007 to 29 February 2008, the rent should be increased by the increase in CPI for the immediately preceding year and WIN should pay interest on that amount from 1 March 2007. A similar approach should be taken for the 2 months commencing on 1 March 2008 and ending on 30 April 2008. 

34In my opinion, Mr Downing is entitled to recover interest on that proportion of the sub-licensing fees that I have held he is entitled to recover from the date that the relevant amounts were paid or payable to WIN. I accept that the calculation of those amounts is arithmetically complicated. However, there is no obvious simpler means of ensuring that Mr Downing is fairly compensated for his loss. Again, interest should be at the rate calculated in accordance with Practice Note SC Gen 16. 

Should damages be awarded against Prime Television and the State? 

35I have assessed the damages payable by WIN on the basis that it obtained exclusive possession of the relevant part of Mr Downing's property and was entitled to enter into sub-licences with others. In those circumstances, I do not think that Mr Downing can recover more than the amount that I have held that he is entitled to recover from WIN. To permit him to do so would be to permit him to recover twice for the same loss. 

36However, on the findings I have made, both Prime Television and the State were trespassers on Mr Downing's land and Mr Downing is entitled to recover damages from them in respect of that trespass if he does not recover the total amount of his damages from WIN. 

37In this case, there is no suggestion that WIN will not or is unable to pay the whole of the judgment awarded against it. There is, therefore, no utility in attempting to assess the damages payable by Prime Television and the State. In my opinion, it is appropriate to make no orders against Prime Television or the State but to give Mr Downing liberty to apply in the event that WIN does not pay the full amount of the judgment against it within 28 days from the date that this judgment is entered. 

Orders 

38The parties should bring in orders consistent with this judgment within 14 days. If they cannot agree on the form of orders within that time, the matter should be re-listed for further argument. 

39I will hear the parties in relation to costs.

		17 June 2011",2011-06-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757196,Maynes v Casey [2011] NSWCA 156,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P : I agree with Basten JA. 

2BASTEN JA : The applicants, Mr Lindsay Maynes and Mrs Susan Maynes, own a property known as ""Berkeley"" near Woodstock in the Shire of Cowra in western New South Wales. In 2008, the Shire Council alleged that they were in arrears in payment of rates. On 12 October 2008 the Council sought to serve the applicants with process to commence proceedings in the Local Court for the recovery of unpaid rates. Service was organised by the Council's solicitors, of which the second respondent, Mr Geoffrey Casey, was a partner. The process server was his son, Mr Samuel Casey. 

3On 22 May 2009, the applicants commenced proceedings in the District Court claiming damages against the respondents. Mr Samuel Casey was sued in trespass to land, assault and for breach of privacy. Mr Geoffrey Casey was said to be vicariously liable for the trespass to land committed by Sam Casey and to have been a party to certain breaches of privacy. By judgment delivered on 23 December 2010, the proceedings in the District Court were dismissed: Maynes v Casey [2010] NSWDC 285 (Sidis DCJ). 

4Having served a notice of intention to appeal, the applicants sought, by a notice of appeal filed within time on 16 March 2011, to appeal to this Court. On 1 April 2011, the respondents applied to have the appeal dismissed as incompetent, on the ground that, absent an appropriate affidavit demonstrating that the amount in issue was in excess of $100,000, it required leave. In support of their assertion that the damages claim fell well short of that figure, the respondents filed an affidavit annexing a document described as an ""invoice"" sent to the first respondent on 14 October 2008 claiming an amount of $19,500. The affidavit also attached a copy of the judgment, in which Sidis DCJ, against the contingency that she might be found to have erred in respect of liability, had assessed the damages payable at a maximum of $28,000. The respondents also complained that the affidavit of the applicants' solicitors, filed on 24 March 2011, merely asserted that he was ""informed by the appellants and believed"" that the claims had a value in excess of $100,000 and that the property on which the trespass occurred had a value in excess of that figure. 

5Whilst maintaining that the appeal lay as of right, on 21 April 2011 the applicants filed a motion seeking an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal (and leave to appeal). Further, on 3 June 2011 an affidavit of Mrs Susan Maynes was filed, asserting that she and her husband had been ""humiliated and very upset"" at the trespass upon their land and at the ""distressing and confronting"" behaviour of the respondents, after the service of the District Court process, in driving ""up and down upon our land"" in a manner ""designed to intimidate us from proceeding with our action"". Mrs Maynes annexed a ""psycho-legal assessment report"", dated 12 March 2010, which had apparently been prepared for the District Court proceedings. Based on the applicants' account of the events involving the respondents, the psychologist, Ms Margaret Johnson, expressed the opinion that there was ""sufficient evidence to suggest that Mr and Mrs Maynes experienced shock, mental distress, fear and anguish as a result of the intrusion into their home"". She stated that the ""negative consequences of the incident have endured since the incident and resulted in them becoming socially isolated and fearful of further intrusions"". She concluded that ""although the situation did cause a degree of psychological impact, this was not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of any psychopathology"". 

Legal principles 
6The first issue is to whether the applicants require leave to appeal. This depends upon the operation of s 127(2) of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW), which provides: 

"" 127 Right of appeal to Supreme Court 
... 
(2) The following appeals lie only by leave of the Supreme Court: 
... 
(c) an appeal from a final judgment or order, other than an appeal: 

(i) that involves a matter at issue amounting to or of the value of $100,000 or more, or 
(ii) that involves (directly or indirectly) any claim, demand or question to or respecting any property or civil right amounting to or of the value of $100,000 or more."" 

7This provision constitutes a statutory restriction on the right of appeal, imposed by reference to a specified amount or value: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 51.22(1). Accordingly, it was necessary for the appellant, on filing the notice of appeal, to file and serve an affidavit that identified the nature of the restriction and set out ""the material facts on which the appellant ... relies to show that the restriction does not apply"": r 51.22(2)(b). 

8The requirements of the rule will operate differentially, depending on the cause of action and the circumstances of the particular case. The present case involved three causes of action in tort, one involving a trespass to land, the second an assault caused by threatening behaviour and the third an invasion of privacy of the landowners. In each case the damages (if any) will be assessed according to the circumstances of the tortious conduct. That assessment will involve an evaluative judgment on the part of the court hearing the appeal or hearing a retrial, if the appeal succeeds. An affidavit by a solicitor expressing an opinion as to the amount of damages likely to be awarded is neither necessary, nor sufficient. What is required, in order to comply with the rule, is an affidavit setting out ""material facts"" which may demonstrate the likely amount of the damages: Ozpinar v Assaily [2001] NSWCA 23 at [12]-[14] (Powell JA, Sheller JA and Rolfe AJA agreeing); Kassem v Colonial Mutual General Insurance Company Ltd [2001] NSWCA 38 at [47] (Rolfe AJA, Ipp AJA agreeing); Bracks v Smyth-Kirk [2009] NSWCA 401 at [40] (McColl JA, Allsop P and Young JA agreeing). 

9The authorities do not identify in detail the nature of the material facts which should be set out in the affidavit. Where damages in tort are concerned, the relevant facts, to be proved at a trial, would no doubt include evidence from the plaintiff as to the nature of his or her injuries, together with medical evidence as to their extent and likely prognoses. Usually, the material evidence will have been presented at trial and will have been the subject of findings by the trial judge. Where the appellate challenge is to the assessment made by the primary judge on the basis of that material, it will be sufficient for a solicitor's affidavit to identify the relevant findings, together with material in the evidence which is said to support a higher (or lower) figure. It will be sufficient if such material allows the Court to be satisfied that the appellant has reasonable prospects of obtaining a variation in the judgment below in an amount equal to or exceeding the statutory figure: see Cole v The Commonwealth [1961] HCA 87; 106 CLR 653 at 656 (Dixon CJ, Windeyer and Owen JJ); Ebert v The Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1957] HCA 88; 98 CLR 172 at 175; Trad v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 41 at [15]-[19] (Tobias JA) and authorities there cited; Ross v IceTV [2010] NSWCA 272 at [8] (Sackville AJA, McColl and Macfarlan JJA agreeing); Pawlowska v Zajglic [2011] NSWCA 118 at [15]-[16] (Campbell JA). 

10In the present case, the solicitor's affidavit filed in support of the right to appeal failed to set out relevant material facts. While the rule in that regard was not complied with, it was nevertheless open to the appellant to demonstrate, by argument, based upon the findings of fact made by the trial judge, that the variation in amount sought was reasonably supportable, without reference to other factual material. 

11There remained an argument that, at least in relation to the trespass to land and the invasion to privacy, the applicants were entitled to rely on the value of the land, rather than the amount of the damages recoverable, pursuant to the second limb of the statutory definition. It was contended that the appeal involved a claim involving a question as to, or ""respecting"", property of the value of $100,000 or more. 

Competency of appeal 
12Counsel for the applicants contended that the conduct of the respondents was such as to warrant not merely findings of liability in favour of the applicants, but a judgment including aggravated and exemplary damages, in a figure well in excess of $100,000. He referred to cases in which such sums had been recovered, including State of New South Wales v Ibbett [2005] NSWCA 445; 65 NSWLR 168. However, the facts in that case, which involved turning a handgun on the plaintiff and other threatening conduct, bore little resemblance to the facts of the present case, as found by the trial judge, or even those asserted by the applicants. 

13Further, arguably the more serious conduct alleged against the respondents was the assault, in which the second respondent was not alleged to be involved, either personally or vicariously. Further, as appeared from the evidence, the allegedly threatening conduct was directed towards Mr Maynes, rather than his wife. No attempt was made in the course of argument to distinguish various aspects of the causes of action for the purposes of assessing damages. 

14At the heart of the applicants' argument in respect of an appeal as of right, lay the need to challenge findings of fact made by the primary judge. These were findings which led her Honour to the view that there had been no tortious conduct in any event. In respect of the trespass to land, the hypothetical basis of her Honour's assessment of damages could be undertaken on the assumption that the first respondent was aware of the absence of any express or implied permission to enter the land. Similarly, her Honour was in a position to assess damages payable on the basis that an implied consent was withdrawn, but that the first respondent had not left the property within a reasonable period. What her Honour did not do, and could not reasonably have done without making alternative findings of fact, was to assess the damages resulting from the assault, which she had found did not take place. The evidence of ""material facts"" put forward in support of the appeal as of right did not attempt to present a different factual case in relation to the alleged assault. Without such evidence it was implausible to suggest that the damages claimed could reasonably have been expected to exceed $50,000. 

15The alternative approach, based on the second limb of s 127(2)(c), was not available to the appellants. Their proposed appeal did not make a claim or demand, or raise a question, with respect to ""any property or civil right"", other than the causes of action identified. There was no dispute as to their entitlement to the land, either directly or indirectly. The cause of action based on trespass to land may involve an intrusion upon, or damage to, the land, but in an amount which is unrelated to the value of the freehold title. Accordingly, they must bring themselves within the first limb of s 127(2)(c) to establish their right to appeal: Oertel v Crocker [1947] HCA 40; 75 CLR 261 at 265 (Latham CJ); 271-272 (Dixon J), discussed in Nanschild v Pratt [2011] NSWCA 85 at [26]-[33] (McColl JA, Campbell JA agreeing). 

16It follows that the respondents' motion must be allowed and the appeal dismissed as incompetent. 

Application for leave to appeal 
17There is no doubt that the respondents were informed in a timely manner of the intention of the applicants to challenge the decision of the trial judge. (It is not necessary to state and consider at what point they were given notice of specific challenges which were not included in the original incompetent notice of appeal.) The respondents did not object to the application for an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal and time should accordingly be extended. 

18In order to justify a grant of leave to appeal in relation to a small claim, the applicants needed to establish: 

(a) that the adverse judgment in the District Court was attended by sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by this Court, and 
(b) that the case raised a matter of principle, or 
(c) that it was otherwise desirable, in order to maintain the regularity of the administration of justice, to grant leave to appeal. 

19In assessing relevant considerations, it is necessary to deal separately with the independent causes of action. 

(a) trespass 
20The applicants accepted that, absent evidence to the contrary, a person having legitimate business with the owner or occupier of premises will have an implied right to enter and remain on the premises until asked to leave. As expressed in Halliday v Nevill [1984] HCA 80; 155 CLR 1 at 7 (by Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ): 

""The most common instance of such an implied licence relates to the means of access, whether path, driveway or both, leading to the entrance of the ordinary suburban dwelling house. If the path or driveway leading to the entrance of such a dwelling is left unobstructed and with entrance gate unlocked and there is no notice or other indication that entry by visitors generally or particularly designated visitors is forbidden or unauthorized, the law will imply a licence in favour of any member of the public to go upon the path or driveway to the entrance of the dwelling for the purpose of lawful communication with, or delivery to, any person in the house. Such an implied or tacit licence can be precluded or at any time revoked by express or implied refusal or withdrawal of it. The occupier will not however be heard to say that while he or she had neither done nor said anything to negate or revoke any such licence, it should not be implied because subjectively he or she had not intended to give it ...."" 

21That principle was common ground: the question, one of fact, was whether the implication had been negated by one of three courses of conduct undertaken by the applicants. These were, chronologically: 

(a) the publication in 2006 in a local newspaper of a letter prepared by the applicants; 
(b) correspondence between the applicants and Cowra Shire Council, and 
(c) the positioning of a sign at a point where a public roadway commenced to cross their property. 

22The principal letter, published in the Cowra Guardian on 28 June 2006, pre-dated the supposed trespass on the applicants' land by more than two years. The correspondence was set out by her Honour at [88]-[90]. Her Honour did not accept that the respondents had read the correspondence, nor did she accept that the letter indicated that the applicants were attempting to give notice that they were withdrawing an implied right of entry onto their property to any Council officer, or other person: [114]-[116]. On what basis those findings should be overturned was not explained. 

23The second matter upon which reliance was placed was more closely contemporaneous with the events of October 2008. On 11 August 2008, the applicants wrote to the Council, setting out their views as to the legal entitlement of Council officers to enter property without permission. Her Honour set out the text of the letter at [95]. There does not appear to have been any suggestion that the first respondent was aware of the correspondence or that it alerted him to any requirement to obtain express permission before entering the property: at [106]. The second respondent, as a partner of the firm which had acted on occasion for the Council, was not shown to have any knowledge of the correspondence and denied the proposition that the correspondence itself effected a withdrawal of any implied consent to enter: at [104]-[105]. The trial judge accepted the evidence of the second respondent: at [117]-[118]. There is no reasonable prospect of challenging these factual findings. 

24The third and primary basis relied on by the applicants, as conduct withdrawing any implied consent, was the erection of a sign near a cattle grid where the road crossed the southern boundary of the applicants' property. (The wording of the sign identified legal authority, including the decision of the High Court in New South Wales v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57; 229 CLR 638, referring to a report which appeared in mid-2007, the sign presumably being erected at some point thereafter.) The trial judge found that the sign was positioned too far from the cattle grid to be visible at a time when the first respondent was negotiating the grid in the dark, the sign not being illuminated and, even if visible, its contents other than the word ""STOP"" not being legible. Her Honour therefore concluded that the sign was ""ineffective to communicate to the first defendant that implied consent to enter the property was withdrawn"": at [113]. 

25The objective circumstances supported the first respondent's denial of seeing the sign, despite the fact that he was looking for signs in order to locate the applicants' property: at [13]. There was no plausible basis upon which that finding of fact could be challenged. Nor did the applicants contend that any finding of liability in their favour depended on a conclusion that the first respondent should, exercising reasonable care and attention, have seen the sign. 

26In the result, the findings of fact were inconsistent with any awareness on the part of the respondents that the authority or licence implied by law, permitting the first respondent to drive up to the applicants' home in order to communicate with them, had been withdrawn. 

27The primary basis upon which the applicants sought to challenge the conclusion in respect of liability for trespass to land was a legal argument to the effect that if owners of property take reasonable steps to notify potential visitors that they have no implied permission to come onto the property, then lack of subjective awareness on the part of the visitor is irrelevant. 

28This legal proposition was said to derive from a number of cases, including Halliday , cited above and Plenty v Dillon [1991] HCA 5; 171 CLR 635. However, while the passages relied upon all support the principle that an implied permission can be withdrawn by notice, none stated that the mere publication of a notice, unbeknownst to the visitor, was sufficient to render that person a trespasser. For example, Plenty had been argued both in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia and in the High Court on the footing that there had been an express revocation of any implied consent: at p 638. There was no occasion to discuss how revocation might occur. The only authority referred to by the applicants which was squarely in point was against them. In Wilson v State of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 333, Hodgson JA, McColl and Young JJA agreeing, set out the principle in respect of a withdrawal of an implied licence to enter premises in the following terms at [51]: 

""Thus, in my opinion, the licensee must first have notice that the licence is revoked; and consistently with the general legal position in relation to the giving of notice, that requires a communication to the licensee, which the licensee understands as a revocation of the licence or which a reasonable person in the position of the licensee would understand as a revocation of the licence."" 

29On the facts found by the trial judge, there was a clear revocation of the implied licence only at about the time the applicants came to understand that the purpose that brought Mr Casey onto their land was to serve them with court process. A question then arose as to whether Mr Casey left within a reasonable time of the revocation being communicated: Cowell v Rosehill Racecourse Co Ltd [1937] HCA 17; 56 CLR 605 at 631 (Dixon J). Whether or not that occurred depended upon a combination of factual findings as to the precise events which occurred on the land on 12 October and an evaluative judgment as to what constituted a reasonable time in all the circumstances. The evidence of the applicants (and in particular of Mr Maynes) as to what occurred when Mr Casey arrived differed in a number of significant respects from Mr Casey's evidence. Her Honour noted the disparity in the accounts and preferred the evidence of Mr Casey: at [179]-[180]. She concluded at [181]: 

""I was not therefore satisfied that, although he did not leave the property immediately his authority to be there was withdrawn, he remained on the property for longer than was reasonably practicable."" 

30The assessment of the timing was critically dependent upon the findings of fact. Even if another view could have been formed as to the immediacy of Mr Casey's withdrawal from the land, unless her Honour's findings with respect to the assault allegation were to be overturned, the quantum of damages would be small and no wider purpose would be served by granting leave to appeal in that respect. Indeed, to do so would be entirely contrary to the purpose underlying the requirement of leave, namely to limit the delay, expense and inconvenience caused by litigation in this Court in cases having limited financial consequences. 

(b) assault 
31Mr Maynes gave evidence that he retreated backwards when he felt that Mr Casey was about to make contact with him. Mr Casey denied that he had been aggressive and stated that he came no closer than a distance of two metres from Mr Maynes: at [183]. Again, the conflict in the evidence was a matter to be resolved by the trial judge, which she did by accepting the account given by Mr Casey: at [185]. Her Honour also concluded that ""this evidence did not establish that [Mr Casey] intentionally created the apprehension in [Mr Maynes] that he intended to commit an act of violence that involved physical contact with [Mr Maynes]"": at [184]. 

32The applicants' complained that her Honour had not considered whether Mr Casey had been reckless in his behaviour, even if he had not intended to create an apprehension that he might use force against Mr Maynes. While there may be doubt about what was to be inferred from an absence of behaviour that ""intentionally or otherwise"" indicated an intention to assault, such language was at least consistent with a finding that any apprehension on the part of Mr Maynes was not, in all the circumstances, a reasonable response. Accepting that there may be doubts as to the precise formulation of the intention required for an assault (as discussed, for example, in Hall v Fonceca [1983] WAR 309 at 313-314 (Smith and Kennedy JJ)), there were, again, findings of fact which stood between the first applicant and any realistic possibility of recovering damages for such a tort. 

(c) breach of privacy 
33The conduct of the respondents which was said to give rise to a claim for damages for breach of privacy was set out by the primary judge at [33]-[61]. On four occasions in late May and early June, one or both of the respondents drove onto the road through the applicants' property and took photographs or film of the property. Each of the incidents occurred after the respondents had been served with the statement of claim issued by the applicants in the District Court. The asserted purpose of the visits was to obtain evidence to respond to the allegations in the statement of claim. 

34The absence from the common law of an established tort for unjustified invasion of privacy has been noted on more than one occasion. The judgments in the High Court in Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor [1937] HCA 45; 58 CLR 479 were once thought to stand in the way of the development of such a tort. That view has been held to be wrong: see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63, 208 CLR 199 at [108], Gummow and Hayne JJ, Gaudron J agreeing. The applicants relied on these remarks and on Giller v Procopets [2008] VSCA 236; 24 VR 1 (Maxwell P, Ashley and Neave JJA). Giller was a case in which the Victorian Court of Appeal considered a claim for damages for breach of confidence, arising out of the release of a videotape of sexual activities between a couple, since estranged. In particular, the Court considered whether damages could be awarded for emotional distress, falling short of psychiatric injury, caused by the breach of confidence. 

35These cases may well lay the basis for development of liability for unjustified intrusion on personal privacy, whether or not involving breach of confidence: cf John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Hitchcock [2007] NSWCA 364; 70 NSWLR 484 at [124]. The difficulty faced by the applicants lay in the findings of fact made by the trial judge in the following passages: 

""194 I accepted that the [respondents] went legitimately to Bullfrog Road, a public road, for the purpose of investigating the serious claims made against them by the plaintiffs. Their investigation necessarily involved inspection of the access road leading to the house paddock. 

195 I did not consider their conduct in undertaking these investigations to be an undue or serious invasion of any right to privacy possessed by the plaintiffs or to be highly offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibility."" 

36The applicants have failed to demonstrate any plausible basis upon which such findings of fact could be challenged. The case therefore provides an inappropriate vehicle to consider any possible developments of the law with respect to intentional invasion of privacy. 

Conclusions 
37For these reasons, the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed. The following orders should be made: 

(1) Dismiss the appeal filed on 16 March 2011 as incompetent. 

(2) Grant the applicants an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal until 21 April 2011. 

(3) Refuse the application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the District Court delivered on 23 December 2010. 

(4) Order the applicants to pay the respondents' costs of the motions as to competency, extension of time and seeking leave to appeal.

2757198,ELDRIDGE v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 144,"Judgment  1CAMPBELL JA:  I agree.  2RS HULME J:  I agree with Hoeben J.  3HOEBEN J:  Offence and sentence  On 27 April 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of supply prohibited drug, namely 12.72 grams of 1-benzylpiperazine contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  The maximum penalty is a fine of 2000 penalty units or imprisonment for 15 years, or both.  4On 10 June 2010 her Honour Judge Payne sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole of 11 months commencing 31 May 2010 and expiring 30 April 2011, with a balance of term of 9 months expiring 30 January 2012.  5In addition, her Honour sentenced the applicant for three offences on a Certificate under s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as follows:  (i) Conduct drug premises - imprisonment for one month to commence 31 May 2010.  (ii) Possess prohibited drug - imprisonment for one month to commence 31 May 2010.  (iii) Possess prohibited drug - imprisonment for one month to commence 31 May 2010.  6Since the three offences on the s166 Certificate were ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence of supply, the total effect of her Honour's sentences was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 months and a parole period of 9 months.  7The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence for the supply offence on the following grounds:  (i) The sentence was manifestly excessive.  (ii) Her Honour erred in the way she dealt with the presentence custody.  (iii) Her Honour erred in the way she dealt with special circumstances.  Factual background  8The following facts were agreed between the applicant and the respondent:  ""At about 2pm on Friday 12 June 2009 police attended a unit in Wentworth Road, Burwood and executed a search warrant.  The unit was a Housing Commission unit occupied by the applicant and his mother.  Upon entering the unit, the police observed six males and one female inside the premises.  There was a strong smell of cannabis within the unit.  Located close by the males was a packed cone in a water pipe and a mullamatic used to chop cannabis.  Police commenced searching the unit and located numerous resealable plastic bags in the lounge-room and one in the bedroom occupied by the applicant.  The bags contained green vegetable matter.  Prior to searching the applicant's room police told him that the police search dog had indicated his room and asked him if there was anything in there that he wished to declare.  He said ""There's probably some weed in there"".  In relation to other cannabis found at the premises, the applicant said ""It's mine, I smoke it, it's marijuana"".  The cannabis found in the applicant's unit came to a total weight of 161.1 grams.  Police continued to search and located a clear resealable bag containing 38 blue tablets contained in a plastic resealable bag inside a black bum bag that was sitting on a coffee table in the lounge-room.  The applicant was cautioned and questioned in relation to the 38 blue tablets to which he replied ""They're mine, I have a problem taking tablets as well.  I think they're Ecstasy, I think so, I don't know"".  When asked where he got them he said, ""Guys at Burwood Park"".  He told police he had paid a couple of hundred for them.  On later analysis the tablets were found to contain a mixture of 1-benzylpiperazine (19 percent by weight) and 1 -(3 - trifluoromethylphenyl) - piperazine (10 percent by weight).  Both are prohibited drugs with a similar effect to, and from time to time sold as Ecstasy.  The total weight of the 38 pills was found to be 12.72 grams.  Police continued to search the premises and located 1.85 grams of cannabis resin wrapped in foil on the side table in the lounge-room.  Police also found numerous, empty, small, resealable plastic bags in various locations in the unit.  Police conveyed the applicant to Burwood Police Station as the search warrant continued.  The applicant took part in an electronically recorded interview to which he agreed.  He told the police that he was at the time unemployed and receiving Newstart allowance and received about $420 per fortnight.  He agreed that police had located the 38 pills in his unit, along with a bong for smoking marijuana.  He declined to answer any further questions.""  9The applicant was arrested and taken into custody on 18 June 2009 and was refused bail.  Bail was granted to him on 21 October 2009 after he had been in custody for 4 months and 10 days.  Remarks on sentence  10The applicant gave sworn evidence in the sentencing proceedings.  He said that it was his intention to occasionally give these tablets to friends, but otherwise the bulk of the tablets were intended for himself.  He said that he never sold any of the pills or any other drug.  11Her Honour had before her a presentence report.  Her Honour concluded that this report was not a favourable one from the applicant's point of view.  12In relation to the applicant's evidence, by reference to a number of inconsistencies in it, her Honour concluded that he was a ""witness who could not be believed"".  Despite his exculpatory statements, her Honour found that the applicant had the tablets in his possession for the purpose of supply.  13Her Honour took into account that the quantity of drugs considerably exceeded the amount necessary for an indictable offence.  Her Honour also had regard to the comments of this Court as to the seriousness of drug supply offences.  She found that on the facts of this case, the principles of general and specific deterrence applied.  14In relation to the applicant's subjective case, her Honour had regard to the fact that he was 28 and that he did provide some assistance for his mother.  Otherwise she found that he had no real prior work history and had done little to obtain a job while he was at liberty on bail.  Despite the applicant's lengthy history of illegal drug use, he had no prior criminal record and her Honour was prepared to treat him as a person of good character.  15Because of his lack of insight, her Honour found that his prospects for rehabilitation were guarded.  She was, however, prepared to infer from his plea of guilty that he had shown remorse.  In relation to the plea of guilty, she found that this was a late plea and that its utilitarian value entitled the applicant to a discount of 10 percent.  16Her Honour was prepared to find special circumstances in the applicant's favour since this was his first time in custody and there was a need for rehabilitation.  17Her Honour summed up her approach to the applicant and the offence as follows:  ""In my view given the maximum penalty prescribed for this offence being imprisonment for 15 years, the requirement for general deterrence in this case, the seriousness of persons having drugs in their possession for the purpose of supply into the community, the effect that drug use and drug addiction has on the community, the devastation it creates to those who engage in the activity and the negative effect it has upon families and friends means in my view that nothing other than a custodial sentence is appropriate in this case.""  (ROS 7.5)  18In relation to the commencement date of the sentence, her Honour said:  ""Accordingly, taking into account the 4 months and 10 days in custody I impose the following sentences.  Firstly, the sentence I would have imposed prior to reduction for utilitarian considerations is one of 2 years and 3 months.  That reduced by 10 percent is 2 years and 9 days rounded to 2 years.  It will then be reduced by 4 months to take into account the presentence custody.  Further, the sentence will commence 10 days prior to today to take into account that portion of the presentence custody.""  (ROS 8.3)  The appeal  Ground 1 - The sentence was manifestly excessive.  19The applicant primarily relied upon statistics to make out this ground of appeal.  By reference to 510 cases involving the supply of an indictable amount of Ecstasy, he submitted that in only 25 percent had a sentence of fulltime imprisonment been imposed.  He noted that only 49 percent of offenders had received a longer sentence and that only 42 percent had received a longer non-parole period.  The applicant made specific reference to two cases R v Bradley [2004] NSWCCA 88 and R v Payne [2005] NSWCCA 85.  He submitted that the criminality in those cases, by reference to the amount of drugs and the behaviour of the offenders, had been considerably more serious than on his part but that they had received roughly the same sentence.  20The applicant also referred to the amount of the drug which he had in his possession, which was towards the lower end of the indictable range, the low purity of the drug and his lack of a previous criminal record, as justifying a conclusion that her Honour's sentence was manifestly excessive.  21I do not agree.  Even on the statistics put forward by the applicant, it is obvious that this sentence was well within the range of sentences for offences of this kind.  22In relation to the applicant's reliance on statistics generally, this Court has said on a number of occasions that sentencing statistics are of only limited value.  The wide range of culpability and of factors relevant to sentencing are not taken account of in a simple statement of offence and sentence.  The large number of variables which go into the passing of a sentence are simply not reflected in statistical figures and percentages.  23What is important when considering a particular sentence are the specific findings as to the objective seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender.  These are the considerations which are determinative when assessing whether a particular sentence is manifestly excessive, rather than a comparison of the sentence with statistics ( Holloway v R [2011] NSWCCA 23 at [85]).  A critical question is whether the sentence imposed was appropriate for the particular case ( R v F (2002) 132 A Crim R 308, adopted in Ayoub, Omran v R; El Masri, Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 196 at [58]).  24In formulating the sentence her Honour took into account those matters, i.e. the seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender.  She has not been shown to have been in error by reference to sentencing statistics.  25The reference to the two decisions of Bradley and Payne does not assist the applicant.  As was said by this Court in R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247 at [48]:  ""48 ... It is necessary to restate that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching sentence appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority:  see Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; Regina v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994 and Regina v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J at 98 - 101.  At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing ..."".  26Moreover, the two cases are not truly comparable.  In Bradley as well as the supply offence, there were four separate drug offences contained on a Form 1.  The applicant had a very strong subjective case. She was found to be a street level dealer, aged 22 with a ""sad"" history and to be a person ""full of potential"".  She had pleaded guilty at an early point in time, received a 25 percent discount, had fully co-operated with the police and was found to have genuine contrition with a real desire to reform.  These matters are in stark contrast to the applicant's case.  27Payne was a Crown appeal.  In accordance with the sentencing principles then in effect, the re-sentencing by this Court took into account double jeopardy and was towards the bottom of the range for offences of that kind.  In that case also the offender had a much stronger subjective case than this applicant, i.e. he was found to be ""an intelligent and hard working self-employed businessman"".  By comparison, the applicant in this case was part of a web of drug users each involved in supporting the others and jointly purchasing drugs for their consumption.  28This ground of appeal has not been made out.  Ground of Appeal 2 - Her Honour erred in the way that she dealt with the pre-sentence custody.  29The applicant submitted that her Honour did not explain why the commencement date of the sentence was not backdated so as to allow him a full credit for the 4 months and 10 days which he had spent in custody before obtaining bail.  The applicant submitted that this lack of any adequate explanation or reasoning was particularly troubling because her Honour had treated his pre-sentence custody in two quite different ways, i.e. reducing the head sentence by 4 months and then backdating the commencement date of the sentence by 10 days.  30I have concluded that there is substance in the applicant's submission. I appreciate that it was not mandatory for her Honour to treat the applicant's pre-sentence custody in any particular way, and that she was not prohibited from taking the approach which she did.  Nevertheless, the treatment of pre-sentence custody in two different ways was quite novel and in the particular circumstances of this case, the applicant was entitled to an explanation.  31Section 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 relevantly provides:  ""47(2) A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:  (a)  is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed,  ...  (3) In deciding whether or not to make a direction under subsection (2) (a) with respect to a sentence of imprisonment, and in deciding the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced, the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, any of the offences to which the sentence relates.""  32These sections have given rise to an important rule of practice to the effect that generally a court should backdate a sentence to take into account pre-sentence custody: R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588; R v Deeble (NSWCCA, 19 September 1991, unreported); R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245.  33The benefits of that rule of practice were explained by Howie J in R v Newman; R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102 at [29] where his Honour said:  ""29 The practice of backdating the sentence also makes it obvious to the offender that he, or she, has received a reduction in the sentence for the period already spent in custody. It ensures that there can be no argument, such as is now presently before this Court, as to whether the discount was in fact given even though the sentencing judge said that the time served in custody was taken into account in the sentence imposed. The importance of this aspect of sentencing was recognised in R v Phillips and Simpson and in R v Galati [2003] NSWCCA 148. In Galati James J, with whom Smart AJ agreed, said:  ""[36]...................It is true that, while a sentencing judge is required to take a period of pre-sentence custody into account, it is not obligatory for the sentencing judge to take the period of pre-sentence custody into account by the means of backdating the commencement of the sentence and that in Howard the Chief Judge at Common Law left open the option of reducing a sentence to be imposed so as to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody. However, in the present case, I consider that, notwithstanding the sentencing judge's assertion in his remarks on sentence that he had taken into account the first period of presentence custody, the first period of presentence custody is not demonstrably reflected in the sentences which were imposed. The first two sentences, on which the other two sentences depend, were made to commence from 18 January 2002, a commencement date which would allow only for the second period of pre-sentence custody. The sentences which were imposed were for round periods of whole years, which tends to militate against any conclusion that an irregular period of one month and twenty six days was really taken into account.""  30 The practice also avoids questions of disparity erroneously arising because a sentence, with which comparison is being made, has been markedly reduced by pre-sentence custody. Such a sentence, particularly where there are few comparable sentences for similar offences, can also skew the statistical information derived from sentences imposed by other courts and give a false indication of the range of sentences that have been imposed for a similar offence or on a similar offender.  ...  33 The present case is a good example of why the practice laid down in McHugh should continue to be applied and, in my opinion, the fact that a sentence would have to be backdated to a period when the offender was not in custody in order to comply with the practice is not a good reason for failing to follow it. In the present case, his Honour clearly reduced the head sentence by reason of the period served but there is a valid question arising as to whether the non-parole period was also reduced.""  34More recently in Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30 this Court held that backdating the commencement date of a sentence was the normal course to be adopted unless the sentencing judge indicates why that course was not appropriate in the circumstances.  35There Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed, said:  ""3 This Court has repeatedly stated that the preferable course to adopt, where an offender has served a period of pre-sentence custody, is to backdate the sentence imposed by a period equivalent to the pre-sentence custody. In R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245, Giles JA stated:  ""[22] This Court has on a number of occasions said that it is desirable that a sentencing judge back-date a sentence to take into account pre-sentence custody. It is not necessary to go further back than R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588 and what may be regarded as the definitive decision in R v Deeble (19 September 1991, unreported), in which the reasons for the practice are outlined: they need not be repeated here. Subsequent cases included R v Reid (26 March 1997, unreported) and R v Foster (30 October 1996, unreported). The desirability is put not as something which is mandatory, but as a rule of practice of importance, and in my view the importance should be emphasised once again. If a sentence is not back-dated to take into account pre-sentence custody the reason or reasons for not doing so should be clearly stated.""  ...  7 Despite the repeated endorsement of this Court for the preferable course of backdating a sentence to reflect the period of pre-sentence custody, this is yet another case where the sentencing judge has not taken that course and yet given no reasons for not having done so. The result is an application for leave to appeal that could have been avoided by the simple expedient of commencing the sentences imposed upon the applicant six months earlier than the date of sentencing.  8 I cannot understand why the preferred course is not universally adopted. It has everything in its favour as was made clear in the decision in McHugh almost 25 years ago: it is simple, transparent and does not result in an apparently lesser sentence being imposed than was actually served by the offender. There is nothing that can be said in support of the alternative method. In my view it should cease unless there is a good reason, which the judge clearly specifies, for not adopting that approach. ...""  36In this case her Honour did not offer any explanation for why she adopted such a novel approach to the pre-sentence custody of the applicant.  Counsel for the Crown in the course of this hearing was unable to offer any explanation.  In those circumstances, and given the very clear guidance forcefully expressed by this Court on a number of occasions, I am of the opinion that her Honour did err in the way in which she treated the applicant's pre-sentence custody and that this ground of appeal has been made out.  Ground of Appeal 3 - Her Honour erred in the way that she dealt with special circumstances.  37The applicant submitted that although her Honour made a finding of special circumstances, she failed to expose how she gave effect to it.  38It would have been helpful if her Honour had made clear how she gave effect to her finding of special circumstances.  That having been said, the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence is 55 percent.  That of itself is the clearest indication of how her Honour used her finding of special circumstances.  That is particularly so when one has regard to the provisions of s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which prescribes that the balance of term of a sentence must not exceed 25 percent of the whole sentence unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances.  In this case that ratio which favours the applicant is much higher.  It follows that there is no basis for the applicant's complaint and that this ground of appeal has not been made out.  Conclusion  39Although her Honour erred in relation to how she treated the applicant's pre-sentence custody, this does not end the matter.  The Court has to decide whether the commencement date for the sentence should be so backdated, i.e. the Court has to decide whether in accordance with s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 any lesser sentence than that which was passed is warranted.  I have concluded that a lesser sentence is not warranted and that the sentence passed by her Honour was appropriate.  40Having regard to the nature of the offence, i.e. the supply of drugs, the seriousness with which the community regards the offence and the damage which it causes, together with the requirements for personal and general deterrence, any further reduction in the non-parole period would bring about a sentence which was manifestly inadequate.  This is particularly so when one has regard to the applicant's guarded prospects of rehabilitation and the modest nature of his subjective case.  41The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.  **********

2757248,R v Sukkar [2011] NSWCCA 140,"Judgment 

1Simpson J: I agree with Davies J. 
2Davies J:     On 6 August 2010 the Respondent stood trial before her Honour Judge Wells SC and a jury charged with an offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was found guilty. On 26 November 2010 he was sentenced by Judge Wells to a term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing 6 August 2010 with a non-parole period of 10 months with such non-parole period expiring on 5 June 2011. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 

3The Crown appeals against the sentence on the basis that it was manifestly inadequate. 

4The Crown case was one of a joint criminal enterprise with the co-offender Dean Kriticos. In short, the Respondent drove the motor vehicle in which Kriticos was a passenger, the Respondent waited in the motor vehicle whilst Kriticos entered the premises intending to rob the occupiers therein, and then drove Kriticos from the scene afterwards. 

5Kriticos pleaded guilty to the same offence, and as part of his plea in mitigation he undertook to give evidence against the Respondent at the trial. Pursuant to that undertaking he gave evidence at the Respondent's trial. 

6Kriticos was sentenced on 22 April 2010 by Judge Solomon. Judge Solomon discounted by 50% the sentence he said he would otherwise have imposed to reflect the early plea of guilty and the assistance to be given. He then found special circumstances to vary the 3 year sentence so that ultimately Kriticos received a sentence of a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months with a balance of 1 year and 2 months. 

Facts 

7Her Honour found the following facts set out in her Remarks on Sentence. 

This offender and Dean Kriticos, as it turns out, had been friends having grown up in the same neighbourhood. On the evening leading up to this offence, somewhere between 7.30 and 8 o'clock, this offender and Kriticos went to the Roxia [sic] Hotel in Rockdale. They stayed until closing time, that is, about 1.30 am. 

During the night whilst the two men were out this offender withdrew $490 from his account through an ATM in six separate transactions. It was the evidence of Kriticos that they wanted to stay out but needed more money and that is when the idea of a robbery came up. 

The offender disputed that he needed any extra money at all and produced evidence to show that he had very significant sums of money in his bank accounts that he had saved from wages and over the years. 

This offender says that he only continued to be out in the company of Mr Kriticos that night because he was there supporting Mr Kriticos who had recently broken up with a girlfriend and was otherwise in poor spirits. 

The offender drove Kriticos to his house where Kriticos states that he obtained a knife, a beanie and a dumbbell. According to Kriticos the offender saw the items and asked him if he had everything ready. This is a matter of factual dispute that needs to be resolved. 

They went to a nearby service station, according to Kriticos, where he intended to use a dumbbell to break into the shop of the service station and steal money. However, he saw that the cash register was opened and empty so he got back into the car and threw the dumbbell away soon after. The two of them then drove to Oxford Street in Surry Hills. It was the evidence, again, of Kriticos that there was discussion between them about the offence that they were to commit, that is, that there was some sort of loose plan to commit a robbery probably of the sex shop in Oxford Street. 

As to the facts this offence involved robbery at the Adult Triple X City Sex Shop in Oxford Street, Surry Hills at around 3 am on 27 June 2009. This offender was the driver of the getaway car. His accomplice, Dean Kriticos, armed himself with a knife and after entering the upstairs shop Kriticos approached Mr Yaseen Khan, the only person who was present and working in the shop at the time. Kriticos demanded money. He told Mr Khan that he did not wish to hurt or hit him, however, when Mr Khan removed the key from the cash register Kriticos punched him in the face and there was a physical struggle. 
Mr Khan eventually escaped and ran from the shop calling for help. Kriticos grabbed the entire till and ran from the shop across Oxford Street and to the offender's vehicle which was waiting or parked in a side street almost directly across from the crime scene. 

Once Kriticos got into the vehicle that was driven away by the accused. 

From the point that the victim and Kriticos exited the steps from the shop until the time that Kriticos got in the car and was driven away, there is a CCTV recording of that aspect of the offence. 
Soon after the money was removed, the till was thrown from the car along Crown Street. 

After the robbery occurred Mr Khan, the complainant, called the police. After viewing the CCTV footage police obtained the registration of the getaway car which, in fact, was a utility vehicle owned by this offender. Police contacted the offender's mother, however, he had not yet reached home. His mother phoned him and told him that the police wanted to speak to him. He arrived home sometime afterwards and parked his car away from the home in a nearby street. 

Later in the morning police found his ute and made contact with the offender. He co-operated by meeting them where his ute was parked. He was arrested and taken to the police station and there he was interviewed. 

During the interview the offender admitted he was the driver of the vehicle but he had no real knowledge that the offence was going to take place. He nominated Kriticos as the offender. 

Further details from the interview are as follows: 

1. The accused told police he had plenty of money and did not have to rob sex shops. He said he only found out about the robbery when Kriticos returned the car after the event. (Q and A 28). 

2. The offender told police that they had a fantastic night at Roxia [sic], that he consumed a little bit of alcohol. He said that Kriticos was complaining about never having money and wanting money. They drove towards Oxford Street to finish off the night. He said when they arrived he was quite tired and decided to have a rest. Kriticos said he was going to ""sus things out"". 

The offender said about twenty to twenty-five minutes later the accused woke him up, got in the car and told him that he did not believe that he had done this. He said (referring to the robbery) that Kriticos was shocked at what he had done. Kriticos said it was ""a spur of the moment thing"". He drove off in an orderly fashion. He did not speed. He said there was not much in the till probably about $280. He said he was a little bit in shock himself. (Q and A 52). 

3. He denied there was any talk about a robbery at the Roxia [sic]. He said it was never planned. He said, ""I think he just got to breaking point (referring to Kriticos) so, that he just didn't care. Maybe he was intoxicated. Maybe he thought he was on another level"". (Q and A 85). 

4. The offender said to police that he was not intoxicated that night, just tipsy. He said he was driving and likes to keep himself to a point where he knows what he is doing. (Q and A 100-101). 

5. He said that he knew that Kriticos wanted to make some cash and that he did not think it was going to go to that extent. (Q and A 119). 

6. The offender said he asked Kriticos, ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" (Q and A 120). 

7. Kriticos said to him that he wanted to make some money. He wanted to rob something. He did not say exactly what he was going to do. (Q and A 121). 

8. Kriticos said to him that he did not want to hurt anybody. He just wanted to make money and the only way he could do it was to steal it somehow. (Q and A 123). 

9. The offender said that this conversation occurred as they got in the car and drove towards the city. Kriticos said the only way that he could do it was to steal it somehow. The offender said that a [sic] certain point he told Kriticos that he should just do whatever made him happy because there is only so much you can say to somebody. The offender said that Kriticos was not planning on getting big money, he just wanted a few hundred. The offender said he did not think he was going to do it yet and that he was just thinking about it. (Q and A 128-130.). 

10. The offender said that Kriticos wanted to rob the till, that he wanted to do it in an orderly fashion. He just wanted for them to hand over the money and for him to walk away. (Q and A 133). 

11. Kriticos did not actually say to the offender what shop or what he was going to do, he just mentioned a till. (Q and A 138). 
12. The offender said he was not aware that Kriticos had any weapons. 

13. The offender said that when they arrived in Oxford Street they had a cigarette. Kriticos the said he was going to try something. The offender said he thought that meant he was just going to ""sus things out"". The offender told Kriticos that he was just going to chill out. (Q and A 187 -188). 

14. The offender said he was shocked when Kriticos came back to the car with the whole till. (Q and A 193). 

15. The offender said that he agreed to pull over to drop off the till because he did not want it in the car any more. (Q and A 212). 

8Based on these matters her Honour made 4 significant findings as follows: 

In relation to the facts, firstly and mostly significantly, I find that there is no evidence that this offender had any knowledge or expectation that Kriticos would strike the complainant in the face or struggle with him as he did. That is a feature that in my view distinguishes this matter to a considerable degree from that of Kriticos. 

Secondly, I find that although there were on the evidence of both men some discussions about getting some money by either robbing or stealing (I note that those words were used interchangeably) from someone I am satisfied that the conversations about that were vague and in the offender's mind this offence did not become a reality until shortly before the commission of the offence and once they arrived in Oxford Street. 

Thirdly, although there was evidence from Kriticos that the offender knew about his possession of a knife soon after they went to his house and during the drive into Oxford Street, again, I am not satisfied that the offender knew or realised the knife would be used until just before the commission of the offence. 

Fourthly, I am not convinced that this accused sought to profit himself by the commission of the offence, rather he was simply tagging along out of the sense of misplaced loyalty with his friend Kriticos who was very much in need of money and support. 

Subjective features 

9Her Honour noted that the Respondent was aged 29 years at the time of sentence. He had no criminal record and had been on bail for a period of 14 months without a breach. 

10Her Honour noted a report from a psychologist Sam Borenstein who assessed the Respondent and administered a Personality Assessment Screener that indicated his potential for emotional and/or behavioural problems was substantially less than is typical for community adults. There was nothing that alerted the need for psychological intervention. 

11The report, as her Honour noted, showed a very good work record with the employer describing the Respondent as a valued and hard worker, and that the employer would be offering a return to his position as a courier driver after his release from prison. 

12The Respondent also had a supportive partner and family with whom he was close. 

13Her Honour also noted that the Respondent disagreed with the police facts, and maintained his innocence at all times stating that he did not plan or take part in the commission of the offence. Her Honour noted in that regard that that was in contrast with the verdict of the jury and, in any event, that it flew in the face of the Respondent's own version of events which showed that he played a part in the commission of the offence as an accessory after the fact. Her Honour said that his continuing declaration that he did not play any part in the commission of the offence was quite wrong and troubling when one came to consider the issue of remorse. 

Her Honour's sentencing considerations 

14Her Honour considered the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 which indicated a starting point of 4 to 5 years as the appropriate range in matters like the present. Her Honour thought that there were many similarities with the factors referred to in Henry . There was, however, one particular factor that her Honour thought distinguished it to a considerable degree, and one lesser factor. The lesser factor was that the Respondent was in an older age range than the usual offender considered to fall within the Henry Guideline, but her Honour said that that was of no assistance to him except that he had reached the age of 29 years with no prior offences. 

15The significant distinguishing factor was of the Respondent being an accomplice - being neither the principal offender nor the instigator of the offence. Her Honour thought that the starting point would be markedly less than the range of 4 to 5 years, justified by the Respondent's relatively minor and belated involvement in the offence. 

16Her Honour considered a number of cases concerning the role of a second degree principal offender or aider and abetter including Johnson v R; Moody v R [2010] NSWCCA 124, R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 and GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198. 

17Her Honour then dealt with the Sentencing Remarks in respect of Kriticos. She noted that in evidence before her Kriticos conceded that he lived a life that involved the use over a number of years of illicit drugs, and of deceit. She thought that that was a significant factor that distinguished the Respondent from Kriticos. 

Grounds of appeal 

18The Notice of Appeal contained only a ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, but the Crown in its submissions identified 4 grounds as follows: 

1.Her Honour made a factual finding that was not reasonably open to her ""that the offender did not realise that the knife would be used until just before the offence"", and was inconsistent with the jury's verdict. 

2. Her Honour erred in the assessment of the seriousness of the Respondent's involvement in the robbery particularly in comparison with his role in the joint criminal enterprise with Dean Kriticos. 

3. Her Honour gave too much weight to the differences between the Respondent's subjective features, as opposed to those of his co-offender's, Dean Kriticos. 

4. Her Honour's sentence was manifestly inadequate. In particular, her Honour failed to impose a sentence that complied with the guideline judgment in R v Henry . 

Ground 1 - the facts found 

19In relation to Ground 1 the Crown identified the 4 factual findings of her Honour (set out in para [8] above) that she used to impact on the objective gravity of the Respondent's involvement. These findings can be summarised as follows: 

(i) That he had no knowledge or expectation that Kriticos would strike the victim; 

(ii) That the discussions prior to the robbery were vague, and the appreciation of the robbery committed by the respondent was only formed shortly before it began; 

(iii) The respondent only knew the knife would be used just before the commission of the robbery; 

(iv) The respondent did not desire to make money from the robbery. 

20The Crown accepted that the findings numbered (i), (ii) and (iv) were open to her Honour. The Crown disputed, however, that it was reasonably open to her Honour to find that the Respondent did not know that the knife would be used until just before the offence. 

21The Crown submitted that although the finding of facts after a jury's verdict was a matter for her Honour, the facts found had to be consistent with the jury's verdict and based on the evidence before her: R v Ronald John Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. 

22The Crown case of a joint criminal enterprise relied on the evidence of Kriticos. The evidence of Kriticos was relevantly this: 

Â· that he had a discussion with the respondent at the Roxy Hotel of the need to obtain more money 

Â· That they agreed to do a robbery/stealing 

Â· That the respondent drove to Kriticos' house whereupon he obtained a knife and a dumbbell 

Â· That he openly had the knife out on his lap as the respondent drove the car and opened and closed the knife 

Â· That he left the car with the knife and dumbbell at an earlier stage in order to commit an offence at a service station 

Â· That he got back in and still had the knife out, when they drove to Oxford Street to commit the robbery. 

23The Respondent's evidence was that he knew nothing about Kriticos having a knife, getting a knife from the house, or having it in the car, and that he never discussed being involved in a robbery with Kriticos. 

24The Crown submitted that the jury must have rejected that evidence of the Respondent or they could not have convicted him. The Crown submitted, therefore, that her Honour had no basis to speculate that the Respondent only became aware that the knife would be used immediately before the robbery. There was no evidence of that sort in the trial at all. 

25In R v Ronald John Pilley Finlay J (with whom Handley JA and Allen J agreed) said (at 203-204): 

It is, of course, the Judge's responsibility to determine the facts relevant for sentence consistent with the establishment of the essential legal ingredients of the crime; whether by way of admission on the plea of guilty or as in this case, pursuant to the jury's verdict of guilty. ( Veen v Regina (1919) 143 CLR 458 per Stephen J 466; Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 283 per Mason J and Maher v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 221 at 228 per Mason J, Wilson J and Toohey J. I add to those references the following passage from the judgment of Gibbs CJ, Wilson J and Dawson J in Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 276: ""If there is a trial by jury the ordinary incidents of such a trial will apply; the Judge will continue to exercise his traditional functions, and, for the purpose of imposing a sentence within the limits fixed by the law will form his view of the facts, provided, that that view is not in conflict with the verdict of the jury."" 

The following basic propositions can be stated: (1) Once there is a verdict or plea of guilty it is entirely for the Judge to determine the relevant facts for the purpose of sentence in conformity with the essential elements of the crime which such verdict or plea establishes. ( Regina v Martin (1981) 1 NSWLR 640 at 643 per Hope JA; Regina v The Accused (1988) 1 NZLR 422 at 426 and 427; Saffron (No. 3) (1988-9) 39 A Crim R123 at 125). 

26The Respondent was convicted of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, and the jury's verdict was reached because the jury must have been satisfied that the Respondent was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with Kriticos. When her Honour found as a fact that the Respondent did not know or realise the knife would be used until just before the commission of the offence, she did not find that fact inconsistently with the jury's verdict. 

27Where the Crown accepts that it was open to the Judge to find that the Respondent only formed the appreciation of the robbery committed shortly before it was committed (fact (ii) above), it must therefore have been open to her Honour to make the finding about when the Respondent knew or realised the knife would be used. Provided that it is found that the Respondent was aware that the robbery was to be committed and that it involved the use of a knife at some time before Kriticos left the car, the findings were consistent with the jury's verdict. In that way the facts found are in conformity with the essential elements of the crime which the verdict established. Put the other way, the finding of those facts does not conflict with the jury's verdict. 

28The principle established in the cases referred to does not require the Judge to assume that the jury must have accepted all of the evidence of one witness and none of the evidence of the other. Nor does it require the assumption that the jury concluded that the facts must only have been as one or any other of the witnesses recounted them. That is because the essential elements of the crime do not involve a determination of when the Respondent must have known or realised particular matters provided he knew or realised them before Kriticos left the car. 

29No error is shown in this regard and I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Grounds 2 and 3 - comparison with co-offender 

30When Judge Solomon sentenced Kriticos it is clear from his remarks that he considered that the appropriate starting point was a 6 year sentence. The guideline judgment in R v Henry held that a range of 4-5 years was appropriate. The Sentencing Judge said that in her view the starting point would be markedly less than the range of 4-5 years imprisonment proposed in Henry because she considered the lower starting point was justified by the Respondent's relatively minor and belated involvement in the offence. Her Honour went on to say that the Respondent's role was one of waiting across the road as the driver of the car. She said it could not be suggested that he took any other role and certainly not one where he might be ready and able to assist Kriticos if required during the commission of the offence. 

31She noted that Judge Solomon regarded the involvement of Kriticos as falling outside the Henry Guideline in a more serious category on the basis of the actual violence that was committed against the victim. She noted what Judge Solomon said about the criminal record of Kriticos and his significant history of poly-substance abuse and dependence. She said she bore in mind the principles of parity and in that regard she distinguished the Respondent from Kriticos on the basis of his different and lesser role and his superior subjective details when compared to Kriticos. She said also that she distinguished his involvement by reason of his motivation, which was not in order to obtain money (there was evidence that he had plenty of money in his account that was drawn on during the course of that night) but in a sense as part of a misguided loyalty to Kriticos. 

32The Crown submitted that her Honour erred in the assessment of the relative criminality of the Respondent's conduct by finding such a disparity of seriousness between the Respondent and Kriticos on the basis that he was the ""getaway"" driver. 

33The Crown then set out a number of matters which suggested there was little difference between the co-offenders, either when judging the objective features of the crime or the subjective circumstances of each of them. In relation to the objective features the Crown referred to a number of decisions concerning the proper approach to sentencing those involved in a joint criminal enterprise particularly where the roles of the participants differed. In relation to the subjective features the Crown set out the matters considered by the Sentencing Judge including his age, his criminal record and his background, and compared the position of Kriticos with regard to those matters. 

34A number of submissions made by the Crown, in relation to the way Kriticos was dealt with by comparison with the Respondent, might be thought to amount to submissions on a parity argument between the sentences given to each of the offenders. The Crown denied that this was so and said that the point of the submissions was the Henry guideline and the objective gravity involved in the offences that led to the sentences given. 
35It is difficult to see how grounds 2 and 3, in the way they have been formulated, can be seen as other than grounds based on the parity principle. An assertion that there was error in the assessment of the seriousness of the Respondent's involvement particularly in comparison with the role of the co-offender, and an assertion that her Honour gave too much weight to the differences between the Respondent's subjective features when compared to those of the co-offender can only be considerations involving the parity principle. 

36To the extent that the grounds do not raise the parity principle they seem only to deal with the proper approach to sentencing for a joint criminal enterprise particularly where the co-offenders have different roles in the enterprise. Although the starting point is that the offenders were parties to the same joint criminal enterprise, and that should not be lost sight of, ( Johnson v R; Moody v R at [4]), and that one should not identify the differences in the roles with any precision ( R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 at [18], R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [161], Johnson v R; Moody v R at [11]), it is always relevant to refer to the particular conduct of each such participant with a view to identifying the level of culpability for which each must be sentenced ( R v JW at [161], and see Johnson v R; Moody v R at [4] and [94], Regina v Darwiche & Ors [2006] NSWSC 1167 at [74], Regina v Rick Barry Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [72] and [74]). 

37The Crown accepted that the roles of the Respondent and Kriticos could be differentiated by reason of the violence employed by Kriticos and ""to a very limited extent"" that the Respondent was the getaway driver. The Crown submitted, however, that that could not justify a difference between a starting point of 6 years and 2 years. 

38However, there were other differences identified in the 4 factual findings set out in paras [7] and [18] above. Those factual findings meant that there were significant differences in the roles of the Respondent and Kriticos. It is clear from the evidence of Kriticos that he had planned the robbery by no later than the time that he retrieved particular items including a knife and a dumbbell from his house. Further, findings (ii) and (iii) show not only a lack of planning on the part of the Respondent but that he was only confronted with what Kriticos intended to do a very short time before Kriticos alighted from the car. Factual finding (iv) provides a further, albeit less significant distinction in their role. 

39In relation to the Respondent being the driver, her Honour made express reference to Barr AJ's comments in Johnson v R; Moody v R at [94] where he said: 

In my opinion his Honour was correct to distinguish between the roles the two offenders played. It was more serious to enter premises and repeatedly level a firearm and threaten people's lives then to wait outside in a car. ... 

40I would reject grounds 2 and 3. 

Ground 4 - manifest inadequacy 

41The principal submission of the Crown in relation to this ground was that the Respondent fitted well within the factual matters to be considered according to Henry at [162], but that the sentence given by the Trial Judge bore little resemblance to the Henry Guideline range for the sentence. The Crown submitted that the only difference between the Respondent and the Henry Guideline was the Respondent's age which the Crown submitted worked both in favour of, and to the disadvantage of, the Respondent. In those circumstances, the Crown submitted, there was no basis for the Respondent being moved outside the Henry Guideline, let alone moved so far outside it that he received a sentence of 2 years after a trial, and 4 years less than Kriticos. 

42The Crown further relied upon the earlier errors said to have been made by the Sentencing Judge, including the fact finding process and the distinction made between Kriticos as the principal offender and the Respondent as the getaway driver. 
43I do not agree that the only difference between the Respondent and the Henry Guideline was the Respondent's age. The factual findings made by the Sentencing Judge are significant for the Respondent in relation to the planning of the robbery. So too was the weight given by the Sentencing Judge to the difference in the roles of the co-offenders. 

44As the Crown properly acknowledges the narrow range provided for in Henry is a starting point, and aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range: Henry at [169]. It is clear that subjective factors are included as mitigating factors - see at [170]. 

45The Respondent submitted that the Sentencing Judge was not bound to follow the Guidelines set out in Henry having regard to the criminality of the Respondent and to the objective factors as found by her Honour. The Respondent submitted further that the subjective factors pointed to a clear case for leniency. The Respondent further submitted that if the sentence is found to be manifestly inadequate the Court should take into account matters suggesting that it was the Respondent's assistance to the Police that enabled them to identify and find Kriticos. The material relied on in this regard, including the ERISP and the transcript of the trial, was not provided to the Court. 

46In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 the High Court discussed what is meant by a sentence being manifestly inadequate. The Court said: 

[59] As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen , ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong, appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"". Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong , ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error"". 

[60] The Court of Criminal Appeal also said that ""manifest error is fundamentally intuitive"". That is not right. No doubt, as the Court went on to say, manifest error ""arises because the sentence imposed is out of the range of sentences that could have been imposed and therefore there must have been error, even though it is impossible to identify it"". But what reveals manifest excess, or inadequacy, of sentence is consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence. The references made by the Court of Criminal Appeal to the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of each offender were, therefore, important elements in the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

[61] The applicants' submissions criticising the sufficiency of the reasons given by the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out that the Court of Criminal Appeal identified no specific error in the sentencing judge's findings of fact or reasons. That is right, but because the only ground advanced by the Director was the ground of manifest inadequacy, it had to be assumed that the Director alleged no specific error. That the Court of Criminal Appeal identified no specific error is, therefore, unsurprising. The absence of identification of such an error does not bespeak error on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The reasons given by the Court of Criminal Appeal for concluding that the sentences passed were manifestly inadequate sufficiently revealed the bases for that conclusion. 

47No specific error by the Sentencing Judge has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, the sentence imposed is considerably less than the range suggested as a starting point in Henry . Whilst accepting that it is a starting point and that, here, there were subjective features which might be thought to have reduced the appropriate sentence, it seems to me that a sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of 10 months was manifestly inadequate. Particular matters suggesting the manifest inadequacy are that there was no plea of guilty and that the Respondent must be accepted as having been part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit a robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, albeit in a less significant role, which ought to have been judged in accordance with the Henry Guideline judgment. 

48The Respondent's submission that her Honour was not bound to follow the Guidelines in Henry is not a submission that provides any assistance to the Court. The principles associated with guideline judgments were set out in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and reiterated in Henry at [2]-[31]. In particular, Spigelman CJ (with whom the other 4 members of the Bench agreed on the point) said at [31]: 

Nevertheless, where a guideline is not to be applied by a trial judge, this Court would expect that the reasons for that decision be articulated, so that the public interest in the perception of consistency in sentencing decisions can be served and this Court can be properly informed in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. 

49In her Remarks, having referred to the matters that I have set out in paras [13] and [14] above her Honour then said: 

At any rate, in my view the starting point in this matter will be markedly less than the range of four to five years imprisonment proposed in the Guideline as I consider it justified by the offender's relatively minor and belated involvement in the offence. 

At a further point in her Remarks her Honour said in relation to the Henry Guideline: 

I am prepared to distinguish this matter in a significant way due to the difference firstly in terms of his role in the offence and his motivation, which as I found was not in order to obtain money but in a sense as part of a misguided loyalty to Kriticos. 

... 

Further, I should indicate that compared to Dean Kriticos this offender has outstanding subjective factors that would mitigate his sentence. He has always been in gainful employment in particular and has lived the life of a law-abiding citizen and a valued member of the community. 

50When the maximum penalty for the offence is 20 years imprisonment, and when the Henry Guideline suggests a starting range of 4-5 years in a case where there is a plea of guilty, I do not consider that her Honour has articulated sufficient reasons for departing, and departing so considerably, from the starting point of the Guideline range. 

51In my view the sentence imposed is outside the range of sentences that should have been imposed, and ""therefore there must have been an error, even though it is impossible to identify it"": Hili at [60]. I would uphold this ground of appeal. 

Re-sentencing 

52Despite error having been demonstrated it is first necessary to consider whether the appeal should be upheld in the light of the residual discretion available to the Court in a Crown appeal. 

53Because of the shortness of the sentence imposed, and because the sentence was backdated to 6 August 2010, the Respondent was entitled to be released to parole on 5 June 2011. There can be no criticism of the Crown in relation to the timing of the appeal. Nevertheless the appeal is only being disposed of at a time after the expiry of the non-parole period. 

54The delay in resolution of an appeal, particularly where the non-parole period imposed by the Sentencing Judge has already expired is a proper factor to be taken into account in relation to the residual discretion in this Court whether or not to uphold the Crown's appeal: R v Hernando (2002) 136 A Crim R 451 at [40]; R v Cheung [2010] NSWCCA 244 at [151]; R v Tsoukatos & Kyroglou [1999] NSWCCA 106 at [3], [4] & [98], and see R v Everett (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 305. 

55Although consideration must be given to the fact that the non-parole period has expired through no fault of the Respondent, it does not seem appropriate to permit such an inadequate sentence to stand in the light of what was said in Henry . 

56In my opinion, the appropriate course to adopt is that which was taken by Simpson J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreed) in Tsoukatos & Kyroglou at [105] and by Simpson and Howie JJ in R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [60]. 

57Here the Sentencing Judge found special circumstances and was justified in doing so. The Respondent should not be returned to custody. Rather, he should be re-sentenced so that he receives a total sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 10 months with the sentence to commence on 6 August 2010 and the non-parole period to expire 5 June 2011. 

58I propose the following orders: 

(1) Appeal allowed. 

(2) Quash the sentence imposed by Judge Wells SC. In lieu, the Respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 months commencing 6 August 2010 expiring 5 June 2011 with balance of term of 2 years and 2 months to expire on 5 August 2013. Since the Respondent has already been released to parole it is not necessary to make the order under s 50(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

59Grove AJ: I agree with Davies J.

		24 June 2011",2011-06-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757265,R v Hawi & ors (No 10) [2011] NSWSC 1656,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown proposes to call as a witness Mr Rodney Moore. Mr Stratton SC, on behalf of the accused Christian Menzies, has objected. He relies upon the sanction provided in s 146(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Mr Young SC, on behalf of the accused Canan (aka Ishmail) Eken, joined in the objection. 

2The evidence is of some significance. According to his statement, Mr Moore witnessed the incident that the Crown alleges constituted an affray in the vicinity of Gate 5 at the Qantas Domestic Terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. The statement includes the following: 

4. About 2pm I was sitting at Gate Lounge 5. My wife and I were just resting there. I heard some swearing. I heard one bloke say, ""I've fuckin got something for you"". Middle eastern, possibly Lebanese. He was 6 foot 2 inches tall. He was wearing a black T shirt and jeans. He had a short back and side haircut (which) looked like it had been razored. 

5. I saw the man who had been swearing walk over to an electric cart. I then saw another male who was also wearing a black T shirt and jeans. He was also about 6 foot tall. He then king hit another male. This man was about the same height but was a bigger build. I then saw both males who were wearing black start to punch him. I saw the two males then punch an older male who went straight to the ground. They then started to kick him 3 or 4 times. 

3The statement was taken by an Australian Federal Police officer, Mark Semmens, on 22 March 2009. It was handwritten in the officer's notebook. (I have made some spelling and punctuation corrections in the above extract). 

4It is the Crown case that the accused Menzies and the accused Eken were participants in the alleged affray at Gate 5. More specifically, the Crown alleges that Mr Menzies punched Mr Derek Wainohu ""a couple of times"": Crown Case Statement at [51]. 

5In her opening address to the jury, the learned Crown Prosecutor described Mr Menzies as being about 6'3"" tall, wearing grey tracksuit pants and a black T-shirt with a logo (T47). She described Mr Eken as being about 6'5"" tall, wearing a black T-shirt with yellow markings on it (T46-47), the markings being a Comanchero logo, and brown pants (T54). She described Mr Wainohu as wearing a black T-shirt, pants and carrying a bag (T54). 

6The Crown Prosecutor also referred in her opening address to an anticipation that the jury would hear evidence of ""some general descriptions by eyewitnesses consistent with Christian Menzies having been involved in both the affray and the riot, and by that I mean by his height and by his clothing"" (T74). 

7The accused were all charged on various dates in 2009. They were committed for trial, after a lengthy committal hearing, in September 2010. The jury were empanelled in this trial on 24 May 2011. The statement by Mr Moore was not disclosed by police to the prosecutors until Friday 3 June 2011. The prosecutors, in turn, disclosed it to the representatives of each of the accused on Monday 6 June 2011. Mr Stratton accepted that this was not as a result of any mala fides on behalf of the police and he also accepted that the prosecutors were previously unaware of the existence of the statement. Evidence was led on the voir dire which provides some explanation for the late disclosure. 

8I have mentioned that Federal police officer Semmens recorded the statement of Mr Moore in the officer's notebook on 22 March 2009. Mr Semmens, himself, made a statement on 31 March 2009. Within that statement appears: 

""8. ... After I completed that I stayed and guarded the crime scene until detective Senior Constable Swan asked me to take a witness statement from Rodney James MOORE. After taking that statement ... "" 

9The statement by Mr Semmens was received by investigators on or before 21 May 2009. It was entered into their ""eagle.i"" database by Detective Sergeant Walpole and classified as statement number 206. The notebook entry, that is the statement by Mr Moore, was not annexed to the statement. 

10Investigators adopted an unusual practice in this matter because they held a concern for the safety of civilian witnesses. They obliterated from all documents served as part of the brief of evidence all the names of the civilian witnesses and any other identifying information. The witnesses were referred to by number rather than name. In accordance with this practice, the statement of Mr Semmens, which was included in the brief of evidence provided to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and served upon the accused's representatives, had Mr Moore's name obliterated. However, no number or other means of identifying who it was that Mr Semmens had obtained a statement from was substituted. Thus, the prosecution and defence lawyers were aware that Mr Semmens had obtained a statement from a witness, but they had no way of knowing who the witness was. It would be understandable that it would be assumed that this was a witness statement that was included in the brief of evidence. Regrettably, it was not. 

11A copy of Mr Semmens' notebook entry was received by investigators sometime on or before 25 September 2009. Plainclothes Constable Scott Thompson, an officer of very limited experience, entered the details in eagle.i on that date. He scanned the relevant notebook pages but, instead of categorising it as a ""statement"", it was categorised as an ""other text document"". The latter was a category used for a wide variety of miscellaneous documents. Documents that were categorised as a ""statement"" were easily identified as requiring disclosure whereas ""other text documents"" were not. 

12Constable Thompson also prepared on 25 September 2009 a brief description of the content of the notebook entry. He added: 

""Rodney was contacted 25/9/2009 and asked if he remembered anything further form (sic) that day, he did not. He was asked if he could give any further descriptions of the males or if he could recognise them again, he could not. 

Rodney and his wife [text obliterated] Inv passed on S/F Metter's contact numbers and informed him that if either him of (sic) his wife remember anything further they should contact Inv ASAP. 

The altercation at Gate 5 is very well covered via numerous independent witness statements, and any formal statement from Rodney or his wife would be pointless. Rodney MOORE's initial notebook statement is sufficient and is recorded in S/Cst Mark SEMMENS (AFP) notebook"". (The abbreviation ""Inv"" apparently is a reference to ""investigator"" or ""investigators""). 

13Constable Thompson's handling of the notebook entry, including the notes above, was reviewed by Detective Sergeant Walpole. He said in his evidence on the voir dire that he did not have an independent recollection now of his thought processes on 25 September 2009. The best he could do was to suggest that he must have assumed that there was no problem with the scanned notebook pages being entered as an ""other text document"" because he had also assumed that Mr Moore's statement was already within eagle.i and classified as a ""statement"". Detective Walpole also said in his evidence that there was no advantage to be gained by police in not disclosing the existence of the statement. There is much force in that, but I note in any event the acceptance by Mr Stratton that this was a case of inadvertence rather than deliberate concealment. 

14It was sheer happenstance that the existence of the statement came to light at all. The Crown Prosecutor's instructing solicitor recently was preparing a response to a request by solicitors acting for the accused Hawi for a copy of notebook entries made by any Australian Federal Police officer. She reviewed all federal police officers' statements and came across the one by Mr Semmens. She noted that a copy of the notebook entry referred to in it was not annexed. She made inquiries which resulted in the statement being found. 

15The objection by Mr Stratton was taken in reliance upon s 146 of the Criminal Procedure Act : 

146 Sanctions for non-compliance with pre-trial disclosure requirements 

(1) Exclusion of evidence not disclosed 
The court may refuse to admit evidence in proceedings that is sought to be adduced by a party who failed to disclose the evidence to the other party in accordance with requirements for pre-trial disclosure imposed by or under this Division. 

16Section 146 is part of the case management provisions in Ch 3 Pt 3 Div 3 that were inserted by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Case Management) Act 2009 and took effect from 1 February 2010. 

17At a pre-trial directions hearing on 11 March 2011, upon the application of the Crown Prosecutor, I made an order pursuant to s 141 that the prosecutor give notice in accordance with s 142; that the accused give notice of the defence response to the prosecution's notice in accordance with s 143; and that the prosecutor give notice of the prosecution response to the defence response in accordance with s 144. A timetable for compliance was specified. 

18Section 142, which sets out the prosecutor's obligations pursuant to such orders, is in these terms: 

142 Prosecution notice-court-ordered pre-trial disclosure 

For the purposes of section 141 (1) (a), the prosecution's notice is to contain the following: 

(a) the matters required to be included in the notice of the prosecution case under section 137, 

(b) a copy of any information, document or other thing in the possession of the prosecutor that would reasonably be regarded as adverse to the credit or credibility of the accused person, 

(c) a list identifying the statements of those witnesses who are proposed to be called at the trial by the prosecutor. 

19The incorporation of the provisions of s 137 in s 142(a) is significant as s 137 relevantly provides: 

137 Notice of prosecution case to be given to accused person 

(1) The prosecutor is to give to the accused person notice of the prosecution case that includes the following: 

... 

(c) a copy of a statement of each witness whose evidence the prosecutor proposes to adduce at the trial, 

... 

20The proposal of the Crown ""to adduce at the trial"" the evidence of Mr Moore did not arise until 3 June 2011 because until that date it was completely unaware of the existence of his statement. Accordingly, there was no obligation on the Crown prior to that date to give to the accused notice by way of providing a copy of his statement. 

21It was in accordance with the ongoing obligation of disclosure, previously required generally under the common law, but in the present context also under s 147, that the Crown disclosed the statement of Mr Moore on 6 June 2011. 

22What of the failure of police to disclose the statement of Mr Moore to the prosecutor? There is a statutory obligation upon police officers investigating alleged indictable offences to disclose to the Director of Public Prosecutions all relevant information, documents or other things obtained during the investigation that might reasonably be expected to assist the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused: s 15A(1) Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. That duty is a continuing one: s 15A(2). 

23There was a breach of that provision. However, as earlier indicated, it is common ground that this was completely inadvertent. Whilst referring me to the provisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act , Mr Stratton maintained his focus upon the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act . He submitted that the disclosure requirements in the latter should be construed so as to incorporate the police within the prosecutor's obligations and therefore attract the sanction in s 146(1). With the greatest of respect to Mr Stratton I was not persuaded by such submissions. 

24The disclosure obligations under Ch 3 Pt 3 Div 3 are concerned with the prosecutor. The term ""prosecutor"" is defined in s 3: 

3 Definitions 

(1) In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires: 

... 

prosecutor means the Director of Public Prosecutions or other person who institutes or is responsible for the conduct of a prosecution and includes (where the subject-matter or context allows or requires) an Australian legal practitioner representing the prosecutor. 

25I am unable to see that ""prosecutor"", in the context of a case prosecuted on indictment by the Director of Public Prosecutions, can be construed so as to include police investigators. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the failure of police to disclose the statement of Mr Moore was not a failure to disclose of a type that renders available the sanction in s 146(1). 

26It remains, however, to be considered whether there has been such unfairness as a result of the late disclosure of Mr Moore's evidence such that it should be excluded in any event. 

27Mr Stratton referred to the fact that his client had been required by the orders I made on 11 March 2011 to make disclosure and that he did so in the absence of knowledge that there would be evidence in the trial by Mr Moore. However, upon closer examination of this submission, it became clear that nothing had been disclosed at all in terms of Mr Menzies' case in respect of the affray. In other words, there is no embarrassment or detriment to Mr Menzies' defence by anything he was compulsorily required to disclose for the simple reason that he failed to comply with the requirement that he disclose, pursuant to s 143(c), whether he took issue with the Crown's contention that he was a participant in the Gate 5 affray, and that in the course of this he punched Mr Wainohu. Theoretically, and somewhat ironically, that would leave Mr Menzies himself open to the application of the sanction in s 146(1). I note that the obligation to comply with the requirements of the pre-trial disclosure imposed upon Mr Menzies is a continuing one: s 147(1). 

28A more significant issue is the terms of Mr Stratton's opening address to the jury. It included him asserting that he expected that the jury would not hear any eyewitness identifying Mr Menzies taking part in the fighting at Gate 5 ""or even give a description which closely matches the appearance of the accused as it was on 22 March 2009"" (T116.42)(emphasis added). 

29A number of points should be noted about this. First, opening addresses are about the evidence that counsel ""expect"" that the jury will hear. Juries are told, as they were in this trial, that they are not evidence in themselves. Secondly, it is sometimes the case that counsel tell juries what they ""expect"" the evidence will be, only to find that the evidence is not exactly as ""expected"". 

30The third point is that the Crown has indicated that Mr Moore has indicated in a conference with prosecutors that the person he described in paragraph 4 of his statement was carrying a bag which he put down after walking over to an electric cart. The description of the man in paragraph 4 of Mr Moore's statement, coupled with the first sentence in paragraph 5 and that additional evidence disclosed by Mr Moore in conference, means that the person was likely Mr Derek Wainohu and not the accused Menzies at all. The description given in the balance of paragraph 5, the Crown submitted, ""could"" match Mr Menzies, but that is as high as it goes. The Crown does not contend that it ""closely matches"" him, and with that I agree. 

31Finally, and regardless of the third point, it is really moot whether the descriptions provided by Mr Moore in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his statement meet the characterisation of descriptions which ""closely match"" Mr Menzies. That was Mr Stratton's concern. But the descriptions are fairly broad. With all of the evidence the jury has heard in this trial, at least to date, it is most likely that they will regard descriptions as being general impressions more than accurate, definitive and pin-pointing of a particular accused. I exclude from this anything that is particularly unique, for example, a man dressed in predominantly white clothing (i.e. the accused Hawi). 

32My conclusion is that there is no cause for embarrassment or prejudice in the manner in which Mr Stratton opened to the jury in response to the Crown case as he then understood it to be, in the light of it subsequently being disclosed that the Crown sought to add to its case the evidence of Mr Rodney Moore. 

33The objection is overruled. The evidence is admissible.

2757268,Police v JM [2011] NSWChC 1,"JUDGMENT 

Remarks on Sentence 

1In respect of the matters on papers 2010/00357156 the young person pleaded guilty to the following charge: 

That (he) on 20 September 2010 at South Albury in the State of New South Wales did break and enter the office of the Country Comfort Hovell Tree Motel, situate at Wodonga Place and then in the said office did commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny in circumstances of aggravation, namely he was in company with another person namely Joshua VANDERVENTER and Joseph HARMER, contrary to s. 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

2In addition to that charge the young person asks that when passing sentence in respect of that charge I take into account a further ten matters on a Form 1 document. Those ten charges include six counts of Aggravated Break Enter and Steal, two counts of Aggravated Break Enter with Intent to Steal, one count of Break Enter and Steal simpliciter and one count of Possess Prohibited Weapon. On papers 2010/00322681 is one count of Resist Police and one count of Fail to Appeal. On papers 2010/00357141 is one count of Larceny. 

3So far as the charge of Aggravated Break Enter and Steal is concerned it is agreed between the parties that the offender is entitled to the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. However, it is appropriate to observe that Spigelman CJ said in R v Thompson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 at [160(iv)]: 

In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount. 

4The matters on the Form 1 document in my opinion substantially affect the outcome in this matter. I mean by this not the issue of the discount to be allowed for the plea, but the ultimate sentence. In respect of the approach to the taken in matters involving Form 1 schedules, Spigelman CJ giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; [2002] NSWCCA 518 (Guideline Judgment on Form 1) said at [42]: 

The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another"". 

5It appears from the papers that the position with the other matters (Resist Police, Fail to Appear and Larceny) is such that the offender is entitled to the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty in those matters. 

Facts - Principal Count 

6As is customary in the Local and Children's Courts the facts were presented by way of a Police Fact Sheet, which in this case was tendered without apparent objection. I will proceed to sentence on the basis that what is disclosed in the Fact Sheet are agreed facts. The fact sheet recites: 

About 10.45 pm on Sunday 19 th September 2010 the reception building of the Country Comfort Hovell Tree Motel situated at the intersection of Wodonga Place and Hovell Street, Albury was locked and secured. 

About 12.15am on Monday 20 th September 2010 the co accused Joshua Vanderventer, co accused Joseph Harmer and young person (were) stopped by police in Spencer Street Albury. Police obtained their details and left shortly thereafter. 

Before 5.45am the co accused Harmer, co accused Vanderventer and the young person have attended the rear of the main reception building and forced open a locked and secured security door by forcing the door off its tracks. 

The co accused Vanderventer and young person entered the premises and opened a further door allowing entry to the co accused Harmer. All three persons were wearing hand coverings and covering their heads with hoods. 

The three persons made their way into the restaurant area and proceeded behind the bar where the cash register was. Nil money was contained within and a number of bottles of alcohol were taken and transported outside the building. A LG 50 inch plasma television was removed from the wall and taken from the premises. 

All three persons have moved through the kitchen into the front reception area where a security grate enclosing the front reception desk was forced open. The office was ransacked and the rear office off the reception area accessed whereby the young person located the key to the safe. The safe was opened and money was stolen from the safe totalling $4,980.75. 

The three persons left the premises and moved the television and bottles of alcohol to the neighbouring church grounds where they were left. The cash was retained by the offenders. The three persons made their way to outside McDonald's Restaurant on Hume Street and obtained a taxi. 

About 5.45am the offence was discovered by staff of the Country Comfort and police notified. The proceeds were recovered from the church grounds and the Plasma television valued at $1,800 recovered with damage to the actual screen. 

Facts - Form 1 offences 

7The facts for the individual matters are recounted on the Fact Sheet. However, as the offences are included on a Form 1 schedule I will deal briefly with them. There are six counts of Aggravated Break Enter and Steal, two counts of Aggravated Break and Enter with Intent to Steal, one count of Break Enter and Steal simpliciter and one count of Possess a Prohibited Weapon, namely a cross bow. Three of the counts on the Form 1 related to old offences committed in March and April of 2007. The aggravation relied upon in the remaining three counts of Aggravated Break Enter and Steal on the Form 1 is being in company. I note that the persons in whose company this young offender was were the same as with the principal count. In the old (i.e. 2007) matters, the property included data projectors, a small quantity of cash, a small quantity of alcohol and a briefcase. The more recent matters were committed between 9 September and 6 October 2010. The value of the property nominated on the Form 1 document is approximately $6,600. 

Facts - Resist/Hinder Police, Fail to Appear 

8The matter involves a minor struggle with police and the young person in the early hours of the morning of 23 September 2010. Police saw the young person and other young persons exit a motor vehicle and run from the scene. Upon being informed he was under arrest the young person ""pushed away at police and stood up in a threatening manner"". He was thereafter threatened with capsicum spray and complied with directions from police. He failed to appear in accordance with a Bail Undertaking at the Albury Children's Court on 12 October 2010. 

Facts - Larceny 

9This offence occurred at Maitland on 13 October 2010 while the young person was in the company of Joshua Vanderventer. The offender picked up a large black handbag that had been accidentally left behind by its owner. The owner went back to collect her bag and saw the offender rummaging through the bag. She called out ""that's my handbag"". The offender ran from the scene eventually throwing the bag onto rocks near the water's edge at the river. The offender was apparently identified by CCTV footage. 

Assessment of the criminality 

10The offence of Resist Police is towards the bottom of the range of seriousness for offences of that type that routinely come before the court. The resist is a push, and when threatened with capsicum spray the young person became compliant. The larceny was opportunistic in nature, although no doubt very distressing to the owner of the handbag. I assess that matter at being well below the halfway on the scale of seriousness of matters of that type. 

11I turn now to the Aggravated Break Enter and Steal charge. I assess that matter at being slightly below the half way mark on the scale of seriousness. The premises were commercial and the offence occurred at a time when it was unlikely that persons would be present. Cash and other property to the value of about $6,500 was taken. 

Maximum Penalty 

12The maximum penalty for the offence of Aggravated Break Enter and Steal if dealt with on Indictment is 20 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of five years. The only relevance of that in the Children's Court is that it is a clear indication of how seriously the Parliament views the offence. The offence carries the same maximum penalty as a charge of Aggravated Robbery. 

13The sentencing limit in the Children's Court is a Control Order for no more than 2 years - see s 33(1)(g) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. On this issue, Schmidt J giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in HMP v R [2010] NSWCCA 63 said at [59]: 

The jurisdictional limit of the Children's Court may not be regarded as a sentence reserved for a worst case (see the discussion in McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94 at [26]). 

14It is tolerably plain therefore that the two years provided by s 33(1)(g) is properly regarded as a jurisdictional limit rather than the maximum sentence available. I will proceed accordingly. 

Criminal History - Offences committed while on Parole 

15The young person for a person of his age has a lengthy record for offences of Break Enter and Steal going back to 2007. He was sentenced to Control Orders for multiple offences of Break Enter and Steal in August 2008 in the Albury Children's Court. He committed the offence of Recklessly Cause Grievous Bodily Harm in Company on 25 March 2009. He pleaded guilty to that matter and I committed him for sentence to the District Court using powers contained within s 31 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. He was sentenced to a total sentence of 2 years with a non-parole period of one year and one month. 

16Accordingly, the young person committed the principal count of Aggravated Break Enter and Steal and 7 of the matters on the Form 1 Schedule while he was on parole for a serious matter of violence. The commission of further offences while on parole is a matter of aggravation - see s 21A (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the decision of R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289 at [41] per Harrison J. 

Matters of General Principle 

17In R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme & Hislop JJ) said at [30]-[31]: 

30 It is also to be observed that nowhere in Attorney-General's Application (No 1) under s26 of the Criminal Appeal Act, R -v- Ponfield and Ors was doubt cast upon the appropriateness of most of the remarks the Court has quoted from the earlier cases. Indeed in R v Scott [1999] NSWCCA 434, one of four cases considered and in which judgement was delivered at that same time as the guideline judgment, Sully J, with whom the other judges agreed, quoted remarks of the sentencing judge in that case and observed that they were correct in principle. These remarks were: - 

""The incidence of break, enter and steal throughout the State, but in particular on the Central Coast of New South Wales, is such as to cause grave disquiet in the community. 
In the court of the first trial, a fingerprint expert gave evidence to the effect that he attends some ten locations a day in the course of investigating burglaries. The burglar seems to act with impunity, such is the frequency of this crime, which is carried out with brazen contempt for the law and the rights of innocent householders. 
Right thinking members of the community are understandably angry and frustrated at the seeming immunity enjoyed by the burglar. Their dwellings are ransacked. Their goods spirited away where they will be inevitably received by some Cash Converter, loan office or pawn broker. The operators of such businesses deal with vast volumes of stolen goods on a daily basis. The fact that successive governments neglect to pass efficacious laws which might tend to hinder the daily conversion of stolen goods into money is of great comfort to the burglar and of no assistance whatsoever to the victim. 
It is a notorious fact that householders face huge premiums, as well as the vast expense of endeavouring to make their homes secure, against those who apparently consider it their right to break into households and take whatever goods suit their purposes. 
Clearly the community has the rightful expectation that judicial officers will act responsibly and impose meaningful penalties on the rare occasion when the burglar is apprehended and convicted. 
Other would-be burglars just might be deterred when it is learnt that the crime of break, enter and steal is regarded as being grossly serious and will attract serious punishment."" 

31 Although in Attorney-General's Application (No 1) under s26 of the Criminal Appeal Act, R v Ponfield and Ors the Court declined the Crown's application to provide a guideline in quantitative terms, the Court indicated that a court should regard the seriousness of an offence contrary to s112 (1) as enhanced and reflect that enhancement in the quantum of sentence if any of a number of specified factors are present. Included among the factors mentioned and relevant to the situation of the Respondent here were:- 

(i) The offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty; 
(ii) The offender has a prior record, particularly of like offences; 
(iii) The multiplicity of offences (reflected either in the charges or matters taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s21 of the Criminal Law Procedure Act); 
(iv) The value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value. 

18A little later in 2007, the Court of Criminal Appeal handed down its decision in R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255. Howie J (Gyles JA, Fullerton J agreeing) said at [38]: 

38 In relation to multiple offences of break enter and steal the appropriateness of concurrent sentences has been specifically considered by this Court in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130, a decision handed down a month before the Judge sentenced the respondent. That was a case that emphasised that heavy sentences should generally be imposed for break enter and steal offences committed by repeat offenders on domestic premises, whether or not they were aggravated forms of the offence. 

19There is now also authority for the proposition that the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in decisions such as Harris and Merrin also apply to commercial premises. In France v R [2010] NSWCCA 24 Davies J (James & Howie JJ agreeing) said at [27]-[29]: 

This matter has effectively been answered when considering the totality principle under Ground 1. The Applicant had an extensive criminal history, the offence concerned was committed whilst the Applicant was on conditional liberty, the offence showed a measure of professional planning, organisation and execution, damage was done to various items of property and the value of the goods stolen was not insignificant. These were all matters that were identified as factors which enhanced the seriousness of the offence in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48]. 

28 In R v Clifford [2008] NSWCCA 190 Price J said at [65]: 

""This Court in R v Harris (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 emphasised that heavy sentences should generally be imposed for break, enter and steal offences committed by repeat offenders on domestic premises, whether or not they were aggravated forms of the offence. To my mind, there is no good reason why what was said in Harris should not apply to repeat offenders who break into business premises."" 

20Given the offender's record and the multiplicity of offending with which I am dealing, I am of the view that the young person can accurately be described as a repeat offender. I often observe when presiding in the Children's Court that young offenders seem to regard Breaking and Entering into other people's home and businesses as some type of recreational activity. It is serious criminal offending, and will be treated accordingly. 

21I now turn to the matters of general principle in dealing with juvenile offenders. Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provides: 

A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles: 

(a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
(b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
(c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
(d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
(e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind, 
(f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties, 
(g) that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions, 
(h) that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim. 

22I note that s 33(2) of the Act provides that the Court shall not (and it therefore is in mandatory terms) deal with a person under subsection (1)(g) (i.e. a sentence of a Control Order) unless it is satisfied that it would be ""wholly inappropriate"" to deal with a person under subsections (1)(a)-(f). 

23McClellan CJ at CL in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 at [21]-[26] succinctly summarised the authorities relating to sentencing juvenile offenders. His Honour was ultimately in dissent on the ultimate issue, however, with unfeigned respect, that part of the judgment is an excellent summary of the relevant principles. It has since been recognised as such in many decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. His Honour said at [22]-[26]: 

The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society's norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. These principles were considered in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116 (NSWCCA), R v E (a child) (1993) 66 A Crim R 14 at 28 (WACCA) and R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511; [2002] NSWCCA 349 at [30]. 

23 The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender's youth and not just their biological age. ( R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25]). The weight to be given to the fact of the offender's youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence ( Hearne at [24]). Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult. ( Hearne at [25]; MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 93; [2005] NSWCCA 397 at [61]). 

24 Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct. In R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 Lee CJ at CL said (at 135): 

""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes , particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of Williscroft (1975) VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment ie coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society."" 

25 The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity ( R v Bus, unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995, Hunt CJ at CL; R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[10]; R v TJP [1999] NSWCCA 408 at [23]; R v LC [2001] NSWCCA 175 at [48]; R v AEM Snr, KEM and MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[98]; R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [31]; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [16]). In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ""adult behaviour"" ( Voss at [14]), the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence ( Adamson at [31]-[32]). Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. 

26 The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person's youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity ( R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). A 'child-offender' of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age ( R v Bus, unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [15]). However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth ( Hearne at [27]). 

24In the matters presently under consideration the young person was on parole, had a lengthy history and was very close to his eighteenth birthday. The young offender in fact turned 18 in March of this year. I also note the circumstances of the offences. In these circumstances I am very firmly of the opinion that the emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution should be moderated. I also note the multiplicity of the offending as detailed on the Form 1 schedule. 

Juvenile Justice Background Report 

25Again, this Court is indebted to the author of the Background Report. Mr Timothy Wilson, the author has obviously invested a great deal of time and industry in the preparation of the Report, which this Courts finds extremely helpful. Appropriately, Mr Hemsley relied heavily on the Background Report. 

26It would appear that the young person has not enjoyed a stable home environment. He lived with his mother until he was about 13 years of age, and has been with other family members at various locations since then. He witnessed domestic violence in his formative years. In July 2007 the offender's mother was imprisoned in respect of a serious matter of violence towards the offender's father. It appears from the Report that the family life settled after the offender's mother was released from custody. he young offender has used a number of illicit substances over a considerable period of time. 

27Because of the unsettled home life, the schooling of the young person has been far from ideal. He attended a considerable number of schools over a relatively short period. According to the Report when the young person was in custody in 2009-2010 he did well at the Education and Training Unit within the relevant Institution. Since being back in custody the young person has again involved himself in courses. Ultimately he hopes to find employment in the building and construction industry. 

28The young person is engaged with an alcohol and other drugs counsellor. He now realises that his substance abuse and peer relations has greatly impacted on his offending behaviours. Of particular significance is that the young person has indicated a willingness to undertake a course of full time residential rehabilitation. 

29Realistically, the Report acknowledges that the court has little alternative to a custodial sentence, and recommends supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. 

Subjective Matters 

30The Court is also indebted to Mr Hemsley who has done and said everything that could be done and said to assist the young person. Initially it was put that I would allow the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. I have already dealt with this issue at the beginning of these remarks. 

31The young person has been in custody since 27 October 2010. The thrust of the submissions on behalf of the young person is that the eight months he has spent in custody should effectively be treated as the non-parole period and I should structure a sentence that has the effect of allowing the release of the young person to parole immediately. 

32In support of this proposition it was put that the young person since being in custody has undertaken education, and has now completed his Year 10 studies. There is apparently no longer a Certificate given to indicate the achievement of that milestone. Clearly enough, the young person has involved himself in education, and that can only assist him in the future. 

33Further, it was submitted that the young person has gained considerable insight into the effect that his substance abuse has had. In particular, he now realises that he needs to undertake a course of full time residential rehabilitation. I understood the submission was made on 21 June 2011 that there was a place available for the young person at the ""Peppers"" centre at Wagga Wagga. In that regard I have been favoured with a supplementary report from Mr Wilson of the Department of Juvenile Justice which indicates that there are no current placements available, that the young person has been placed on a waiting list and that the management of the Centre is unable to confirm when another placement would become available. 

34I observe that if the young person is successful in overcoming his addiction to illicit substances it will not only be in his interests but the interests of the broader community. I am prepared to find Special Circumstances because of the issue of rehabilitation. 

35Mr Hemsley also addressed to the effect that the principles relating to the sentencing of juvenile offenders favours rehabilitation over the other purposes of sentencing. I have also dealt with those issues earlier in these remarks. I remain firmly of the opinion that the emphasis normally given to rehabilitation should be moderated when dealing with this young person. 

Parity 

36The co offenders are adults and have yet to be dealt with by the District Court. Accordingly, I do not perceive any issue of parity. 

General Remarks 

37In the course of the sentence hearing on 21 June 2011 I raised with Mr Hemsley the possibility of committing this young person for sentence to the District Court. However, no application was made for that to occur. Both parties have proceeded on the basis that the Children's Court would deal with the matter. In these circumstances, I will leave the matter in the Children's Court. 

38It will be tolerably plain from what I have already said that I am very firmly of the view that it would be wholly inappropriate to deal with this matter other than by way of full time custodial sentence. While I accept that the offender is still a young person and that rehabilitation still weighs heavily in the sentencing process I cannot overlook the seriousness and multiplicity of the offending. 

39There are also the other minor matters on which I have to pass sentence. Giving due weight the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [17] and that line of authority, I am of the view that the other minor matters can be appropriately dealt with by wholly concurrent fixed terms of Control Order. I note that those sentences have long since expired. 

40Given that seriousness and multiplicity of offending, taking into account the matters on the Form 1 schedule I am of the firm view that the total sentence should be the jurisdictional limit of the Children's Court, that is, a Control Order of to years. It follows that I am of the opinion that the starting point before the application of the discount for the plea is well above the jurisdictional limit of the Children's Court. As previously indicated, I am prepared to find special circumstances, essentially because of the young person's indicated intention to undertake residential rehabilitation. It will be a condition of the parole that he obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service as to ongoing treatment and counselling for substance abuse. 

Formal Orders 

41Papers 2010/00357156

2HOEBEN J: 
Offences and sentence 
On 21 October 2010 the respondent pleaded guilty to the following offences: 

(i) One count of aggravated indecent assault of a child under the age of 10 years contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years with a standard non-parole period of 8 years. 

(ii) One count of use child under the age of 14 for pornographic purposes contrary to s91G(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. 

3The matter came before McLoughlin DCJ at the Port Macquarie District Court for sentencing on 2 March 2011. In respect of each offence his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 22 months and 15 days which pursuant to s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was wholly suspended. 

4The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed from these sentences pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the following grounds: 

Ground 1 - His Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost for the aggravated indecent assault offence. 

Ground 1B - His Honour was in error in finding that the offence of aggravated indecent assault was in the midway point between the bottom and the middle of the scale of objective serious. 

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in attaching so much importance to the payment of the mortgage of the complainant's house in determining to suspend the sentence. 

Ground 3 - His Honour erred in suspending the sentences. 

Ground 4 - The sentences were manifestly inadequate. 

Factual background 

5The victim at the time of these offences was 5 years of age and lived with her natural mother and the respondent. The victim's mother and the respondent were married, but the respondent was not her father. The victim had a twin sister A and a younger brother J, who was the respondent's natural son. The victim considered the respondent to be her father. The victim was developmentally delayed. 

6On the day of the offences, the respondent was in the master bedroom of the family home playing with a new camera and taking a photo of a lamp. The victim came into the bedroom wearing her school uniform and no underwear because she had wet herself. This was apparently not uncommon. The victim jumped onto the bed and made a pose for the respondent to take a photo of her. 

7The respondent took a photo of the victim with her bottom exposed. He then leant over the bed and with his fingers, spread her bottom cheeks apart exposing a full view of her anus and vagina. He then took another photo. 

8Shortly thereafter, the respondent deleted the two photographs from his camera. 

9The respondent's wife, the mother of the victim, was a freelance photographer. In June 2010 she inadvertently lost some photographs from a client which were held on a laptop computer. In order to retrieve the lost work photographs, she and the respondent purchased a recovery program. 

10In the course of retrieving those work photographs, the victim's mother came across the two photographs of the victim. She attempted to contact the respondent, but was unable to do so until he returned from work at about 2am on 17 June. When she confronted the respondent, he made a full admission to her and later that morning, attended the Port Macquarie Police Station and made admissions to police regarding the taking of the photographs of his stepdaughter. 

11It was common ground between the parties that the respondent had never transferred the photographs to the computer. They were, however, present on the memory card of the camera and appeared on the computer when the recovery program was implemented. 

Remarks on sentence 

12Having reviewed the facts, his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour noted that the offences involved serious breaches of trust in that the victim was the respondent's stepdaughter and was developmentally delayed. His Honour took into account as an aggravating factor the age of the victim. His Honour said: 

""If it were not for the age of the victim, her cognitive impairment and her relationship with the offender bringing with it a breach of trust because of her vulnerability, I would find the indecent assault at the bottom of any scale so constructed for such offences. 

However with the aggravating features to which I have referred I am of the view that both offences are in the midway point between the bottom and the middle of any scale so constructed."" (ROS 3.8) 

13His Honour went on to note that the standard non-parole period was a guide to which reference had to be made when sentencing. Because of their seriousness, he concluded that both offences must carry gaol sentences. 

14His Honour then considered the subjective case for the respondent. He was aged 25 at the time of the offences and 26 at the time of sentencing. He had no criminal convictions. Medical reports indicated that the respondent's IQ was low and in the order of 50-60. He had an older sibling and had been raised in a supporting and loving environment. At the time of sentencing he was separated from the mother of the victim to whom he had been married for 3 years. He was also separated from his 2 year old son and the twin stepdaughters, one of whom was the victim. As a result of his conduct the marriage appeared to be over. 

15The respondent was residing with his parents and was working as a tradesman/boiler maker. At the time of sentencing, the respondent was continuing to make the mortgage payments on the marital home. 

16The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He told the Court that he had no sexual attraction to children and could not explain his behaviour. He expressed his remorse and was deeply ashamed of his actions and the consequences they had brought on the family. He admitted taking the photographs but said that he had deleted them immediately from the digital camera. 

17Since he committed the offences, the respondent had been attending counselling from a mental health worker. He had also been referred to a psychiatrist. A Corrective Services psychologist had conducted tests of the respondent and concluded that he was in the low risk category relative to other male sex offenders. 

18The Corrective Services psychologist said that if the respondent received a custodial sentence he would be referred for participation in one of the treatment programs for sex offenders but that there was a wait list for access to low intensity treatment in custody and he might not be able to get access to or complete treatment before his release. 

19After his arrest, the respondent consulted a mental health social worker whom he saw on 16 occasions between 24 June and 20 October 2010. This mental health worker took a history of learning difficulties at school, the need for speech training and a bottling up of the respondent's feelings and need to communicate. The respondent presented with issues of stress, trauma and grief because of separation from his family. 

20The mental health worker said that the respondent was totally committed to the counselling process, had acknowledged the serious aspects of the incident and had accepted full responsibility for it. 

21The respondent commenced seeing a forensic psychologist in December 2010. This psychologist, who gave evidence in the sentence proceedings, recorded that the respondent was separated from his wife and children who were living in the family home. He recorded that the respondent was freely paying $500 per week towards the mortgage on the home and was also paying off a personal loan which had been used for renovations to the house. The psychologist estimated the respondent's intellectual capacity to be in the low average range. 

22The psychologist reached the following conclusions concerning the respondent: 

""It is my opinion that Mr K's presentation of a stable personality without noticeable psychopathological traits would suggest that he has the potential to receive benefit from a sexual offenders' treatment program and will not be confounded by any other negative personality issues. ... 

Mr K described his offending behaviour as he did in admissions to the police. Mr K said he deleted the photographs in the camera very soon after he had taken them because he said he had come to his senses in realising what he had done. He emphasised that he was so abhorred by what he had done that he deleted the photos from the SD card and the camera as soon as he realised his act. He did not download them to his computer. He did not attempt to minimise or deny his behaviour. He expressed profound emotional remorse for the offending behaviour on several occasions. He frequently welled up in tears that I took to be genuine. He was not able to explain how he came to commit the offence. He said his motivation for treatment was driven by his need to find the reason why he committed the offence. He said he had not contemplated any other similar offensive acts since that incident."" 

23The psychologist found that the respondent was not aware of the risk factors which led to his offence. He was struggling with understanding the reason why he sexually offended. He was aware that because he had offended, there remained the risk of re-offending. He told the psychologist about problems with stress, which he described as constantly striving to work hard. The psychologist was given a history of working intensely on nightshifts and taking on as much overtime as was offered. The respondent said that as a result of the offence he had become more aware of the stress that he was suffering from at the time. 

24The psychologist gave the following summary of his conclusions: 

""Continuing efforts to be financially responsible for his family. Consistently strong work ethic. Sufficiently intelligent to benefit from treatment and understand severity. Stable personality without psychopathological traits. Sense of conscience with any outside influence by his instant deletion of the material. No intention to sell, distribute or profit from the actions and a genuine profound remorse expressed and repeated."" 

The psychologist found that he had a low risk of re-offending. 

25The respondent saw another psychologist, who was accredited by the NSW Child Sex Offender Counsellor Accreditation Scheme (CSOCAS). That psychologist administered the MCMI-2 test which generates an adult personality profile. The results revealed the respondent to be hesitant and unsure of himself and to be experiencing quite high levels of anxiety. Psychological stressors were identified as the breakdown of the marriage, not seeing his children and pending court proceedings. In relation to the offence, the respondent denied any arousal or other heightened sexual feelings before taking the photos. 

26This psychologist set out a detailed treatment program. He recommended ""the treatment be provided by a counsellor with the necessary knowledge and skill to work with people who sexually offend against children"". 

27His Honour then returned to an analysis of the offence. His Honour accepted that there was no premeditation and that it occurred when the victim wandered into the bedroom. His Honour noted that as well as expressing remorse, the respondent had demonstrated genuine contrition by immediately reporting the matter to the police and entering a plea of guilty. His Honour also noted that through his work and continued payments, the respondent was benefiting the victim so that she was able to remain in her home without upheaval of a physical or psychological kind which can often accompany changes of houses. His Honour took into account the willingness which the respondent had demonstrated to not only seek treatment in the past, but to continue undergoing that treatment in the future. His Honour noted that there was no evidence before him of any psychological damage to the victim. 

28His Honour concluded that the principle of general deterrence would only be satisfied by a sentence of imprisonment. He considered that specific deterrence was not applicable, given the opinions of the psychologists and the treatment which the respondent was undertaking. In relation to the sentence, his Honour said: 

""Conviction on trial would in the view of this Court result in a sentence of some 2 years and 6 months imprisonment for each offence. 

In coming to that view I have regard to the goalpost set forth by the standard non-parole period. I have taken into account his plea of guilty as further evidence of contrition and as having public utility. I reduce that sentence by 25 percent in relation to both matters to 22 months imprisonment. As both offences were committed in tandem, as it were, one contributing to the other, in my view the sentences should be served concurrently. 

The Crown concedes that I should find special circumstances because of the rehabilitation that has been obtained, the first time in custody and the expected further rehabilitation that would occur and I find special circumstances."" 

29His Honour then considered whether it was appropriate in all the circumstances to suspend the sentence. His Honour said: 

""General deterrence requires a fulltime custody sentence. This must be tempered, in my view, with the continual security within the family which has been provided by the home for which the offender has paid the mortgage and the loan. The offender has the loss of family, the loss of love, the loss of emotional well being and if sentenced to fulltime custody, the success which has been obtained with his attendance on courses and the benefits to the family of his continuing to pay the mortgage. 

The offender it is understood to be with limited IQ, obtained maximum employment opportunities earning a considerable wage for which most of it or a large portion of it is spent upon the victim, his wife and children in the maintenance of the family home. In my view on probability as I have said, that would be lost should he be sent to fulltime custody. While that is not the sole determining factor it is a matter which I have taken into account with all of the other matters to which I have referred."" 



Appeal 
Ground 1 - His Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost for the aggravated indecent assault offence. 

Ground 1B - His Honour was in error in finding that the offence of aggravated indecent assault was in the midway point between the bottom and the middle of the scale of objective seriousness. 

30These two grounds are dealt with together since they essentially raise the same point. 

31The Crown put forward the following argument. It submitted that in relation to the aggravated indecent assault charge, the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 10 years with a standard non-parole period of 8 years. The Crown accepted that as a result of the respondent's plea of guilty, the standard non-parole period did not apply. Nevertheless, in accordance with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 the standard non-parole period had to be taken into account as a ""reference point"". The Crown submitted that the discrepancy between the sentence actually passed and the standard non-parole period was such that his Honour could not have followed the guidance in Way. 

32The Crown submitted that an explanation for his Honour's failure to properly consider the standard non-parole period was to be found in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the aggravated indecent assault offence. The Crown submitted that his Honour's start point for assessing the objective seriousness of the indecent assault offence at the bottom of the scale before taking into account aggravating features was patently wrong. While conceding that the assessment of objective seriousness in these circumstances was a discretionary finding, the Crown submitted that such an assessment paid so little regard to denunciation and general deterrence as to reveal error. 

33The Crown submitted that if the start point were wrong, it had affected his Honour's subsequent reasoning process to such an extent that error had occurred and this Court ought intervene to re-sentence. 

34The Crown submissions refer specifically to the aggravated indecent assault offence. I do not understand the Crown to be suggesting that insofar as the s91G(1)(a) offence was concerned, his Honour incorrectly characterised this as being at the bottom level of seriousness for offences of that kind. 

35As the Crown accepted, the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence involves a discretionary exercise on the part of the sentencing judge. In Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson J agreed, said: 

"" 30 Although expressed in terms which found their origin in the standard non-parole period statutory regime, which remained pertinent at least as a guidepost, her Honour was, in any event, required to assess the objective seriousness of the offence. As Simpson J has pointed out the difficult, indeed hypothetical, task of determining whether a particular offence falls in ""the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" differs little from the longstanding requirement to evaluate the objective seriousness of any offence which, as Her Honour has said, ""should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts"". (See R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 at [14](iii).) 

31 Furthermore, as Simpson J went on to say, relying on Way at [85]-[86]: 

""[14] (iv) Circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of an offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the mens rea of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence, (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness."" 

... 

37 Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably held to be so characterized."" 

36His Honour fully analysed the factual background to the offence. He set this out in considerable detail in his judgment. The Crown sought to challenge his Honour's initial assessment of the level of seriousness of the offence (before taking into account the aggravating features) by putting to the Court what it regarded as less serious offences than that which was before the Court. By way of example, the Crown referred to the touching of a young person on her clothing, but not on her skin. I do not find such an approach to be particularly helpful. What is important is the analysis of the actual facts of this case. 

37The essential feature of this offence was the touching of the victim on the buttocks. There was no touching of the genital area and in particular no touching of the vagina. Although the Crown's written submissions were to the contrary, this was conceded by the Crown in oral submissions. This is an important point of distinction between this offence and more serious offences of a similar kind where touching occurs. Given the fundamentally discretionary nature of this exercise, I have reached a conclusion similar to that of Spigelman CJ in Mulato , i.e. it was open to his Honour to assess the objective seriousness of the offence in the way in which he did, although I do so with some hesitation. 

38If his Honour's initial assessment of objective seriousness was open to him, I do not understand the Crown to challenge the three aggravating features which his Honour took into account and the way in which his Honour used those aggravating features, i.e. the age of the victim, his relationship with her and the fact that she was developmentally delayed. It follows, therefore, that his Honour's final assessment of objective seriousness as being midway between the bottom and the middle level of seriousness for offences of that kind was also open to him. 

39That finding as to objective seriousness is important when determining the use which was to be made of the standard non-parole period in the aggravated indecent assault offence. 

40It is not without significance that the standard non-parole period for this offence appears on its face to be out of step with the maximum penalty which the offence carries. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years, yet the standard non-parole period is 8 years. This surprisingly high ratio of 80 percent is not explained in the legislation and is different to the ratio between standard non-parole periods and maximum sentences in the other offences set out in the table to s54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In most offences on that table the ratio is less than 50 percent. Nevertheless, an 8 years non-parole period has been prescribed by the legislature and courts must give effect to it. 

41When considering this ground of appeal it is useful to set out what was actually said in Way about how standard non-parole periods are to be used in situations where they do not directly apply. The Court said: 


""122 In this approach the standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost, along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant. In particular, it can have a direct relevance as a reference point to be compared with the sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment has been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence, and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as any other subjective factor that may be present, including in particular the fact, if it be the case, that the offender entered a plea of guilty. In that regard the sentencing judge will need to keep in mind that the standard non-parole periods were framed upon the assumption that the case was determined at trial and that s 22 of the Act contemplates that the fact of a plea will attract a discount. 

... 

130 The approach which we favour is consistent with the disclosed legislative intention that Division 1A of Part 4 was to operate, not by way of any mandate or removal of sentencing discretion, but rather as providing a guidepost, or benchmark, against which the case at hand could be compared. That is not to say that it should be merely acknowledged in the passing. It takes its place alongside guideline judgments, and the prescribed maximum sentence for the relevant offence, which are to be taken into account in the same way that sentencing judges are required to take into account the provisions of s 21A, 22, 22A and 23, when exercising their sentencing discretion. 

131 What is not appropriate, in our view, is for a sentencing judge to commence the process for every offence (irrespective of its seriousness, and irrespective of whether the offender's guilt was established after trial or by a plea), at the standard non-parole period, and then to oscillate about it by reference to the aggravating and mitigating factors. The problem with that approach is that the standard non-parole period will tend to dominate the remainder of the exercise, thereby fettering the important discretion which has been preserved by the Act."" 

42The submission which the Crown puts forward, with its emphasis on the standard non-parole period, is very close to the approach which was disapproved in [131] of Way . What a sentencing judge has to do is to give appropriate weight to the standard non-parole period, together with the other factors which are identified. 

43That is what the sentencing judge did in this case. He was clearly conscious of the standard non-parole period and specifically referred to it on two occasions. This was not merely a cursory acknowledgment on his part, but it was clearly a matter to which he gave serious attention. His Honour also took into account the maximum penalty, the aggravating and mitigating factors and the respondent's very strong subjective case. He took into account the unusual features of this case, i.e. a brief period of aberrant behaviour with no apparent adverse effect on the victim. 

44I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non-parole period in this matter. These grounds of appeal have not been made out. 

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in attaching so much importance to the payment of the mortgage of the complainant's house in determining to suspend the sentence. 

45The Crown submitted that it was clear from his Honour's remarks that he placed excessive weight on this consideration. The Crown submitted that this approach involved error since the hardship was not of the ""exceptional"" kind specified in such cases as R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510. The Crown submitted that Edwards (Gleeson CJ, James and Ireland JJ) was authority for the proposition that only in highly exceptional circumstances should a court be influenced by the hardship that an otherwise justified prison term would cause to third parties. 

46The Crown submission does not accurately record what his Honour did. His Honour had already determined the term of the sentence and was considering whether the sentence thus determined should be suspended. His Honour was balancing the requirement that the sentence give effect to the principle of general deterrence against the benefits for the family, in particular the victim, the extra curial losses which the respondent had suffered and the detrimental effect incarceration would have on his rehabilitation. As well as those specific matters, his Honour took into account ""all the other matters to which I have referred"" (see [29] hereof). 

47I read that concluding remark to encompass all of the other considerations to which his Honour had specifically referred in his remarks on sentence up to that point. These included: 

(i) The very minimal risk of re-offending. 

(ii) The absence of criminal history. 

(iii) The respondent never having been in custody. 

(iv) The rehabilitation which had taken place and would continue in the future. 

(v) The spontaneous nature of the offence. 

(vi) The respondent having a stable personality without psychopathological traits. 

(vii) There being no evidence of any form of sexual deviancy or tendency towards paedophilia or perversion. 

(viii) The absence of major mental illness and substance abuse problems. 

(ix) The respondent's willingness to comply with the orders which prevented contact with his family and his respect for the supervisory authority of the Probation and Parole Service. 

(x) The apparent absence of harm to the victim. 

(xi) The genuine contrition of the respondent and his full co-operation with the police. 

These were all matters relevant to his Honour's decision. 

48Whilst the principle in Edwards is clear, the circumstances of this case are somewhat different. The distinguishing feature in this case is that the victim was one of the persons who would benefit from the respondent not being incarcerated and therefore being able to work. That additional factor enabled his Honour to properly take into account as a relevant consideration the benefits to the family, including the victim, of him being able to continue to work. 

49This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground 3 - His Honour erred in suspending the sentences. 
Ground 4 - The sentences were manifestly inadequate. 

50These grounds of appeal raise the same issues. 

51The Crown submitted that a sentence of 22 months, which was suspended, did not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. In support of that submission, the Crown emphasised the nature of the offence and the three aggravating features to which reference has already been made. By reference to those matters and general deterrence, the Crown submitted that a suspended sentence was outside the range of sentences which was open to his Honour within the proper exercise of his discretion. 

52In Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 85 ALJR 195 the plurality restated the principles relevant to grounds of appeal of this kind: 

""58 The single ground of appeal advanced by the Director in each appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was that the sentences imposed at first instance were manifestly inadequate. That is, the error which the Director asserted that the sentencing judge had made was of the last kind mentioned in House v The King . By asserting manifest inadequacy, the Director alleged that the result embodied in the sentencing judge's orders was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". The Director did not allege that any specific error could be identified (as would be the case if the sentencing judge were said to have acted upon wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, mistaken the facts or not taken into account some material considerations). Rather, the Director asserted that it was to be inferred from the result that there was ""a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance"". 

59 As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong , appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"". Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong , ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error"". 

53As the sentencing judge pointed out, the facts of this case were unusual. The offending while significant, was of a relatively low level, was spontaneous and to the extent possible, was remedied soon after the offence occurred, i.e. the two photographs were removed from the camera. When the offending was discovered, the respondent co-operated fully with the authorities and took genuine and extensive steps to rehabilitate himself and continues to do so. He has lost his marriage, his family and his home. There was minimal chance of re-offending, particularly if his rehabilitation was allowed to continue. 

54These were matters which his Honour took into account when assessing the objective level of seriousness of the offence and when determining the length of the sentence and how it would be served. In doing so, his Honour complied fully with the steps outlined by Howie J (with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed) in Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. 

55In that case Howie J said: 

""28 Once the term of the sentence has been determined the court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. The availability of an alternative to full-time custody will generally be governed by the length of the term that has been determined subject to the restrictions or pre-conditions imposed by the legislature on a particular sentencing alternative, see for example s 77 of the Act with respect to home detention. But the appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment: R v Jurisic at 250B. 

... 

31 As s 5 of the Act recognises, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is a grave step for a court to take whether or not the offender's liberty is immediately removed or curtailed. Section 5(2) requires a court, which imposes a sentence of imprisonment of 6 months or less, to indicate to the offender, and to record, its reasons for imposing such a sentence including the reasons why no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. These restrictions upon the power of a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment apply even if the sentence is suspended. A sentencing court, therefore, must recognise that a sentence of imprisonment can be a significant and effective punishment even where the execution of that sentence is suspended: JCE at [25], R v Foster at [36] where reference is made to statements to that effect in other jurisdictions. That is why, in the hierarchy of sentencing alternatives, a suspended sentence is considered as more severe than a community service order even though it may appear on its face to be less punitive. 

32 Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate."" 

56As already indicated, the findings by his Honour as to objective seriousness, as to the factual circumstances of the offence, as to rehabilitation and as to the subjective circumstances of the respondent were open to him. Those findings were such as to allow his Honour to conclude that notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence, a sentence of 22 months imprisonment was permissible. This sentence was, on his Honour's findings, within the range, albeit at the bottom of the range. This was a case in which the frequently quoted observations of King CJ in R v Osenkowski (1983) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213; (1982) 5 A Crim R 394 at 394 could legitimately be applied. 

57There King CJ said: 

""It is important that prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges. There must always be a place for the exercise of mercy where a judge's sympathies are reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case. There must always be a place for the leniency which has traditionally been extended even to offenders with bad records when the judge forms the view, almost intuitively in the case of experienced judges, that leniency at that particular stage of the offender's life might lead to reform. The proper role for prosecution appeals in my view, is to enable the courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime, to enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crime to be corrected, and occasionally to correct a sentence which is so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience."" 

58In the circumstances identified by his Honour, particularly the dedicated pursuit of rehabilitation and the respondent's subjective circumstances, his decision to suspend the sentence was not outside of the range of a proper exercise of his discretion. While in respect of this offence general deterrence remained of significance, in the particular circumstances of the case, that consideration did not require an actual period in custody. 

59These grounds of appeal have not been made out. 

60The order which I propose is that the appeal be dismissed. 

61GROVE AJ: I have had the opportunity to read the judgment of Hoeben J in draft form and I gratefully adopt, without need for repetition, his Honour's comprehensive analysis of the issues in this appeal. 

62It is a solemn duty of this Court to respond particularly in the interests of the protection of the very vulnerable. I would affirm what I said (McColl JA and Howie J agreeing) in Henry v R [2009] NSWCCA 69: 

"" This Court has always stressed that those who prey upon the innocence of young children will be met with retribution and personal deterrence as well as signalling to others who may be minded to so offend that condign punishment will follow such depredations."" 

63I have hesitated in coming to a conclusion about what I consider should be the outcome of this appeal especially having regard to the extent of departure from the guidance to be derived from the will of Parliament as expressed in the Standard Non Parole Period. 

64There are however some very unusual aspects in this case which powerfully point to mitigation of penalty being appropriate. Hoeben J has conveniently collated the considerations which were available to the sentencing Judge for that purpose. 

65Exceptional to the all too common experience of the Court where a child has been the subject of sexual interference, there was no multiplicity of acts but a single isolated instance. The actual contact was in a very low category of seriousness. Realisation of wrongdoing was virtually immediate as demonstrated by the deletion of pictures from the camera although technology does not, as events showed, permit ""deletion"" always to convey its ordinary meaning. 

66When the recovered pictures re-emerged, the admission by the respondent of what he had done was promptly forthcoming as was his reporting of himself to police. 

67Added to the other mitigating factors scheduled by Hoeben J, I regard the foregoing as principal considerations leading to a conclusion that the learned sentencing Judge's discretion did not miscarry. 

68I agree that the Crown appeal should be dismissed.

2757293,STATE OF NSW v BASTIAN [2011] NSWSC 641,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: 
Nature of proceedings 
The State of New South Wales (the State) by Amended Summons filed in Court with leave on 23 June 2011 applies for an extended supervision order for a period of 3 years in respect of the defendant pursuant to Part 2 of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act). 

2The original Summons was filed on 25 February 2011. On 21 March 2011 there was a preliminary hearing pursuant to s7(3) of the Act, at the conclusion of which Fullerton J made orders appointing two psychiatrists, Dr Anthony Samuels and Dr Andrew Ellis, to conduct examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Court. 

3Those examinations duly took place and a report by Dr Samuels dated 25 March 2011 and a report by Dr Ellis dated 18 April 2011 have been provided to the Court. 

4The defendant is currently subject to an interim supervision order that was made by Fullerton J on 21 March 2011 pursuant to s8(1) of the Act. That interim supervision order, which took effect on 10 April 2011, was renewed by Johnson J on 2 May 2011 and by Hidden J on 1 June 2011. The interim supervision order expires on 3 July 2011. 

5The final hearing in relation to the extended supervision order took place before me on 23 June 2011. The orders sought in the Amended Summons were not opposed by the defendant. At the conclusion of the hearing, I indicated that I was satisfied that it was appropriate to make an extended supervision order. These are my reasons. 

The evidence 
6In support of the application, the State relies upon four affidavits of Sarah Maria Johnson, affirmed 25 February 2011, 9 March 2011, 29 April 2011 and 8 June 2011. 

7The Attorney-General issued orders under s25 of the Act requiring various governmental agencies to produce documents relating to the defendant. Exhibited to the affidavit of Ms Johnson of 9 March 2011 and marked as exhibit ""SMJ-2"", is a folder of documents the contents of which were obtained from the agencies on which the s25 orders were served. 

8The affidavit of Ms Johnson of 8 June 2011 annexes entries which have been made on the data base maintained by Corrective Services NSW known as the ""Offender Information Management System"" since the last of the entries behind tab 88 of exhibit ""SMJ-2"". 

9The State also relies upon: 

(i) The reports of Dr Samuels and Dr Ellis. 
(ii) An affidavit of Zouhier Abedine, affirmed 9 June 2011. Mr Abedine is a Senior Compliance and Monitoring Officer with the Community Compliance and Monitoring Group (CCMG), the unit within Corrective Services NSW which is responsible for the management and supervision of high risk offenders in the community, and he has primary responsibility for the day to day case management of the defendant. 

(iii) An affidavit of Professor John Basson, affirmed 10 June 2011. Professor Basson is the Statewide Clinical Director of Forensic Mental Health, a division of Justice Health. His affidavit addresses information in Dr Ellis' report about the role of the Community Forensic Mental Health Service in relation to serious sex offenders. 

10On behalf of the defendant, an affidavit affirmed by him on 20 June 2011 was read. That affidavit indicated that he had worn an electronic monitoring device since his release on 10 April 2011. He had been attending a maintenance program at Surry Hills since 25 May 2011 which he said assisted him in identifying risks and in using strategies to prevent risks. He has undertaken not to use alcohol or drugs and tests conducted since his release have been negative. In essence, the affidavit provided evidence of compliance by the defendant with existing conditions and his intention to comply with similar conditions into the future. 

The statutory criteria 
11The primary object of the Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders to ensure the safety and protection of the community (s3(1)). Encouraging serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation is a further object of the Act (s3(2)). 

12An application for an extended supervision order may be made in respect of a ""sex offender"" who, at the time the application is made, is in custody in a correctional centre or who is under supervision for ""a serious sex offence"" or ""an offence of a sexual nature"" (s6(1)(a)). 

13The term ""serious sex offence"" is defined in s5(1) of the Act to include: 

(a) An offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 where: 

(i) In the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more, and 

(ii) In the case of an offence against an adult, the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation (within the meaning of the provision under which the offence arises). 

14The definition of ""offence of a sexual nature"" in s5(2) includes an offence under Division 10 of Part 3. (The distinguishing feature between a ""serious sexual offence"" and an ""offence of a sexual nature"" is the length of imprisonment for which an offence under Division 10 is punishable. If the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more, the offence is a ""serious sexual offence"", if it is punishable by imprisonment for less than 7 years, the offence is an ""offence of a sexual nature""). 

15A ""sex offender"" is defined in s4 to mean ""a person who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction of a serious sex offence, other than an offence committed while the person was a child"". A ""child"" is defined in the Act as ""a person who is under the age of 16 years"". The defendant meets the definition of a ""sex offender"" as he was sentenced to imprisonment in 2003, following his conviction for serious sex offences, within the meaning of s5(1) of the Act. 

16Section 9(2) of the Act, which was amended in December 2010, provides that an extended supervision order may be made ""if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision"". 

17Section 9(2A) of the Act provides that the Court ""is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence"". In State of NSW v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [94] Davies J interpreted this subsection to mean that it is unnecessary to find that it is more likely than not that an offender will commit a further serious sex offence if released without supervision before the conclusion can be reached that he poses an unacceptable risk. 

18Relevant to the application before me is s9(3) which provides: 

""((3) In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant 

(a) the safety of the community, 

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender's participation in any such examination, 

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender's participation in any such assessment, 

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, 

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community, 

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender's participation in any such programs, 

(f) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order, 

(g) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders prohibition Orders) Act 2004, 

(h) the offender's criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, 

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender, 

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature."" 

The section 9(3) factors in relation to the defendant. 
Section 9(3)(h) and 9(3)(h1): The defendant's criminal history and the view of the sentencing court 

19The defendant is aged 65. Apart from the sexual offences for which he has been convicted on three separate occasions, he has no other convictions recorded in New South Wales. 

20The chronology of the defendant's sexual offending history is set out in the table below: 





DATE 

CHARGES 

DETAILS OF CONVICTION AND SENTENCE 


Nov 1987 

One count of homosexual intercourse with male between 10 and 18 years, one count of sexual assault and one count of act of indecency by a person in authority (victim 10 years old). 

Pleaded guilty and convicted on 1 November 1988 on the third charge. Sentenced on 8 March 1989 to 3-year recognisance on paying bond of $3000, to accept supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 


Oct 1996 

Incite a male under the age of 18 years to commit an act of homosexual intercourse with a male person (victim 11 years old). 

On 23 July 1997, convicted and sentenced to a 3-year recognisance on payment of $2,000, and to accept supervision of Probation and Parole. 


Nov/Dec 2002 

4 counts of aggravated sexual assault victim aged 10-14 years, two counts of incite person under 16 years to commit indecent act. 
Form 1 inclusions: two counts of incite person under 16 years to commit act of indecency, one count of sexual intercourse with a person aged under 10 years, 22 counts of sexual intercourse with a person aged 10-14 years. 

Convicted and sentenced on 5 December 2003 to 8 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of six years. 

The 1987 offence 
21The defendant was charged with one count of homosexual intercourse with a male between 10 and 18 years, one count of sexual assault and one count of commit act of indecency, but was sentenced only in respect of a charge of indecent assault by a person in authority. 

22The offence was alleged to have occurred on 1 November 1987. According to the statement of facts, the defendant took a victim, who was 10 years and 10 months old at the time, to his home to assist him with moving some rocks. The defendant had become friendly with the victim's parents, who lived a few streets away. 

23The defendant and the victim became dirty moving the rocks, and they both had a shower, first the defendant and then the victim. As the victim was attempting to get dressed, the defendant made him lie down on the floor. The indecent assault consisted of the defendant playing with the victim's penis and putting it in his mouth. 

24On 9 March 1989 the defendant was placed on a recognisance under s558 of the Crimes Act for a period of 3 years on payment of $3000. A condition of the defendant's recognisance was that he place himself under the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and that he obey all reasonable directions of that service. The period of the defendant's recognisance expired on 13 March 1992 without him committing any offences. 

The 1996 offence 
25According to the statement of facts, on 25 October 1996 a number of handwritten notes were handed into the Moss Vale Police Station which contained sexually explicit material and identified a 12 year old boy. The victim was a ward of the State. He was interviewed by the police and said that on one occasion between 1 January 1995 and 28 March 1996 when he was living on the streets of Moss Vale, the defendant had approached him in a park and offered him money in return for sex. 

26The victim said that on a further occasion between 28 March 1996 and 12 November 1996, by which time the victim was in foster care, the defendant had approached him outside a supermarket and again offered him money in return for sex. 

27The defendant was charged with two counts of inciting an act of gross indecency, but was ultimately convicted of inciting a male person under the age of 18 years to commit an act of homosexual intercourse. He was convicted and sentenced on 23 July 1997 to a 3 year recognisance on payment of $2000. The conditions of the bond included that he accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and that he attend for assessment and counselling as directed by the Service. The defendant appears to have been compliant with the directions of the Service and supervision was terminated early with effect from 28 May 1999. 

The 2002 offences 
28The defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing six counts relating to the period between 1 November and 31 December 2002. 

(i) Incite RW, a person under the age of 16 years, namely 12 years, to an act of indecency with him. 

(ii) Incite NF, a person under the age of 16 years, namely 12 years, to an act of indecency with him. 

(iii) Two counts of sexual intercourse with RW. 

(iv) Two counts of sexual intercourse with NF. 

29In addition, there were 25 counts included on a Form 1 which the sentencing judge described as follows: 

""Not only are there charges listed in that form relating to NF and RW but there are also charges in relation to two other children, one boy TW, and a girl CW. The children are not related to the offender. The form includes 22 further offences of having sexual intercourse with RW and/or NF and two offences of inciting TW to an act of indecency with the offender and one offence of inciting CW to an act of indecency with the offender. TW was only five years old at the time of the offences. CW was also five years old at the time of the offence."" 

30The offences took place in Goulburn. The sentencing judge set out the full facts of the offences: 

(i) In about November 2002 RW and NF met the defendant at a Goulburn service station. He invited them back to his residence to look at pornographic magazines. They accompanied him and viewed some magazines in the defendant's lounge-room. He asked them to show him their penises which they did (counts 1 and 2 in the indictment). 

(ii) RW then accompanied the defendant into his bedroom. Soon after NF was called into the room by RW where he saw RW lying on the bed with the defendant sucking his penis (count 3 in the indictment). 

(iii) NF was enticed by the defendant to lie on the bed and when he did, the defendant started to suck his penis (count 4 in the indictment). 

(iv) At the same time RW placed his penis inside the defendant's anus and had sexual intercourse with him (count 5 in the indictment). 

(v) Both boys then left the premises but returned by arrangement later that day. Again both boys went into the defendant's bedroom and the defendant sucked RW's penis; at the same time NF put his penis inside the defendant's anus and had sexual intercourse with him (count 6). 

(vi) Both boys ejaculated following which NF lay on the bed and the defendant sucked his penis and at the same time RW placed his penis inside the defendant's anus and had sexual intercourse with him (some of the offences on the Form 1). 

31According to the facts sheet, up to this point the defendant had promised the boys money and mobile phones. The boys returned to the defendant's home the following day, then the following Thursday and Saturday and similar events as recounted above occurred which were included in the Form 1. On the Sunday when the boys attended the defendant's home, there were two other children in attendance, TW and CW. The defendant sent them outside while he performed oral intercourse on both NF and RW. On another day during the relevant period when NF and RW attended the defendant's premises, a co-offender was present. Both men performed sexual acts on NF and RW. The offences came to light when the mother of TW and CW found notes from the defendant containing sexually explicit material. 

32The sentencing judge found that although the sexual intercourse involved with the children was not the most intrusive kind, the age of the victims was towards the bottom of the age range and accordingly the offences were towards the upper end of seriousness. His Honour said: 

""In this case the facts demonstrate predatory conduct on behalf of the offender. He lured the boys into taking part in this conduct. They were at an age when they were very vulnerable and it is likely that the offender's behaviour will have serious repercussions with regard to their development. Moreover, on one occasion he introduced another adult into the sexual behaviour. This is a very serious aggravating factor in the offences."" 

33On the indecency counts, his Honour sentenced the defendant to a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to commence 11 April 2003. In relation to the two offences of sexual intercourse involving NF, his Honour sentenced the defendant to 4 years imprisonment to commence 11 April 2003 and expire on 10 April 2007. In relation to the two offences of sexual intercourse involving RW and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, his Honour sentenced the defendant to 7 years imprisonment to commence on 11 April 2004 and expire on 10 April 2011 with a non-parole period of 5 years to expire on 10 April 2009. The total sentence was imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

The pattern of the offending behaviour disclosed by the defendant's criminal history. 

34In his Risk Assessment Report in relation to the defendant, dated 21 January 2011, Mr Patrick Sheehan, a psychologist with Corrective Services NSW gave the following overview of the defendant's offending conduct: 

""Mr Bastian is convicted of sexual offences against children aged between 5 and 12 years occurring from 1987 and 2002. The majority of victims were male and known to Mr Bastian, however, the index offences suggest that no prior relationship had been established with the two male 12 year old victims. The offences range from making verbal sexual propositions performing oral sex on the victims and having the victims penetrate Mr Bastian anally. There was no suggestion of violence or threats towards any of the victims. A common theme has been the offer of inducements to obtain the victims' compliance. The offences in 1996 and 2003 were temporally associated with Mr Bastian writing sexually explicit material focusing on the victim."" 

In his Risk Assessment Report Mr Sheehan described the defendant's history as escalating in intrusiveness over time and involving psychological coercion of his victims. 

35In his report of 25 March 2011 Dr Samuels said: 

""An anamnestic review of Mr Bastian's offending suggests that a pattern of approaching and grooming young males aged between 10 and 16, writing to them in a sexually explicit manner, making inducements; financial and otherwise, and attempting to psychologically coerce them into sexual activity. He has gained access to most of his victims through forming relationships with their parents or care givers and, at times, he has been placed in positions of trust over them. 

It does seem that at times alcohol abuse has been a factor in the offending behaviour."" 

Custodial history 
36The defendant has a ""mixed history"" of institutional adjustment. He incurred sanctions for smoking in a non-smoking area, intimidation, possess prohibited goods, disobey direction, possess/create prohibited goods and make mischievous complaint. The defendant had also, in the words of Mr Sheehan, ""drawn adverse attention to himself by collecting inappropriate material in his cell and habitually approaching young offenders for sex"". The material confiscated from his cell ranged from entirely appropriate ""self help"" or ""men's health"" material to other material that was clearly used to stimulate deviant sexual fantasies regarding children. 

Section 9(3)(b): The reports received from the persons appointed to conduct psychiatric examinations of the offender. 

Report of Dr Anthony Samuels 
37Dr Samuels conducted an interview with the defendant on 25 March 2011 when he was still in custody. The defendant told him that although he had a few sexual relationships with women until his mid thirties, it was now quite clear that he was homosexual. He said that his last sexual relationship in custody was in 2010. On his release he did not intend to associate with anyone under the age of 10, but he wanted to find someone his own age to associate with. The defendant acknowledged that he used to have an interest in boys aged 10 and upwards, but that things had changed stating ""I do not want anyone under the age of twenty one to be a friend, near me or around me"". 

38In responding to the question of whether the defendant posed a risk of committing a further serious sex offence if he were not kept under supervision, Dr Samuels said: 

""Taking into account actuarial risk factors, dynamic risk factors, acute dynamic risk factors, structured professional clinical judgment, anamnestic risk review and the clinical psychiatric examination that I conducted today, I do believe that Mr Bastian does pose a risk of committing a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision."" 

39In forming this opinion Dr Samuels: 

(i) Referred to the pattern of offending disclosed by the offending history. 

(ii) Considered that the defendant minimised some aspects of his offending behaviour and noted that there had been a number of complaints that had never led to charges or convictions. 

(iii) Observed that the defendant felt that he was getting some benefit from an SSRI anti-depressant, that he reported no longer getting erections and that he had less fantasies about children in addition to which he said he had a number of strategies in place to prevent him being in situations of risk. 

(iv) Noted that the defendant said he now had an established sexual identity and that he planned to seek relationships with older men and that he intended to continue attending the Maintenance Program, comply with the conditions of an extended supervision order and, in particular, would avoid alcohol abuse. 

(v) Considered that although the defendant gave a history of having been exposed to traumatic experiences in childhood, the veracity of the information he provided to date was ""questionable"", noting that the account the defendant had given to him was different from that which he gave to Dr Allnutt when the latter prepared a pre-sentence report. 

(vi) Noted that there was some evidence of the defendant having some personal instability and a documented history of self-harming behaviour in the past, as well as a prolonged psychiatric admission. 

40On the positive side, Dr Samuels referred to the taking of the SSRI medication, which might have some protective benefits, and his completion of the Custody Based Intensive Treatment Program (CUBIT). 

41In relation to the nature of his risk, Dr Samuels said: 

""I would see Mr Bastian's risk as being an ongoing risk and I think it would be reasonable for the Orders to be in place for a five year period. However, I am aware that his physical health is poor, that he is 65 years old and it is quite possible that his physical health could change in the course of the next five years and some of the Orders that are currently in place may no longer be necessary or might become redundant."" 

Report of Dr Ellis 
42Dr Ellis conducted a clinical examination of the defendant on 1 April 2011 when he was still in custody. As with Dr Samuels, the defendant stated that he now identified as homosexual and that he had done so since attending CUBIT. He said that for most of his life he had been confused about his sexual orientation but he was now attracted to men past middle age. 

43Dr Ellis opined that the defendant ""would meet the diagnostic criteria for paedophilia, primarily attracted to males, possibly exclusive"". 

""This is evidenced by offences spanning three decades indicating sexual behaviour with prepubescent boys, his self report of fantasy and urges towards this age group over his life and behaviours while in custody such as collecting pictures of young boys while engaged in a sex offender program. His ability to sustain a sexual relationship with an age-appropriate adult has yet to be tested. Paedophilia is commonly a chronic and relapsing condition."" 

44In relation to psychological stressors, Dr Ellis noted that the defendant was isolated from significant personal supports and was wholly reliant upon the support of professionals or a criminal peer group. Insofar as his functioning was concerned, Dr Ellis noted that it was adequate in his current environment but that he continued to engage in immature interactions with others and would require significant support in the community in order to achieve a similar level of function. 

45On the issue of the risk of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence, Dr Ellis considered the actuarial and clinical parameters and expressed the view that without any treatment or supervision ""Mr Bastian would fall into a group of persons with a risk of offending that is moderately high, and greater than a theoretical average offender"". 

46In reaching this opinion, Dr Ellis said: 

""Deviant sexual arousal is consistently identified as the most prominent risk factor for sexual re-offence. Mr Bastian presents with a clear pattern of paraphilic sexual arousal. This arousal is directly related to the types of offences previously committed. This factor is somewhat controlled by prescription of SSRI medication. Of concern is masturbatory activity that continues to fantasy of previous offences and his own childhood sexual abuse, which mirrors his own offending behaviour. Should the prescription of this medication continue, then this particular contributing factor would be less salient. With advancing age, sexual drive may diminish. In this particular case deviant sexual arousal continues, despite age. It is of benefit that he is able to describe his arousal pattern and therefore would be able to alert professionals if it was worsening."" 

47Dr Ellis referred to the defendant's completion of CUBIT albeit ""not without difficulty"" and accompanied by prior unsuccessful attempts at treatment. 

""Persons who complete such programs are in a group that demonstrates lowering rates of recidivism. His most recent attempt at treatment has yielded more positive, but still equivocal reports from his treating clinicians. Studies show that persons who reinforce gains made in custodial programs with ongoing work in the community, may display lower rates of recidivism. It is not clear whether this is an effect of treatment itself or that persons who complete treatment tend to have more control over their behaviour, than those who do not. He has continued to collect banned material post his institutional treatment completion."" 

48In relation to the proposed conditions, Dr Ellis noted that the defendant did not identify any difficulties in complying with the conditions ""and in fact welcomed them"". Dr Ellis considered that it would benefit the defendant to have a period of time to acquire stable accommodation, to practise skills learned in group programs and to have assistance in obtaining employment or suitable social networks. He also supported the condition of abstinence from alcohol. 

49In relation to the duration of any order, Dr Ellis suggested that a period of three years would enable the defendant's baseline function in the community to be established, along with a refinement of the appraisal of his risk. Dr Ellis divided the three years into three twelve month periods: 

""It is most likely that a period of 12 months will be required to secure stable accommodation and regular meaningful activity in the community, given the restrictions on persons subject to extended supervision orders. During this period of time, it is unlikely that a person will have the focus to benefit from intense therapeutic activity. A further 12 months of regular treatment in a psychological program, coupled with medications and review of this medication would be necessary to consolidate gains in custodial programs or to establish that these programs are ineffective. A further period of 12 months would be required to monitor the consolidation. At this point a more informed appraisal of future risk in progress could be made ... 

Although paedophilia is a chronic condition, which will likely last beyond a period of 3 years, given the age of Mr Bastian, with the attendant general reduction in risk associated, his previous apparent treatment progress, possible deterioration in physical health over the period, the period of time required to observe behaviour is less than a younger person with a similar condition, who had not previously completed custodial treatment."" 

Section 9(3)(d): The results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence. 

50In his Risk Assessment Report, Mr Sheehan assessed the defendant's risk of sexual re-offending using the Static-99R Test. Mr Sheehan scored the defendant at 4 which placed him in the moderate-high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders. 

51As Mr Sheehan observed in his Risk Assessment Report, because it measures static risks, the Static-99R instrument is not sensitive to changes in an offender's circumstances that may increase or decrease his actual risk of re-offending. There were aspects of the defendant's offending history and rehabilitative progress which were of concern to Mr Sheehan in this regard. 

Section 9(3)(c): the results of any other assessment prepared by a ... registered psychologist ... as to the likelihood of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence. 

52Mr Sheehan conducted an interview with the defendant for the purpose of preparing his Risk Assessment Report. In the executive summary, Mr Sheehan said: 

""Mr Bastian is a 65 year old male with a known history of sexual offending against six children aged between 5 and 12 years. He has been convicted of sexual offences on three separate occasions over 14 years. Whilst most of his victims are male, his index offending does include a female victim. He incurred his first conviction for sexual offending when he was aged 41 years and committed his most recent offence when he was aged 54. Mr Bastian has completed an intensive Sex Offender Treatment Program in 2010. He is assessed as a high risk of sexually re-offending relative to other male sex offenders. He has a deviant sexual interest in pre-pubescent male children between the ages of 5 and 13 years and remains highly sexually motivated."" 

53In terms of his risk, Mr Sheehan observed that the defendant had acknowledged an enduring and intense sexual interest in children and that he was likely to experience further sexual attraction should he come into contact with them. Applying the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol, the defendant exhibited risk factors in all five domains, namely, sexual violence, psychological adjustment, mental disorder, social adjustment and manageability. In respect of the latter, Mr Sheehan observed that the defendant had exhibited problems with planning, problems benefiting from treatment and problems responding to supervision while in CUBIT. 

54Mr Sheehan considered that substance abuse, victim access, hostility, emotional collapse, the collapse of social supports and rejection of supervision were acute dynamic risk factors in the defendant's case. Although the defendant's history did not suggest he would sexually act out on every occasion that the above features coincided, Mr Sheehan considered that the risk was chronic ""in that over time as he was exposed to these risk factors without intervention or interruption there would be less impediments to a sexual offence should the defendant find himself in such situations."" Mr Sheehan concluded that notwithstanding his treatment he remained a man with a paraphilic interest towards children who had remained unusually sexually motivated into later life and had continued to exhibit behaviour directly and indirectly associated with elevated risk during and after participation in an intensive sex offender treatment program."" 

Section 9(3)(e): Any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the defendant has had an opportunity to participate. 

55The defendant recommenced the CUBIT program on 9 March 2009. In her report Ms Donaldson, psychologist, described his overall participation as ""mixed"": 

""Mr Bastian generally appeared to have difficulty intellectually understanding treatment concepts and demonstrated poor insight into his own thought processes and emotion. For example, he had difficulty identifying his own thoughts and how he could challenge or change unhelpful thinking; and difficulty identifying a range of emotions he was experiencing. He was able to identify a number of factors that were unhelpful in his life (e.g. poor coping, sexual interest in children); however, Mr Bastian appeared hesitant to change these. Whilst he verbalised his eagerness to complete the CUBIT program and implement change in his life, this was not routinely reflected in his behaviour."" 

56In terms of his behaviour in the CUBIT community Ms Donaldson described it as varying throughout his participation: 

""He spent most of his time in his cell isolated from others; however appeared to have a small group of community members that he regularly interacted with. Despite this, Mr Bastian received a number of warnings of institutional misconducts and was placed on a Behaviour Management Contract for engaging in unhelpful or inappropriate behaviours. An ongoing problem for Mr Bastian was his tendency to create sexually explicit and pornographic writing and drawings, collect newspaper articles (related to sexual offenders or other high profile offenders), advertisements featuring children and medical or educational information of a sexual nature."" 

57Ms Donaldson recommended that his reintegration into the community be both supportive and structured; she considered that he would benefit from a period of supervision under Probation and Parole and recommended that during that period, he attend a Community Based Maintenance Program at Forensic Psychology Services. 

Section 9(3)(f): The level of the defendant's compliance with any obligations to which he has been subject while on release on parole. 

58Although the defendant was eligible for parole on 10 April 2009, his parole was refused. Probation and Parole did not recommend parole on the basis that the defendant had not successfully completed CUBIT. When it was considered again in 2010, the defendant had still not completed CUBIT and even when participating in the program he exhibited some ""highly concerning behaviours"", referring to the institutional charges relating to the possession of pornographic literature, pictures of children and other sexually explicit material. 

Section 9(3)(g): Level of the defendant's compliance with any obligations under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004. 

59The defendant has only been subject to this legislation since the commission of the index offences. Since his release from custody there is no indication that the defendant has been anything other than compliant with the obligations in the Offenders Registration Act . 

Section 9(3)(a): The safety of the community 

60The safety of the community is the primary object of the Act. The defendant's criminal history indicates a pattern of offending against males between the ages of 10 and 12 with his index offences, including offences committed against a younger male child and a younger female child. Although he did not use physical coercion on his victims, the defendant did engage in psychological coercion offering his victims money and, in the case of the index offences, mobile phones in exchange for sex. The index offences appear to indicate an escalation in terms of the seriousness of his offending behaviour. 

61Mr Sheehan's Risk Assessment Report indicates that although the defendant does not fall in the high risk category of sexual offending in terms of his static risk factors, he remains in the high risk category of sexual offending. He meets the diagnostic criteria for paedophilia and has personality traits which expose him to risk, such as his low self esteem and his need to seek approval from others, his sense of entitlement and his hyper-vigilance to rejection. Dr Ellis concurs in this diagnosis. Both he and Dr Samuels consider that the defendant presents a risk of committing further sex offences if he were to be released without supervision. 

62Notwithstanding his period of imprisonment and participation in an intensive sex offender treatment program, the defendant continues to display attitudes and behaviour that are of concern in terms of the risk of his re-offending. His participation in CUBIT on the second occasion was an improvement on the first occasion but he continued to externalise responsibility for his offending behaviour and his therapists found it difficult to assess whether his motivation to change the range of unhelpful behaviours he identified as contributing to the risk of re-offending, was genuine. The defendant has continued to exhibit problematic behaviours, both during his time in CUBIT and afterwards. Psychologists and others who have assessed him consider that for his age, the defendant displays a high libido. 

Consideration 
Duration of the order 
63Dr Ellis considers that an order of three years would enable the defendant's baseline function to be established and to refine the appraisal of risk. In expressing that opinion Dr Ellis relies on the defendant's age and attendant reduction in risk associated with that. Dr Samuels considers an order for five years to be appropriate but notes that it is possible that the defendant's physical health status will change in that period in which event some of the conditions might no longer be necessary. 

64As both the psychiatrists acknowledge, the defendant's risk is chronic. Notwithstanding his age, his libido is high and he continues to fantasise about young boys. In light of the evidence of the court appointed psychiatrists as to his physical health, the State now seeks an order for extended supervision of 3 years. 

65I am satisfied that an order of 3 years would facilitate monitoring and review of the defendant's risk as suggested by Dr Ellis. There is then a further 6 months period for review and consolidation or, if necessary, a further application under the Act. 

Should an order be made? 
66On the basis of the above material, the fundamental question for the Court is whether it is ""satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision"". 

67The meaning of ""high degree of probability"" is reasonably well settled. It has been interpreted as imposing ""an elevated standard of proof which is lower than the criminal standard but higher than the civil standard"" ( Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 420 at [34]; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [5] and [18], Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 605 at [27].) 

68The meaning of ""unacceptable risk of committing a further serious sex offence"" is less settled. In introducing the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Bill 2010, pursuant to which the amendments to the test in sections 9 and 17 were made, the Attorney-General for NSW referred to a review of the Act which had been conducted by the Sentencing Council. In the course of that review many stakeholders acknowledged difficulties with the word ""likely"" in the previous formulation of the test and called for clarification. Referring to the fact that the ""unacceptable risk"" test had been adopted in Victoria and in Queensland, the Attorney stated that it was appropriate to adopt a similar test. 

69The term ""unacceptable risk"" has not been defined in the Act, nor has it been defined in the equivalent legislation of the other jurisdictions. 

70In State of New South Wales v Richardson Davies J (at [28]) referred to two decisions of the Western Australian Court of Appeal on that State's equivalent legislation. In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] 176 A Crim R 110, Wheeler JA said: 

""63 In my view, an ""unacceptable risk"" in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention."" 

71The other decision to which his Honour referred was Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] 198 A Crim R 149 where Steytler P and Buss JA said: 

""27 The word ""unacceptable"" necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, to the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). As John Fogarty points out, albeit in a rather different context ( Unacceptable risk - A return to basics (2006) 20 AJFL 249 at 252), the advantage of the phrase ""unacceptable risk"" is that ""it is calibrated to the nature and degree of the risk, so that it can be adapted to the particular case"". 

72By reference to those two cases, Davies J said this about applying the test: 

""90 Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"". The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. That is also because s 17(3) provides for the further assessment that if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk a supervision order will not be adequate to meet the risk. "" 

73While his Honour was considering the provisions of s17(3), his analysis is equally appropriate to s9(2) of the Act. His Honour's approach involves an appropriate application of the reasoning of the Western Australian Court of Appeal and I gratefully adopt it. 

74When one carries out the balancing exercise, the evidence is all one way that an extended supervision order is required. That being so, I have no difficulty being satisfied ""to a high degree of probability"" that such an order should be made. 

Orders 
(1) As of the date of making this order I revoke the Interim orders previously made by Fullerton, Johnson and Hidden JJ. 

(2) I make an order pursuant to s9(1)(a) of the Act that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order for a period of 3 years and 6 months and pursuant to s11 of the Act, I direct that the defendant comply with the following conditions: 

Reporting and monitoring 
1. During the period of the extended supervision order the defendant must accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and the CCMG for as long as necessary as determined by the Departmental Supervising Officer. 

2. During the period of the extended supervision order the defendant must accept the supervision and guidance of the Child Protection Watch Team for as long as necessary as determined by that Team. 

3. The defendant must comply with any reasonable direction given by the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other departmental officer who may from time to time be involved in supervision of the defendant. 

4. For at least the first 6 months from the date of this order, the defendant must wear electronic monitoring equipment if and as directed by the Departmental Supervising Officer and must comply with all instructions given by officers of the Department in relation to the operation of such equipment. The defendant must not tamper with or remove such equipment. At the end of 6 months the Departmental Supervising Officer must review this condition and must, following such review, not unreasonably refuse to discontinue the use of the electronic monitoring equipment. 

5. Unless and until he is directed otherwise by the Departmental Supervising Officer, the defendant must inform the Departmental Supervising Officer of his proposed daily movements 48 hours in advance by providing a schedule in writing (or as otherwise directed by the Departmental supervising officer) and must obtain prior approval from the Departmental supervising officer for any proposed change. 

6. Condition 5 does not apply if the defendant requires urgent medical attention and he is either unable to inform the Departmental Supervising Officer of his proposed movements in advance or is unable to obtain prior approval from the Departmental Supervising Officer for any proposed change in advance. 

Accommodation 
7. For the duration of the extended supervision order the defendant must reside at such accommodation as is approved in advance by the Departmental Supervising Officer. 

8. The defendant must accept home visits at the approved accommodation, including visits without prior notice, by the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other departmental officer. 

9. For 12 months from the date of this order, the defendant must be at his address between the hours of 9 pm and 6 am the following morning, unless his presence at another place during those hours has been approved in advance by the Departmental Supervising Officer. 

10. Condition 9 does not apply if the defendant is residing at a Community Offender Support-Program Centre (""COSP""). The accommodation conditions applicable to the COSP, including the hours when the defendant must be at the COSP, will apply in that situation unless his presence at another place during those hours has been approved in advance by the Departmental Supervising Officer. 

11. The defendant must not leave New South Wales without the prior written permission of the Commissioner or his delegate.

13. The defendant must agree that, if the Department Supervising Officer considers it appropriate to do so, the Departmental Supervising Officer may provide to any prospective or actual employer of the defendant information relating to the defendant's criminal history and may notify such prospective or actual employer that the defendant is subject to a supervision order and of the terms of the order.

21. The defendant must not approach or have any contact with any children 16 years of age or under at any sporting facility, sporting venue or public swimming pool. 

Further matters 
22. Should the defendant propose to enter into a relationship with another person, be that relationship at an intimate level or at the level of friendship, whom he knows, or comes to know, is the parent or guardian (or otherwise a person with care or control, such as a teacher) of a child 16 years of age or under, he must notify the Departmental Supervising Officer as soon as reasonably practicable. The Departmental Supervising Officer may disclose the defendant's offence history to such other person if the Officer is satisfied that to do so is necessary or desirable in the interests of the safety of any children of or related to that person, or otherwise within their care or control.

30. Without limiting the preceding paragraph, if it is prescribed the defendant must accept medical treatment or any other therapy as may be provided by CFMHS, Justice Health, and LHD or any medical practitioner, and must not unreasonably refuse his consent to the administering of such prescribed drug or therapy. 

Disclosure of information 
31. The defendant must waive his right to the confidentiality of all information disclosed by him during treatment to his doctors, including any psychiatrist or other specialist and any psychologist. 

32. The defendant must consent to his general practitioner, any other medical practitioner, his treating psychologists or psychiatrists, any treating LHD, CFMHS and Justice Health sharing information about him, including reports on his progress and information he has disclosed during treatment with each other and with the Departmental Supervising Officer and other departmental officers involved in his supervision.

		30 June 2011",2011-06-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757298,R v STEVENS [2011] NSWDC 81,"Judgment 



1HIS HONOUR: When this matter was called on for trial, the Crown advised me that a pre-trial issue needed to be determined concerning the admissibility of what the Crown accepts is tendency evidence. It was agreed between the Crown and Ms Moen, who appears for the accused, that the way that I would determine this matter would be to read various documents, including the statement of the complainant in this matter and the statement of a different complainant, and then decide the various issues that need to be determined under the Evidence Act based on that written material. 

2The accused faces trial on an indictment containing a number of counts of sexual assault. They are all alleged to have occurred at the one time on the one complainant. Her evidence, the Crown expects to be, will be that she went out to a nightclub one evening with a friend. She and the friend got separated and the next thing the complainant knows is that she is naked in bed with a complete stranger who is performing sexual acts upon her. She will say that she then leaves and goes back to the backpacker's hostel where she was staying. She was a tourist whose first reaction was simply to leave the country but, before doing so, and on reflection, she complained to the police who carried out a number of investigations. 

3In particular, they arranged for a medical examination which revealed the presence of semen in the complainant's vagina. Some months after the complainant returned home to Denmark, a match was made between the DNA recovered from the complainant's vagina and DNA relating to an earlier matter involving this accused. He faced trial for this earlier matter and was convicted by a jury on one count which involved the digital penetration of the complainant in that matter. Her evidence was that after a fight with her boyfriend left her alone in the city with no money and no phone - at least not one that worked - she was befriended by the accused who took her back to an office to which he had access, gave her some red wine to drink, she then fell asleep and was woken by sexual activity. 

4The Crown wishes to call evidence in this trial from the earlier complainant, arguing that it establishes a tendency on the part of the accused to act in a particular way and, as specified in the tendency notice, that particular way being: 

""to act in a sexually opportunistic and/or predatory way in relation to young, intoxicated women and removing the young, intoxicated women from a public place to a private place under which he has control and then sexual assaulting the women"". 

5The Crown says that that evidence has significant probative value. Ms Moen, for the accused, says it does not. In assessing the probative value of the evidence, it is important to identify the relevant fact in issue. In this case, Ms Moen, on behalf of the accused, has made an admission which removes the question of identity from being a relevant matter in dispute. The fact in issue, as particularised by the Crown on this application, is whether the complainant consented to what the accused did and, if she did not consent, whether he was aware that she was not consenting. 

6The Crown particularised thirteen separate points of similarity between the circumstances arising in this case and the circumstances arising in the earlier case. When a judge looks at such a list, it is important to exercise care for two particular reasons. 

7It is important to be cautious firstly because often what are said to be multiple points of similarity are often really only one point of similarity. The second reason for caution is that sometimes there is a limited number of ways in which an offence can be committed and similarities are often due to that circumstance rather than showing any particular tendency or coincidence. 

8Let me illustrate what I mean. Judges are sometimes told by the person seeking to adduce the evidence, possibly in a table they have prepared, that there are many points of similarity between the facts of the alleged offence and the facts in the tendency evidence. Take a case where a person is alleged to have robbed a bank wearing a stocking over his face and the Crown wants to adduce evidence of another occasion where the accused did precisely that - wore a stocking while robbing a bank. It is possible to list the similarities between the two as these: 










the robber disguised his appearance

the robber wore a stocking
But in truth they are not two points of similarity but one. 

9The other problem can be illustrated by a case where the prosecution relies on a similarity which is a common way of committing a crime. For example if the evidence at trial suggested that the person robbing the bank demanded money it is hardly significant that something similar happened in another bank robbery. 

10Both these points can be illustrated in R v O'Keefe [2009] NSWCCA 121 where the Crown alleged that a particular accused committed a number of sexual assaults on different women who were out jogging. It relied on the circumstance that the assaults all took place in a secluded place, and that they took place in bushland. That is in effect saying the same thing twice (the first reason for caution) and it is not all surprising that a person would commit an offence of that nature in a location where there were unlikely to be witnesses (the second reason). 

11With that preliminary matter out of the way, let me list the matters relied on by the Crown and make some comments about them. 

12First, the Crown relies on the age of the complainants. The complainant in the first matter was eighteen and in the second matter nineteen. That is a point of similarity but the question is ultimately whether it, together with the other points of similarity is significantly probative. 

13The second aspect relied on by the Crown is that reasonably shortly before sexual activity took place with a stranger, both complainants were alone in the city, the first complainant, after fighting with her boyfriend and the second complainant after separating from the one person she knew at the nightclub she was attending. 

14The third point of similarity relied on by the Crown is that both of the young women were affected by alcohol. Given the age of the complainants and given the time of day when the events were alleged to have occurred, the fact that both complainants had been drinking I do not find terribly significant. 

15The fourth aspect is that both the young women were unfamiliar with the city area. I am not sure why that is a relevant point of similarity. It seems to be more like a point of coincidence, (and I do not mean coincidence under the Evidence Act but pure coincidence). 

16The fifth aspect relied on by the Crown is that the events took place late at night. Given that both the young women were intoxicated at the time, this might be thought to be related to that earlier aspect but, in any case, is not terribly unusual when we are talking about sexual activity occurring after going out and drinking. 

17The sixth similarity concerns the place of the offence. I do not find it all surprising or unusual that sexual activity took place in a private place to which the accused had access. In any case, there are some dissimilarities. In relation to the first complainant, the assault occurred at work premises and in the second the alleged assault occurred in a room that the accused was renting. 

18The seventh point of similarity concerns the place of the meeting. The complainant in the first matter met the accused at Town Hall. The complainant in the second matter became separated from her friend near Central Station. I have got two things to say about that. Firstly, they seem to be relatively dissimilar places of meeting and, in any case, there is no evidence as to where, in fact, the accused met the complainant in this present trial. There is no evidence, to be precise, that they met at the nightclub the complainant was attending. 

19The eighth point of suggested similarity is that the accused invited each complainant to his place. That is certainly the case in relation to the first complainant, but in relation to the second complainant the most the Crown can rely on is something the complainant says the accused told her. He said, according to her, ""I found you on the street. You had been puking"". I repeat, the complainant herself had no memory of this and so the Crown can only point to what the accused said to the complainant about the circumstances in which they met. But the point raised by Ms Moen which I accept is that that says nothing about whether it was the accused who invited the complainant back to his place or the complainant made the suggestion herself. 

20The ninth aspect is the one that has troubled me most. In both cases, there is evidence that the complainant was awoken by sexual activity with a stranger. However, Ms Moen makes a very good point about this aspect of the similarities relied on by the Crown. It is only a point of similarity if the jury accept that the complainant in the present trial was, indeed, asleep and then awoken by sexual activity. But if they do that - if the jury accept it - then it is impossible to conclude other than that the accused was performing sexual activity on a woman who was in no position to consent to that sexual activity. So if the jury accept that the complainant in this trial was asleep when sexual activity was performed upon her by the accused which caused her to wake, then a conviction is almost inevitable. The experience of the other complainant is thus of very little probative value. If, on the other hand, the jury do not accept that the complainant in the present trial was asleep and then awoken by sexual activity with the accused, then there is no point of similarity that the Crown can rely on. 

21The tenth aspect concerns the nature of one of the sexual acts. Both acts involved digital penetration of the respective complainant's vagina. In the context of sexual activity, I find this is relatively commonplace. It adds nothing to the probative value of the tendency evidence. 

22The next two matters concern behaviour after the sexual activity ceased. The eleventh matter relied on by the Crown is that the accused escorted the complainants off the premises and the twelfth is that he then paid for a taxi to take them home. Such behaviour may or not be unusual but, in any case, what does it say about the fact in issue? The behaviour of the man escorting a woman with whom he has just had sex off the premises and paying for a taxi to go home says nothing about whether that sex was consensual or not. 

23The thirteenth aspect the Crown relied on only faintly. To the earlier complainant he gave his job as a comedian. He appears to have said something similar to one of the police investigating the present matter. That may have become a similarity of significance if identity was an issue, but it has been made clear that it is not. 

24The Crown accepts two important matters. Firstly, that it is bound by the tendency notice of 17 June 2011 and, secondly, that two High Court decisions - one of Phillips v The Queen (2006) 225 CLR 303 and a more recent one of Stubley v Western Australia [2011] HCA 7 - are authorities that I should consider, despite the fact that they both concern States which do not have the uniform Evidence Act . The Crown, with respect, quite accurately summarised the decision of the High Court in Phillips by saying that evidence that one complainant did not consent to sexual activity with Mr Phillips is not significantly probative on the question as to whether a different complainant consented to sexual activity with the same man. 

25No doubt conscious of that decision, the prosecution in Stubley attempted to suggest that the admission of propensity evidence in that case had significant probative value which went beyond the question as to whether any one complainant consented to sexual activity which took place with Dr Stubley. As I read the High Court decision in Stubley , their Honours found that the prosecution attempt had failed because the real issue ultimately was one of consent, (as in this case the accused in Stubley made admissions which left consent as the central issue). 

26And so it really is in this case. Upon analysis, the thirteen factors which the Crown says provide the significant probative value of the first complainant's evidence as regards the issues in this trial suffer from a number of problems, in particular, the lacuna in the evidence as to what occurred between when the complainant separated from her friend at the nightclub and when she woke up naked in bed with a stranger - the accused. 

27When I look at the tendency notice relied on by the Crown, it speaks of a person ""removing"" young intoxicated women from a public place to a private place under which he has control. But because of the lacuna that I have just mentioned, there is no direct evidence to establish that that is the way the accused behaved in relation to the complainant in this trial, removing her from a public place, and the fact that the Crown is forced to rely on inference says something about the probative value of what the Crown said is similar behaviour by the accused. 

28It is a matter of pure speculation as to how the complainant in the present trial ended up in the private place under the control of the accused, as I have said before, the only evidence being what the accused said to the complainant about him finding her on the street after she had vomited. 

29The Crown particularises the tendency as a tendency to act in a sexual opportunistic way. I interpret that as the Crown suggesting that it is unusual for a person to accept an opportunity to have sex. I do not accept the Crown submission. 

30The suggestion that the accused has acted in a ""predatory"" way is perhaps imprecise but, if it does mean anything, it presumably means actions by an accused designed to allow himself to have sexual activity with a woman who is not consenting. And if that is the proper way of understanding what the word predatory means, then it runs up against the problems identified by the High Court in Phillips and Stubley . 

31I am satisfied the proposed evidence does not have significant probative value. That means that I do not need to discuss two other matters: namely, whether the Crown would have been entitled to lead evidence that a jury convicted the accused on the earlier occasion; or examine the risk of unfair prejudice. Even though I do not need to, I will say a couple of things about those issues. 

32Firstly, even if the evidence was admissible as tendency evidence, I would not have allowed the Crown to adduce evidence that a jury had found the accused guilty. The fact that twelve people have come to a view about the earlier complainant's evidence is not at all relevant to the issue as to whether a different jury should accept what the earlier complainant said on a later occasion. 

33The only thing I want to say about the risk of unfair prejudice is this. There would be a real risk that the jury used the evidence as coincidence evidence rather than tendency evidence, and I note the Crown refers only to the evidence as being admissible as tendency evidence and has only served notice of ""tendency"" evidence. The risk is, of course, that the jury would say,

""What a remarkable coincidence. Here is a man who is either very unlucky at having young women make allegations of sexual assault against him or else  and this is much more likely  those women have made those allegations against him because he has done exactly what they suggest he did"". 

34Whether that would have been enough to outweigh the probative value of the evidence if I had found that it was significant, is something I need not determine beyond saying that in the circumstance where the Crown relies only on tendency evidence and not coincidence evidence, the fact that the jury might rely on coincidence evidence would be a significantly prejudicial factor. 

35Before making my final order, I wish to emphasise this. All rulings on evidence are made on the basis of the particular application put before me and the state of the evidence in the trial as it is at the time of the ruling. This is not to be taken as an invitation for the Crown to revisit my ruling, but if circumstances in the trial suggest that the evidence is substantially different from that on which I have made my ruling, then it may well be that the tendency evidence is admissible after all. 

36The order I make is that the tendency evidence is rejected as having no significant probative value.

2757336,Shaba v R [2011] NSWCCA 154,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Harrison J . 

2HALL J : I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Harrison J. 

3HARRISON J : The applicant was found guilty after a trial of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. This is an offence contrary to the provisions of s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 . The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 

4The victim of the offence was Carlos Sawa. The applicant was originally indicted on two charges including a charge of malicious wounding of the victim's brother Laurence Sawa. He was acquitted of that charge. Both offences were alleged to have occurred on 25 February 2006 during the course of a melee at Fairfield. 

5His Honour Nicholson DCJ sentenced the applicant on 18 January 2010 to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on that date with a balance of term of three years. (There is an obvious typographical error in paragraph [98] of the remarks on sentence). The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence on a number of grounds. They are as follows: 

Ground 1 : The sentencing judge erred in ordering the sentence to commence on 18 January 2010. 

Particulars: 

(a) His Honour erred in forming the view that he could not commence the sentence before 18 January 2010. 

(b) His Honour erred in not ordering the sentence to commence at an earlier date. 

(c) His Honour erred in failing to take into account a period [of] approximately six weeks during which the applicant was bail refused. 

Ground 2 : A less severe [sentence] was warranted in law and should have been passed having regard to: 

(d) the assistance given to authorities by the applicant 

(e) the sentence imposed on the offender Steven David. 

Particulars: 

His Honour should have ameliorated the sentence imposed on the applicant by ordering it to commence on a date before 18 January 2010. 

6For the reasons that follow, I consider that the first ground of appeal is made out but that the second ground of appeal fails. 

Background 

7His Honour summarised the facts that he found that were consistent with the jury's verdict. They are presently uncontroversial. That summary is contained in paragraphs [6] to [21] of his Honour's remarks on sentence as follows: 

""[6] Shaba was found guilty by a jury who were in fact considering two charges brought against him. Shaba also faced a trial on a charge of wounding Carlos Sawa's younger brother Laurence. On the second of the two charges, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Both charges arose from the same melee. Thus when determining the facts upon which he is to be sentenced for the wounding of Carlos, the fact finding task requires some understanding of why Shaba may have been acquitted of the Laurence wounding. 

[7] There is no dispute Laurence was wounded. Shaba's defence was that it was not he that caused the wound. The circumstances in which Laurence was wounded were more hectic. Laurence, his father, and supporters had reacted to the earlier wounding of Carlos. There was scope for another person to have wounded Laurence. While self defence was not run by either the Crown or Shaba, it was put by me in respect of the Laurence wounding. 

[8] While the jury may have regarded Laurence as unreliable around the circumstances of his wounding, it is unlikely that they regarded him as generally unreliable to the circumstances seeding the ultimate melee in Nelson Street. I am satisfied that the jury accepted the evidence of Carlos Sawa. 

[9] On 25 February 2006 Laurence, then aged fifteen, had attended a cousin's birthday party at a community hall in Fairfield. During the course of that party, word came back to the Sawa family home that there may have been alcohol at the party. Carlos aged twenty-three went to check. He saw his younger brother drinking. It was decided to take him home. Before they could leave, a fight broke out. Neither of the Sawa boys had any reason to be angry at anyone at the party. 

[10] Carlos, thinking Laurence may have become involved as he (Laurence) was saying his good-byes, investigated. One nineteen-year-old named Sammy jumped on Carlos' back. There was some pushing and shoving. There was an exchange of words. Then the two Sawa boys and their sister left and returned to their home. 

[11] Fifteen minutes after returning home, Carlos received a call on his mobile phone. He was told to go to the 7-Eleven or 'We will come down to your house'. He told his caller that he would go to the 7-Eleven. 

[12] Before he went, however, Carlos reported the call to his father, who determined the proper course was to go to the Fairfield Police Station. Carlos, the father and Laurence went in one car, two cousins followed in another. 

[13] Not far from the Fairfield police station is a reception house. When the Sawas arrived, there was a wedding reception in progress. Parking was at a premium. There were no parking spots near the police station. The nearest was 300 or so metres from it. 

[14] It seems, however, that enquiries may have been made over the mobile phone by others seeking to locate Carlos Sawa. When he arrived in Nelson Street, an acquaintance told him 'they are looking for you'. Carlos asked, 'Who.' The answer 'Sayed (the older brother of Sammy) and whoever else is with him.' 

[15] As this conversation was finishing, two vehicles arrived with several persons. They parked so as to block at least one of the Sawa vehicles. Sayed Hirmiz and his younger brother Sammy were in one car, Dilan Shaba was in a second car with others. Sayed Hirmiz gave evidence that he was not there. I am satisfied the jury took a different view. The offence had its origins in events occurring earlier that evening between Sammy Hirmiz and Carlos Sawa. I am satisfied that the jury accepted other Crown evidence establishing that Shaba was in the company of these two men and at least two others. 

[16] Carlos and Shaba were not associates, but were known to each other. Sayed approached Carlos saying words to the effect quote, 'Didn't you know he was my brother,' and then uttered a threat of some kind. Shaba approached. His hand was concealed beneath clothing. He put one hand on Carlos' left side and with the other hand withdrew a knife concealed in his clothing and plunged it into Carlos Sawa's left flank penetrating through the left kidney. 

[17] The entry wound was through the left abdominal wall into the left kidney entering from the back and penetrating through the front of that kidney. 

[18] To this point there were no fights, no confusion, just the earlier remarks from Sayed and the singling out of Carlos by Shaba. When other supporters of Carlos realized what had happened, they immediately responded. In the course of that response, other injuries were incurred by Laurence. The jury by its verdict has determined the Crown has failed to prove Shaba is responsible for them. That finding by the jury must be given full recognition by me. 

[19] The immediate impact of the wound was to cause internal and external bleeding. Carlos Sawa began to feel dizzy. He was concerned about his brother's injuries, which must have occurred shortly after his own. 

[20] Carlos Sawa was taken by ambulance from the scene to a nearby hospital. There he was subject to immediate surgery to stop the bleeding and insert a ureter stent. A second surgery procedure was required to short circuit blood that had been travelling from arteries to a vein without passing through the kidney. He has been left with 70% to 80% of normal function in his left kidney. 

[21] It took three to four months before he was able to straighten his back. During his hospitalisation and recovery, he experienced depression, anxiety, anger, and feelings of helplessness."" 

Ground 1 

8The applicant complains that his Honour erred in forming the view that he ""could not"" commence the sentence before 18 January 2010 and, as a corollary, that he failed to commence the sentence at some earlier date. At paragraph [96] of his remarks on sentence he said this: 

""[96] I have determined that the sentence should commence from today. I can do no other. Although he was bail refused, the view the law takes is that that period of time was fully consumed by the sentence imposed by Berman AJ"". 

9In this last respect it should be observed that previously, on 12 December 2007, Berman AJ had imposed a sentence upon the applicant for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 1 year, 7 months and 18 days in respect of that offence committed on 9 April 2006. The applicant had surrendered to the police on 24 April 2006: see R v AB [2007] NSWSC 1517. The sentence was backdated to the date of his arrest so that the non-parole period expired on the day that he was sentenced. His Honour noted that the applicant was bail refused on ""an unrelated matter"", which was the matter that is the subject of the present application to this Court. 

10The applicant was granted bail in relation to this matter but was not released for a period of 1 month and 13 days. He was therefore in custody from 12 December 2007 until 24 January 2008 in circumstances solely referable to the matters that came before Nicholson DCJ and for one of which he was sentenced. In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted that the applicant was on bail from 12 December 2007 until the date that he was sentenced on 18 January 2010. The applicant contended that this was wrong as his Honour failed to take account of the fact that the applicant was not released on bail until 24 January 2008. The period of 1 month and 13 days in custody before that occurred was solely referable to the present offence. 

11The Crown accepted this submission in the following terms: 

""17. It would appear that when it came to sentence over two months later his Honour overlooked this period of pre-sentence custody. It is the Crown submission that this Court should intervene to backdate the commencement date of the sentence by one month and thirteen days in accordance with sections 24(a) and 47(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The sentence should be backdated to commence on 6 December 2009, to take into account the total of forty-four days pre-sentence custody."" 

12Section 47(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is as follows: 

""(3) In deciding whether or not to make a direction under subsection (2) (a) with respect to a sentence of imprisonment, and in deciding the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced, the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, any of the offences to which the sentence relates."" 

13It would appear that his Honour inadvertently failed to take account of the applicant's period in custody that was solely referable to this offence. In my opinion the sentence should be backdated to take account of this period. In this respect I note that it is preferable to backdate the sentence than to reduce it to account for the time served: see, for example, R v Newman and Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; (2004) 145 A Crim R 361 at [26] - [32]; R v Close (1992) 31 NSWLR 743; R v Schodde [2003] NSWCCA 164; (2003) 142 A Crim R 307; Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30 at [2] - [6]. 

Ground 2 

14In his remarks on sentence his Honour made specific reference to what was said by Berman AJ in R v AB concerning the discount for the applicant's assistance to authorities in those proceedings. In particular, the applicant undertook to give evidence against co-offenders Shamouil and David. His Honour said this at [64]: 

""[64] In his remarks on sentence Berman AJ noted assistance given by [the applicant] to police investigating the murder of Audisho. His Honour said at 

'8 ... He surrendered himself to police in company with his then solicitor on 24 April, 2006. On this day he participated in an interview with the police. He was arrested and charged and has remained in custody since that day. The offender later participated in a further interview with police whereby an induced statement was obtained. Following that that there was also an occasion where the offender went with police and drove with them to relevant places, re-tracing his movements on 9 April, 2006... 

12 One of the most important factors which I must bear in mind in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender concerns his assistance to the authorities. The offender has provided assistance in the past to the police by telling them what occurred on the 9 April, 2006 including, as I mentioned before, retracing his steps with them. But it is his assistance in the future which is of most significance. The offender has undertaken to give evidence against both Mr Shambouil and Mr David. A signed undertaking to that effect was tendered to me today. Of course, one of the most important factors in assessing the impact that that assistance will have on the sentence to be imposed concerns the value of that promised assistance. There was no material from a police officer put before me today but the Crown Prosecutor advised me that without evidence from the offender the Crown would have difficulty in obtaining a conviction against Mr Shamouil, the man alleged to have actually done the shooting. 

13 The value of the offender's promised assistance is somewhat less in the case of Mr David because of other evidence available against him but there is no doubt that, taken as a whole, the offender's promise of assistance is of considerable value to the authorities. That promise of assistance came fairly early in the piece too, it first being provided to the police on 20 June 2006. As a result the offender has been held in protection and there was evidence before me demonstrating that the conditions of his custody are at present more onerous than the general prison population.' 

His Honour continued, 

14 ...The discount which would be imposed for the utilitarian benefit of that plea is therefore a significant one. I will not separately indicate the discounts I have allowed for the assistance to the authorities and the plea of guilty but will indicate that, taking both of those matters together, the sentence I will impose on the offender is half what it would otherwise have been...'"" 

15In R v AB , Berman AJ had earlier referred to the applicant when sentencing him in these terms at [29] to [32]: 

""[29] This is a case where I will also find special circumstances enabling me to extend the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. There are, however, constraints on the sentence that I can impose. I am not able to discount a sentence because of assistance to the level where the sentence is unreasonably disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offender's conduct and the non-parole period I select must also bear a relationship to what the offender did. It was serious criminal conduct for him, knowing that a young man had just been shot, to assist those who had just done so by driving them from the scene of the crime and taking them to a place of refuge. 

[30] The offender has been in custody for a period of one year, seven months and eighteen days. Mr Scragg submits in the circumstances of this case that that is a sufficient period of imprisonment or, at the very least, is sufficient as a non-parole period. I accept his latter submission. I do not, however, consider that a head sentence of that length is sufficient. The offender is sentenced as follows: 

[31] I set a non parole period of one year, seven months and eighteen days to date from 24 April, 2006 and impose a head sentence of two and a half years' imprisonment. The non parole period expires today and so as far as this matter is concerned I order that the offender is to be released to parole forthwith although, as I mentioned, he is currently bail refused on an unrelated matter. 

[32] I will indicate that in the absence of the undertaking to give assistance in the future, the head sentence would have been one of three and a half years imprisonment."" 

16It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour Nicholson DCJ failed to have regard to a practical limitation constraining Berman AJ, as the net effect was a sentence that overlooked the assistance given to authorities by the applicant. His Honour took what the applicant described as ""the unusual step"" of acknowledging what he inferred could be the applicant's justifiable sense of grievance about the sentence imposed by Berman AJ, although, as his Honour noted, a discount for assistance should normally only attract a discount once and with respect to the instant sentencing proceedings. In short the applicant argued that Berman AJ was mindful to give the applicant a discount for assistance and would, if he could practically have done so, have given him a greater discount. Because Berman AJ was limited by the practicalities of the sentencing exercise that faced him, this meant that the applicant received less than a full recognition for the assistance that he gave. The applicant submitted, in effect, that his Honour Nicholson DCJ was somehow entitled, if not required, to make up the difference in the case before him and that he should have done so. 

17The applicant contended that there was nothing in s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that would prevent a sentencing tribunal from having regard to an allowance for assistance that had not previously been taken into account. Moreover, s 23(1) of the Act specifically contemplates the Court taking into account assistance provided in relation to other offences: see below. He argued that even though Berman AJ had taken his assistance into account to some extent, there was scope for it to be considered again and factored into the sentencing exercise that confronted Nicholson DCJ. 

18There are in my opinion a number of difficulties with this submission. First, as the applicant acknowledges, Berman AJ took the assistance that he gave or promised into account. The applicant has already been given the benefit of the exercise of a discretion to reduce his sentence in accordance with s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , which is in these relevant terms: 

"" 23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities 

(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence. 

(2) In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters: 

(b) the significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered, 

(c) the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender, 

(d) the nature and extent of the offender's assistance or promised assistance, 

(e) the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 

(f) any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 

(g) whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 

(h) any injury suffered by the offender or the offender's family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender's family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist, 

(i) whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence, 

(3) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 

(4) A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must: 

(a) indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and 

(b) state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and 

(c) where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason. 

(5) ..."" 

19The factors that a sentencing judge is entitled to consider in this respect are many. It must be assumed that Berman AJ had regard to all of them when he sentenced the applicant. A review of his Honour's reasons does not suggest to me that he would have provided the applicant with a greater degree of recognition for his assistance if he had not been constrained by his view that the applicant had served sufficient time in custody by the time the sentence was passed. Indeed, his Honour's view that the applicant should be released immediately must necessarily have been reached by taking his very assistance to authorities into account. 

20Secondly, Berman AJ reduced the applicant's head sentence by 12 months in recognition of this assistance, from 3 years and 6 months to 2 years and 6 months. This is a reduction of approximately 28.5 per cent. It must also be assumed that in reducing the sentence by that proportion his Honour was mindful of the need to ensure, in accordance with s 23(3), that any lesser penalty imposed was not disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. It does not seem to me that the applicant could have demonstrated any error in Berman AJ's approach had he sought leave to challenge it at the time. I can see no proper basis for him notionally doing so now. 

21Thirdly, his Honour Nicholson DCJ appears clearly to have had regard to the unfortunate consequences for the applicant of his offer of assistance in any event, and to have taken them into account when sentencing him. This is reflected in some of his remarks on sentence. This is most apparent at paragraphs [69] to [73] and [94] as follows: 

""[69] The sentence imposed by Hidden J on David was one of 3 years reduced to 2 years in recognition of a plea of guilty to two offences with a non-parole period of 15 months. In the normal course of events an offender standing for sentence may only receive benefit of any specified act of assistance on one occasion. Should he come for sentence later on a fresh matter, the past assistance that has already been taken into account cannot be used a second time. 

[70] In this case, however, Shaba would be entitled to entertain what I regard as a justifiable sense of grievance in respect of the credit for assistance he has given to police and his willingness to give evidence to the court. When I raised this matter during sentencing submissions, the Crown did not seek to dissuade me from making appropriate recognition of the assistance although she argued that I could not give the benefit provided by s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

[71] My understanding of her submission is that I could mitigate the penalty otherwise appropriate but not specify any percentage, simply put the assistance as being one of the favourable features on sentencing. 

[72] There is evidence before the court from Shaba which I accept: 

(1) That whilst in custody, he went into a protection environment on account of having assisted police and would return to the unit upon re-entering custody. 

(2) That he has been on bail for 2 years during which time he has been fearful of his safety and that of his family. 

(3) That his fears are well grounded, not only because of the well recognised assessment of courts of the likelihood of violent response from the criminal milieu in circumstances such as this, but because of specific matters that may constitute examples of attacks upon him... 

[73] I am satisfied that after his release [to bail] from custody, the aftermath of his assistance has seen him subjected to threats and potential lethal criminal activity. He holds fears for his safety in custody. His time in custody will be more stressful and arduous than had he not given assistance. It is to be remembered that the assistance he gave was against two people who I have assumed to be, from the evidence, members of a gang. 


***** 

[94] Both gave assistance to authorities. In my view Shaba's assistance was of greater utility."" 

22It is clear that his Honour was minded somehow to take into account all of these consequences to the applicant that resulted from the assistance he had provided. He did not indicate how or to what extent he did so in arriving at his final view. I note in this last respect that in accordance with s 23(6) of the Act his Honour's failure to comply with the requirements of s 23(4) of the Act concerning the sentence does not invalidate it. 

23Finally, and in my view most significantly, the sentence that his Honour imposed does not warrant intervention by this Court. On the contrary, the sentence seems to me, in all of the circumstances of the case, to be somewhat favourable to the applicant, bearing in mind the maximum penalty and applicable standard non-parole period. The attack upon the victim was vicious and unprovoked. His injuries were very serious. The applicant was on conditional liberty at the time. He has not expressed remorse. He is not suffering from any mental health issues. The attack involved the use of a knife about which the Courts have expressed particular abhorrence. The applicant's use of the knife was a feature that specifically aggravated the seriousness of the offence: see R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216 at [7]. 

24His Honour found special circumstances and allowed a non-parole period of 50 per cent of the total term. That was also very favourable to the applicant. His finding that it was likely that the applicant had prospects of rehabilitation was generous having regard to the lack of any demonstrated remorse. The non-parole period of 3 years is 42 per cent of the standard non-parole period. This reflects a significant degree of leniency. 

25Although the second ground of appeal also refers to the sentence imposed upon Mr David, the applicant's submissions do not adumbrate a detailed case based upon principles of parity. Indeed, there is no mention at all of that concept. There is an obvious reason for that. This application deals with the sentence imposed by Nicholson DCJ. Any concerns that the applicant may have entertained about a comparison between the sentence imposed by Berman AJ on him and the sentence imposed by Hidden J on Mr David were concerns relating to Berman AJ's sentence and not the present one. 

26Hidden J sentenced Mr David as an accessory after the fact to murder and assault: see R v Shamouil and David [2009] NSWSC 24. The applicant drew particular attention to what his Honour said at [46] to [51] as follows: 

""[46] Shaba was sentenced by Berman AJ after pleading guilty to that offence. At that time it was the Crown case that both Shamouil and David were involved in the murder, and Shaba's offence was the assistance he afforded to both of them. At that stage of the proceedings it was necessary to protect his identity from publication, and his Honour's remarks were published as R v AB [2007] NSWSC 1517. He was sentenced on the basis that he drove Shamouil and David from the scene after the shooting. He drove Shamouil to his home, a journey of about five minutes, dropping David off in a back street on the way. 

[47] Shaba is also a member of the Assyrian community. He had a minor criminal record, which Berman AJ ignored for the purpose of sentence. His subjective case was otherwise favourable. Of particular significance was his assistance to the authorities in relation to the murder which, together with his plea of guilty, persuaded his Honour to allow him a 50 per cent reduction of sentence. He had been in custody for almost one year and eight months, and his Honour accepted that that was a sufficient non-parole period in the circumstances. Accordingly, he imposed a sentence of 2 years imprisonment but set a non-parole period which enabled his immediate release. 

[48] The Crown prosecutor acknowledged that the criminality of Shaba and David as accessories after the fact fell into the lower end of the range. However, he submitted that their culpability was comparable and that I should take the undiscounted sentence of Berman AJ as the starting point in determining the appropriate sentence for David. However, I am persuaded by the argument of senior counsel for David that I should not approach the matter in that way. In my view, David's criminality in disposing of Shamouil's mobile phone and clothing was less than that of Shaba, who drove both offenders from the scene of the crime and delivered Shamouil to the safety of his home. Moreover, Berman AJ was constrained in the leniency he was able to extend to Shaba because of the length of time he had already spent in custody. Clearly, his Honour's sentence was structured in a practical way to ensure that his custody came to an end. This is not to say that the sentence his Honour passed is to be ignored, but the sentence of David calls for a different approach. 

[49] As with Shamouil, I shall treat this offender's subsequent drug offence as a factor disentitling him to leniency. In other respects he has a favourable subjective case. He also enjoys support from his family and within his community, he is remorseful, and I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. His pleas of guilty were late and, like Shamouil, they will earn him a reduction of the overall sentence of roughly 15 per cent. In his case there are special circumstances arising from the need to foster his rehabilitation and because the sentences I pass must be cumulative upon the sentence for the drug offence. Consideration must also be given to totality. 

[50] Although the offence of common assault did not involve actual violence, I consider that it calls for a short custodial sentence. That sentence will be concurrent with the sentence I pass for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder, in the interests of totality and because the two offences are closely linked. Both sentences will commence on 1 June 2008, that is, immediately upon the expiry of the non-parole period fixed in respect of the drug offence. His period of custody thereafter is fairly referable to the present offences. 

[51] For the common assault I shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months. For the offence of accessory after the fact, I would reduce a sentence of 3 years to 2 years in recognition of the plea of guilty. I shall fix a non-parole period of 15 months. That will secure his release on 31 August 2009, whereupon he will be subject to the sanction of parole for a further 15 months."" 

27There were differences in the degree of criminality between David and the applicant. They were not favourable to the applicant. In any event his Honour Nicholson DCJ adverted to the sentence imposed upon Mr David and its relationship to his sentencing exercise at paragraph [69] of his remarks on sentence referred to earlier. The extent to which his Honour took that matter into account, or the correctness of his having done so, do not arise for consideration here. An application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Nicholson DCJ for malicious wounding inflicting grievous bodily harm does not attract an application of parity principles going to the alleged differences between sentences imposed on the applicant and Mr David for the offences of accessory after the fact to murder imposed by others. 

28In my view, for all of these reasons, no lesser sentence is warranted in law. 

Orders 

29Accordingly, I would make the following orders: 

1. Grant leave to appeal. 

2. Allow the appeal in part. 

3.Order in lieu of the sentence imposed upon the applicant by Nicholson DCJ on 18 January 2010 commencing on that day, that the sentence imposed upon the applicant commence on 5 December 2009. 

4. Otherwise confirm his Honour's orders. 

30It follows that the applicant's non-parole period will now expire on 4 December 2012 and that the first day upon which he will be entitled to be released on parole is 5 December 2012. The additional term set by his Honour will now expire on 4 December 2015.

2ADAMS J : 

Introduction 

3The applicant seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed in the District Court on 6 November 2009. The applicant pleaded guilty to committing an act of indecency towards a child under 16 years, being count 7 on an indictment dated 1 May 2009, which contained a number of other counts of which the applicant was subsequently found guilty following a trial. The convictions were all of child sexual offences committed against the same victim. On 6 November 2009 the applicant was sentenced as follows:

4The total effective sentence was 11 years, 8 months and 29 days (8 February 2008 to 5 November 2019, of which the non-parole period was 9 years, 2 months and 28 days (8 February 2008 to 5 May 2017). 

5There are two grounds of appeal. Firstly, in relation to count 4, that the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances and in failing to set a parole period in excess of one-third of the non-parole period, and, secondly, that the sentencing judge erred in setting a total sentence where the effective balance of the sentence did not exceed one-third of the overall non-parole period, notwithstanding a finding of special circumstances. 

6It is conceded by counsel for the applicant that the criminality involved in the offences was serious and there is no issue raised concerning the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness and the subjective matters relevant in the exercise of his Honour's discretion. The only complaint made concerning the sentences imposed is that the total effective non-parole period is 78.7% of the total sentence, not 75%, resulting in a non-parole period that is longer by 6 months than would have applied if the ratio stipulated to which s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 had been adopted. 

Facts 

7For the purposes of the appeal, the facts are not controversial and the following account is taken largely from the learned sentencing judge's reasons for sentence. The victim of the offences was the applicant's natural daughter, who was born on 4 July 1988. The first offence occurred some time in 1997 when the applicant was about 43 years of age. 

8The offences came to the attention of police somewhat unusually. On 21 March 2007, in the family home, the victim complained to her mother and one of her brothers in the presence of the applicant that he had sexually abused her and used both his hands and his tongue to do so, although she did not mention that he had also used his penis. The applicant's wife (the victim's mother) told the offender to leave the family home, which he did. The applicant sought some assistance, perhaps with the idea of being reconciled with his family and was told that he would have to go to the police, which he eventually did on 19 April 2007, and made admissions to inappropriate sexual conduct towards his daughter. Police sought then to interview the victim but she was initially unwilling either to make a statement or for charges to be preferred. Eventually she relented and made a number of statements to police about which the applicant was interviewed for a second time. He made certain further admissions but denied the detail and severity of various incidents, as well as their timing. 

9The indictment reflected the offences disclosed by the victim which the applicant continued to deny, though he maintained the admissions previously made. The sentencing judge concluded that the jury accepted the evidence of the victim in preference to the statements made by the applicant in his interviews with police. 

10The first count occurred when the victim was aged 8 or 9 years old. She was sitting on the couch in the lounge room in the family home when the applicant approached her and inserted his penis at least into the outer labia of her vagina and ejaculated. Count 2, also occurring in 1997, involved the applicant's touching the outer labia of the victim's vagina before inserting his fingers whilst the victim was taking a bath. Sometime between 1 January 1997 and 3 July 1998 the victim was taking a shower when the applicant entered the shower cubicle and deliberately touched her body with his penis (count 3). In respect of count 4, the offence of persistent sexual intercourse with a child, the sentencing judge found that the jury accepted that this involved at least three events of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The victim was then between 10 and 11 years old and occurred when her mother and brothers were absent from the family home. On each occasion the applicant approached the victim in her bed and performed cunnilingus. The offence in count 8 occurred on 27 September 2002 when the victim was 14 years old. The applicant stripped her naked, dragged her to the parental bedroom, threw her on the bed and rubbed his penis against her buttocks. Count 7 (to which the applicant pleaded guilty) concerned an occasion between 1 January and 3 July 2004, when the victim was aged 15 years. This involved the applicant drawing the victim's attention to an act of simulated masturbation. 



Relevant findings 

11The sentencing judge found that the applicant showed very little remorse, if any, since he continued to maintain after conviction that the victim told lies about the extent of his sexual misconduct, claiming that the version that he gave to the police was correct. His Honour also found that a ""very significant aggravating factor"", to which s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 refers, was that the emotional harm caused by the offences was substantial, involving significant post traumatic stress disorder with extensive deliberate self harm and marked impulsivity manifested by binge drinking and eating, reckless and dangerous driving and spending sprees, continuing emotional difficulties in dealing with her brothers and mother and keeping and maintaining friendships. 

12The applicant's personal background was problematical. His mother's cousin enticed him and his brother to commit indecent acts on each other or themselves when the applicant was 10 or 11 years old and, when he was 13 years old, this person sexually assaulted the applicant, including on one occasion, forced sodomy. The applicant was disowned by his own parents and required to leave home when he was 15 years of age, their further relations significantly deteriorating. After living a somewhat unsettled life the applicant married in May 1982 and, from that time, was in constant employment and supporting his family. Aside from minor offences as a teenager, the applicant had no criminal record. The sentencing judge accepted that the likelihood of the applicant's reoffending is low. 

Determination of the non-parole period 

13After discussing the facts and noting statistical information about sentencing, his Honour said - 

""[36] I have determined that by partially accumulating the sentences to be passed ... for all six offences ... the head sentence will be eleven years and nine months imprisonment and the effective non-parole period will be nine years and three months ... [to] commence on 8 February 2008. 

... 

[38] In so far as it is necessary to find special circumstances to depart from the statutory nexus between the head sentence and the non-parole period, the main reason for breaking the statutory nexus is the offender's age and the fact that this is his first sentence of imprisonment for any offence whatsoever and even though he is not a young man, the experience of being in goal, even as a very mature man, can be extremely frightening and distressing."" 

14In respect, however, of counts 2, 4 and 8, his Honour said that he did not find special circumstances. Although, on the face of it, this appears to be inconsistent with the passage set out above, it seems to me that this merely expressed a mode of calculation and that his Honour's intention was to find special circumstances applicable to the total effective sentence, the adjustment made in some periods rendering further adjustments unnecessary. The ultimate non-parole period, however, far from being reduced from that which would have resulted from the application of the statutory ratio, was increased. It seems clear, with respect, that his Honour was unaware of this affect of his calculations and that the ultimate result was inadvertent. 

Submissions on appeal 

15As has been mentioned, counsel for the applicant did not submit that, accumulation aside, there were present special circumstances which justified an increase of the statutory ratio but sought only for this ratio to be applied in the applicant's case. During argument on the appeal, counsel for the Crown accepted that the sentencing judge's arithmetic was in error and his Honour had inadvertently arrived at a result which increased rather than reduced the indicative non-parole period. Counsel submitted that, nevertheless, this Court would not interfere, contending that no lesser sentence is warranted in law, vide s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Counsel for the Crown submitted that the reason for taking this course is that otherwise the non-parole period would be unjustifiably lenient. 

Consideration 

16It is not necessary to analyse the facts in this case in any detail. Counsel for the Crown conceded that the overall sentence was well within the sentencing judge's discretion. That being so, although there is no doubt that a non-parole period can be imposed that is longer than would have been the case if the statutory ratio were applied, there should be good reasons for taking this course. The sentencing judge did not indicate any such reasons since, unsurprisingly, he did not intend to bring about this result. Nor do the facts suggest any reason for departing from the statutory ratio in respect of the overall effective sentence. 

17In my view this Court should follow the approach in R v Attard [2004] NSWCCA 376 where Buddin J (the other judges agreeing) said - 

""[21] For present purposes it is necessary to refer only to the individual sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 and 3. In each case the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period which was in accordance with the normal statutory proportion, that is 75% of the head sentence. However, when the later sentence was accumulated upon the earlier sentence, the consequence was that the overall non-parole period produced was almost 80% of the head sentence. Although there is no prohibition against the setting of a non-parole period which is more than 75% of the head sentence, there is no reason to believe that that is the result which his Honour intended in the present case. Indeed the indications are to the contrary. Moreover, this Court has intervened on a number of occasions in which the accumulation of sentences has produced an outcome similar to that which has occurred in the present case. See R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; R v Close (1993) 31 NSWLR 742; R v Bolamatu [2002] NSWCCA 454; R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215; R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86; R v Jammeh [2004] NSWCCA 327."" 

18The totality of criminality does not suggest that an effective non-parole period of 8 years and 9 months is unjustifiably lenient. 

19The simplest way of making the necessary adjustment is to reduce the non-parole period for the sentence in respect of count 4 to seven years with the consequence that the non-parole period in respect of that offence will expire on 5 November 2016, the balance of term to commence on 6 November 2016 and the overall sentence expire on 5 June 2019. 

20I propose the following orders: 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 

(2) Appeal against sentence on count 4 allowed. 

(3) Sentence on count 4 quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 7 years from 6 November 2009 to expire on 5 November 2016, and a balance of term of 3 years to expire on 5 November 2019. 

(4) Appeal otherwise dismissed. 

(5) The appellant will be eligible for release on parole on 6 November 2016. 

21HALL J : I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Adams J.

		15 July 2011",2011-07-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757343,Moustafa TAHA v R [2011] NSWCCA 137,"Judgment  1GILES JA : I agree with Adams J.  2R S HULME J : In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for Judgment of Adams J.  I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and, subject to the following remarks, with his Honour's reasons.  3Given the terms used, I am unsure whether the sentencing Judge did double count when he said ""it is the threat that the Court is taking into account as the aggravating feature"".  However, I am satisfied that if double counting occurred no undue weight was placed on the combination of the robbery and threat occasioned by the Applicant's remark ""get inside, I have a gun"".  4Accordingly, I do not find it necessary to embark upon what, in the circumstances of this case, I see as a barren argument as to whether the threat went beyond the fear that was a minimum ingredient in the offence of robbery.  5Even had I been persuaded that there was error on  the part of the sentencing Judge, I would still have been in favour of dismissing the appeal.  The Applicant's premeditated offending, accompanied by at least implicit threats of violence and even death, meant that no lesser sentence should have been imposed.  6ADAMS J :  Introduction  7The applicant seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed on 27 May 2010 in the District Court in respect of offences of robbery committed on 1 December 2008 and demanding property with menaces committed on 14 December 2008.  He also asked to be taken into account on a Form 1 the offences of stealing from a dwelling house, obtaining money by deception and possessing a prohibited drug.  Except for the last of these offences, they were committed against the same victim.  In respect of the first offence, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 25 February 2010 was imposed with an additional term of 2 years and 4 months.  In respect of count 2 the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 25 August 2009 and an additional term of 1 year and 7 months.  The effective total sentence was 5 years and 10 months commencing 25 August 2009 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months.  8The applicant pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial and the sentencing judge gave him a ten percent discount for this plea.  9The applicant relies on the following grounds of appeal -  (i) the sentencing judge erred in her approach to the applicant's plea of guilty by taking into account the strength of the Crown case when considering the utilitarian value of the plea;  (ii) the sentencing judge erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor a matter which was implicit in, or an element of, the offence and  (iii) the sentencing judge erred in falling to take into account as a mitigating feature the fact that the applicant had himself been sexually assaulted at a young age.  The facts  10The facts as found by the sentencing judge were contained in a statement of facts agreed to by both parties. The following account, which I understand to be non-controversial, is taken from this statement.  Her Honour's reasons did not refer to all the relevant details, perhaps for privacy reasons but, having regard to the contentions of the applicant in this Court, it is necessary to refer to the agreed facts in somewhat more detail.  11In the early morning of 30 November 2008 the applicant entered the Oxford Hotel in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst.  He and the victim got into conversation.  About half an hour later, they left the bar upon being informed that it was closing and arranged to go together to the victim's unit.  When they arrived, the applicant asked the victim to shut the curtains, which he did.  The victim then said to the offender, ""What do you want out of this?"" referring to sex, the applicant answering, ""We'll see what happens"".  They discussed watching a DVD.  (It was no part of the Crown case that, as it happened, the applicant is homosexual but, in all events, this is immaterial.)  The applicant sat on the lounge while the victim went into his bedroom to change his clothes, throwing his keys and wallet on the floor in the bedroom near the end of the bed.  He then went to get a beer from the fridge.  The applicant then entered his bedroom, found the victim's mobile telephone in the sock drawer and picked up the victim's house keys and wallet from the floor.  It is clear that, at this point, the victim was unaware of the applicant's actions.  They engaged in conversation, at one point the victim placing his hands on the applicant's shoulder.  The applicant said, ""Take it slow, take it easy, maybe you can give me a massage later"".  He then took notes from the victim's wallet, counted them and asked, ""So how much cash have you got?""  He replaced the money.  A short time later he told the victim he had received a phone call from a friend who had arrived in the area and was leaving.  He did so.  12Unknown to the victim, when the applicant left the apartment, he was in possession of the victim's house keys, mobile phone and $800 in cash, which he had removed from the wallet.  A few minutes after he left, the victim realised that something was wrong, for he could not find his house keys.  He found his emptied wallet and then discovered that his mobile phone had been stolen. He telephoned his number to speak to the applicant but was unsuccessful.  He went to sleep and, waking about noon, started an exchange of text messages with the applicant.  In substance the victim asked the applicant to return his keys or the police would be contacted.  The applicant responded by promising to return the keys and, in effect, saying that he would claim that the victim had given them to him and forgotten about it.  He denied taking any cash.  The exchange ended with the victim promising to pay $300 to the applicant to return the phone and the keys.  The applicant's conduct constituted the offences in the Form 1.  13At about 3.00am on 1 December 2008 the applicant gained access to the victim's building and called the victim saying that he was outside, knocking on the door a number of times. The victim opened the door and the applicant moved into the doorway, pointed to his jacket pocket and said, ""Get inside I have a gun"".  The victim stepped back.  The applicant pushed through the door which was then closed. He demanded that the victim hand over his credit cards.  The victim did so and the applicant then demanded that he provide his PIN, telling the victim that, if it worked, he would get his keys and phone back.  The applicant continued to make threats and the victim provided his PIN to him. The applicant said, ""I have a mate outside, I'm gonna give him the PIN and if it doesn't work I'll know within 10 minutes"".  He added, ""If you go to the cops, me and my mates and there's a guy out the front door, all know where you live and will be back"".  The victim then opened the door and handed the two credit cards to the applicant's co-offender.  Shortly afterwards the victim contacted the credit card providers and reported his cards were stolen.  As it happened, a little over half an hour after he did so, attempts to use one of the cards were made but the transactions were declined.  In the meantime, the victim sent a message to his mobile phone asking the applicant to return his keys and phone by leaving them outside the door or in the letterbox, saying that he would not open the door again.  These were the facts giving rise to the first count of the indictment.  The facts in relation to the offence of obtaining money by deception which was on the Form 1 arise from the applicant's use of the victim's debit card to withdraw $1000, $500 and a further $500 from ATMs prior to the victim reporting the theft of his card.  14At 11.35pm on 7 December 2008 the intercom to the victim's unit was buzzed.  The victim did not answer it but, within a couple of minutes, he saw the applicant through the peephole in his door.  He telephoned police and, whilst he was on the phone, heard knocking on the door.  He returned to the door and heard the applicant say something like ""He's not here"" or ""He's not answering"".  Police attended about five minutes later but the applicant had gone.  About three hours later, at 2.30am on 8 December, the victim heard knocking at his door and again telephoned police.  There was a smashing sound and, when police arrived, they found the bathroom window was smashed, apparently with a brass bolt.  At 1.22 am on 13 December 2008 the victim was called by the applicant who asked him, ""Is that Brad?"" to which the victim said ""Yes"".  The applicant said, ""I found a set of keys about a week ago at the Oxford, your name and number is on the key ring"". The victim said, ""Who is this?""  The applicant said, ""I am a bar tender at the Oxford, I found the keys about a week ago"" and gave a false name.  (The victim's mobile number and name was recorded on his set of keys.)  The victim, who recognized the applicant's voice, told him to take the keys to the Kings Cross Police Station.  A few minutes later the applicant was called again but did not answer.  15The facts in relation to count 2 on the indictment are as follows.  At 1.26am on 14 December 2008 the victim received a further call from the applicant who said, ""If you want the keys, come to the bar"". The victim asked him which bar and the applicant said, ""The Oxford"".  About 30 minutes later, the victim received a further call but it was answered by a friend.  Two other calls were made three hours or so later but the victim did not answer. About 15 minutes after the last of these calls, the applicant again telephoned the offender and told him to come out to the car park because he wanted to apologise.  When the victim refused, the applicant said, ""I'll put a bullet through your head and you'll regret it the rest of your life.  The boys know where you live and can break into your apartment and will put a bullet through your head"".  The victim asked why the applicant was targeting him and what it would take to get him out of his life.  The applicant said that it would take $1000.  The victim suggested that they meet shortly afterwards at a caf in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross.  The applicant agreed and the victim then contacted the police. The applicant made three further calls about 15 minutes apart to the offender and told him what he would be wearing.  The victim did not attend the meeting but, of course, police did.  No attempt to arrest the applicant was made at this time.  He was simply observed.  Fifteen minutes after the agreed time for the meeting, the applicant telephoned the victim to ask him why the police were at the cafe and the victim explained that, it being Kings Cross, the police were ""always around"".  Over the next 15 minutes the applicant made eleven further calls to the victim but he did not answer.  The applicant left a message on the twelfth call warning the victim about ""silent treatment"" and saying that he had ""pushed the button hard now"".  A couple of days later, when the victim returned to his unit with police, on being warned by a neighbour that his burglar alarm had been triggered two days before, he saw jemmy marks near the lock of his front door.  16Following telephone intercepts that were obtained about a month or so later, the applicant was arrested at his premises on 25 February 2009. On the search of his premises police located cannabis in a resealable bag, the total weight of which was .84 grams.  17The applicant told police that he had met the victim at the Oxford Hotel and had gone back to his unit on his invitation.  He said that the victim had made a number of sexual advances but the applicant told him that he was not gay.   He falsely claimed that the victim gave his mobile phone and keys to the applicant as part of an agreement to purchase cocaine for him.  He said that, when he returned to the victim's unit on 1 December, he assaulted the victim because he made further sexual advances and that the victim gave him his credit card and PIN so that he would stop assaulting him.  He claimed that he threw away the credit card but also stated that he went to the ATM with an associate whom he named who withdrew $2000 and gave him $1000.  The evidence on sentence  18Tendered on the applicant's behalf at the sentencing proceeding was the report of Mr Borenstein, a clinical psychologist. The account given by the applicant to Mr Borenstein of the circumstances of the offence was that he met the victim at the Oxford Hotel and that the latter suggested the two return to his home where the victim ""allegedly made sexual advances towards Mr Taha and touched his shoulders which made him feel uncomfortable"". The report continues -  At this point of the interview, Mr Taha said he was sexually abused when aged about 11, and the complainant's actions towards him reactivated the memory of the abuse. Mr Taha responded defensively, ""I just went off"". Mr Taha realised the complainant was fearful. The complainant provided Mr Taha his key card and pin, ""I took $2000, I just wanted to harm him"".  19It is clear from this account that the applicant, aside from having lied to the police, also lied to the psychologist about what had happened.  In no sense did he lose his self-control as a result of advances made by the victim.  Mr Borenstein noted also that the applicant ""denies any premeditation with regards to the behaviour which brings him before the Court"".  The agreed facts make it clear that the applicant anticipated at least that some kind of sexual activity would occur, as is shown by his request to close the curtains of the unit as soon as he entered.  He said nothing to Mr Borenstein about the theft of the victim's house keys, telephone or cash. Nor did he tell him of the campaign of threats, in particular, the circumstances in which the victim was induced to hand over his credit cards and PIN.  The course of his conduct was nothing more than a coldly calculated process of opportunistic theft and premeditated extortion.  At no point did the applicant express any remorse either to the psychologist or to the sentencing judge for his conduct.  20The applicant, who gave evidence at the sentence proceeding, deposed that the contents of Mr Borenstein's report were true.   It is clear that what the applicant told Mr Borenstein about the circumstances of the offence cannot be reconciled with the agreed facts.  Counsel for the Crown was remiss in his duty in failing to cross-examine on the inconsistency.  Regrettably, this lackadaisical approach seems to be adopted all too often, so that judges are not given the assistance which it is the duty of counsel for the Crown to provide.  21The applicant's case was essentially that he responded to the victim as he did because of what the psychologist described as his ""history of sexual abuse and activation of dormant PTSD ... [and] sought revenge against the complainant, partly consequent to cumulative rage, the result of his initial sexual abuse never being resolved"".  22In my opinion, the link found by the psychologist between the claimed sexual abuse and the criminal behaviour of the applicant, based as it is upon the naive acceptance of the history given to him by the applicant -   despite his having been provided with the agreed facts - renders his opinion of slight, if any, utility.  23The report from the Parramatta Parole Unit describes the applicant's attitude to the offence as follows -  ""Mr Taha's attitude to the offence appeared to be one of indifference. He demonstrated little insight into the suffering of the victim whom he appeared to blame for his current predicament. ... Mr Taha displayed a lack of insight into his offending behaviour and he demonstrated no victim empathy"".  24Dealing with this issue, the learned sentencing judge said -  ""With respect to the issue of remorse, the offender ... gave evidence.  Remorse is something that can be taken into account by the Court if the offender has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and he certainly did that by his plea of guilty.  It can also be taken into account if the offender has made reparation for damage and or acknowledged any injury or loss. The offender feels sorry for himself.  He acknowledges the hurt that his actions have caused his family.  On his own evidence, and on the reports I have read, he has given no thought to the effect of his criminal and offensive behaviour ... on the complainant and apparently justifying his actions as a distorted measure of self-protection"".  25The sentencing judge referred to what she described as ""text messages"" (I think in fact a reference to the text of the intercepted telephone calls between the applicant and his friends) which were stated by her Honour to ""give the Court some insight and concern as to the offender's motives and outward aggression and his need to justify his behaviour, both to his father and to his friends"".  Her Honour's conclusion that the facts did not support a finding of remorse was inevitable.  26The evidence in relation to the so-called sexual abuse was somewhat exiguous. The following is contained in Mr Borenstein's report -  ""Mr Taha spoke of being sexually abused in year seven of high school. As part of his increased freedom he discovered girls. He formed an attraction to a young girl, who suggested they truant together, ""I took the challenge"".  They were part of a group of about ten and went to the City .... Mr Taha recalls going down a side street to urinate, ""a man came up and asked me what I was doing, he grabbed my penis and started rubbing it"".  Mr Taha was tearful and clearly agitated in recounting this event during interview.  He required some time to compose himself and appeared embarrassed, ""I was scared, I ran away"",  Mr Taha told his father of what happened, ""He bashed me, he reckoned it was my fault, he punched me for truanting"".  Mr Taha became more rebellious, with increased truanting and non-attendance. He was asked to leave school in year nine, as he barely attended, at which time he commenced work almost immediately.  Following the sexual abuse, Mr Taha suffered symptoms of post traumatic stress, in particular frequent nightmares, vigilance, fear, tearfulness and cued response to the abuse, ""If anyone came to touch me I'd get angry, my own uncle would come near me to give me a hug, I'd just run away"". Such behaviour was in marked contrast to Mr Taha's behaviour prior to being sexually abused, ""I couldn't even play touch football anymore, I couldn't let anyone touch me, later on even my own wife, if she touches me I yell, I have to be in control. Mr Taha says he is highly sensitised to being touched and reacts accordingly to any physical or boundary intrusion to which he is not compliant or in agreement with"".  27Several comments should be made in relation to this evidence.  First, the applicant's account of sensitivity or reaction to a physical approach or touching is completely at odds with the agreed facts.  Secondly, there is no corroboration of the applicant's account about the consequences of what he claimed to have happened to him.  Thirdly, the psychologist did not test this account either by raising the agreed facts with him or by adverting to those facts in his report.  Finally, even if the applicant suffered from any such condition as he claims, it plainly played no part in any of the offences which he committed, as is evident from the facts to which he himself agreed - certainly not the later calculated course of conduct, and even the initial touching did not make the applicant ""go off"".  He took $2000 because he wanted money.  28In relation to this issue the learned sentencing judge said -  ""Whilst the offender in part blames the victim for the offence for making advances to him, it is observed that the offender chose to accompany the complainant to his home. When considering factors that might properly have [been] said to have impinged on his mental state or on his mens rea there is not a great deal to take into account. However, it is submitted, with the support of an observation in the psychologist's report, that this offence was committed as a consequence of the offender's past history as a child of some sexual abuse and of approaches being made to him and the activation of what was referred to in the psychologist's report of a dormant post traumatic stress disorder condition. Whilst this factor may be relevant to an explanation for the offence occurring, and may also explain the context of the offence in terms of Mr Taha's drug use at the time, it is not a matter that will affect the assessment of objective seriousness of the offending behaviour. I accept these matters may be relevant in assessing the need for supervision and support in the context of perhaps a longer than usual parole order ... and they may also be relevant in recommending any conditions on parole...  However the Court acknowledges that there is a difference between those matters which are in reality circumstances of the offence which go to evaluation of objective seriousness and circumstances personal to the offender such as past sexual abuse or drug abuse that might explain or influence the conduct of an offender or otherwise impinge on his moral culpability but are not relevant to the evaluation of objective seriousness"".  29In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2000) 60 NSWLR 168 Spigelman CJ at [86]-[87] pointed out that some matters otherwise thought of as ""subjective"" might also bear upon a consideration of the objective seriousness of an offence.  Although it is true the notion of ""objective seriousness"" which his Honour was considering is that which is required to be assessed for the purposes of applying a standard non-parole period under Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999, it seems to me that his Honour's observations about this matter are relevant to the common law position. His Honour said -  ""[84] The sentencing case law is replete with references to objective features of the offence and subjective features of the offender. It has not hitherto been necessary to classify a factor as one or the other. It is now necessary to construe the words ""objective seriousness"" of an offence.  [85] The multiplicity of purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act ... do not suggest a narrow perspective as to the range of facts and matters that are to be regarded as ""objective"" facts and matters which may affect the judgment involved in assessing ""seriousness"". It is too narrow a perspective to confine attention to the physical acts of the offender and their effects, as those acts or effects could be observed by a bystander. The inquiry which we consider to have been intended is one that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender ...  [86] Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ""objectively"" to affect the ""seriousness"" of the offence or be personal to the offender at the time of the offence will become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness) and mental illness or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender' s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected ... such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence.  [87] Questions of degree and remoteness arise which will need to be developed in the case law.  There are potential areas of overlap.  For example, impaired mental or intellectual functioning can go to either, or both the seriousness of the offence and punishment, so far as deterrence is concerned.""  30With respect, there appears to be some confusion in the passage set out above from the sentencing judge's reasons for sentence, since her Honour seems to accept that past sexual abuse or drug abuse ""might explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on his moral culpability"" and hence were relevant to the issue of punishment but, on the other hand, states, in effect, that they were relevant only in respect of assessing the need for supervision and the possible variation of the statutory ratio between the overall sentence and the term of parole stipulated in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999.  At the same time, as is clear from the opinions I have above expressed, her Honour was plainly right to say in respect of these matters that there was not a great deal to take into account.  The applicant's criminal record  31This commences in September 2002 with fines for various driving offences with further fines for such offences imposed in February 2004, November 2005, July 2006, August 2008, November 2008 and March 2009. In June 2006 the applicant was convicted on two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was fined $1000 and $750. Perhaps more significantly, on 5 February 2007 the applicant was convicted on 11 counts of obtaining money by deception and was placed on a s9 bond for 2 years. The present offences, also involving significant dishonesty, were committed whilst he was subject to this bond. The applicant gave evidence that he had a significant problem with drug abuse and, as her Honour found, anxiety, depression and the use of medication. So far as prospects of rehabilitation are concerned, the sentencing judge concluded that only a guarded finding could be made. In light of the applicant's dishonesty to the psychologist and his continuing attempts to rationalise his offending, this conclusion is, if anything, generous.  Other matters  32The sentencing judge concluded, in respect of planning, that ""over a period of time the offender took a series of decisions, each of which not terribly well planned, but each requiring and assuming a certain compliance and vulnerability of the victim's position.  Her Honour added -  ""The offender behaved as a bully, in effect terrorising the complainant, and apparently being confident that due to the complainant's fear he would continue to hand over money. The planning, as well as the vulnerability of the complainant, have not been taken into account as significantly aggravating circumstances but they are relevant and I mention them simply in the context of the overall offending behaviour. They also give the court some insight into why and in what context this offender shows little empathy for the complainant and the context of his behaviour over the two weeks of this very serious offending"".  The first ground of appeal  33In respect of the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, the sentencing judge said -  ""... I propose to allow a discount of 10% on the sentence that would have otherwise been appropriate had the matter proceeded to trial. I take into account the utilitarian value of the plea noting that there was apparently a strong Crown case. The plea of guilty and the context of this case can also be a reflection of contrition and I accept it as such"".  34Counsel for the applicant contends that her Honour erred in assessing the utilitarian value of the plea by reference in part to the strength of the Crown case.  Having regard to the lateness of the plea it could not be argued that any higher discount could be granted, so that the possibility that her Honour reduced a possibly higher starting point because of the strength of the Crown case is immaterial.  I note that, although the reasons for sentence are said to have been revised it seems to me very likely that the passage set out above contains errors of punctuation. In my view, it is very likely that her Honour in fact said -  ""I take into account the utilitarian value of the pleas. Noting that there was apparently a strong Crown case, the plea of guilty and [I think an error for ""in""] the context of this case can also be a reflection of contrition and I accept it as such"".  35So read, the passage is both unremarkable and correct, although I would not, with respect, have found that the applicant had demonstrated any contrition, having regard to his attempted dishonest rationalisation of the offences, which persisted during the sentence hearing, and his failure to express any degree of remorse.  There is no merit in this ground of appeal.  The second ground of appeal  36The error identified in the second ground of appeal is that the offences ""involved actual or threatened violence"" a feature mentioned in s 21A(2)(c) of the Sentencing Act and it was an error to regard the threat to use a non-existent weapon as an aggravating feature.  Her Honour observed that robbery ""frequently and almost always has some violence or threat attached to it"" and that, so far as ""the demand property with menaces"" went, there was a threatened use of violence, again the threat being an element of the offence"".  No issue is taken with the correctness of this passage.  Counsel, however, points to the following paragraph -  ""In relation to use of a weapon, the use or threatened use of a weapon was involved in relation to the demand property with menaces and in relation to the robbery. It is again a feature in relation to the robbery offence that a weapon is often used. It is not necessary for the Court to make a finding that there was actually a weapon used and it is the threat that the Court is taken into account as the aggravating feature"".  37Counsel for the applicant points out that the applicant was not charged with armed robbery and the agreed facts did not suggest that he in fact had a weapon but, rather, that he pretended to have a weapon.  Counsel submits, rightly in my view, that it would constitute double counting, when sentencing for the offence of robbery, to take into account the actual or threatened use of violence as an additional aggravating feature since it is implicit in the offence itself that actual or threatened violence has occurred.  Although the Crown agreed that there was error in treating the threat of violence as an aggravating feature, I do not think that this is what her Honour did.  The nature of the threat is material and can be an aggravating feature of greater or lesser significance depending on the circumstances.  Her Honour was simply pointing out, in effect, that the applicant had made a threat to use a weapon and this was an aggravating feature within s21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  In my view, this in not an error, although I would accept that it does not add much to the seriousness of the offence.  The third ground of appeal  38So far as the relevance of sexual abuse as a child is concerned, I do not think that it is a separate or distinct class of mitigation, though I accept that in some cases it might lead to a relevant psychological condition or explain, at least in part, why particular offences occurred.  Here, although it must be accepted in the applicant's favour, having regard to the prosecution's failure to place this matter in issue, that it had some effect on his conduct, for the reasons I have already given, it could not be realistically regarded as significant except as a rationalisation used by the applicant in an attempt to avoid dealing with the serious offences that he committed.  Conclusion  39I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.   **********

		06 July 2011",2011-07-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757347,Kumar v R [2011] NSWCCA 139,"Judgment  1HODGSON JA :  I agree with Adams J.  2ADAMS J :  Introduction  3On 11 March 2009 the applicant was found guilty following trial by jury in the District Court of the following offences:  (a) count 1 -  on or about 1 April 2008, using a carriage service to access child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth); and  (b) count 2 -  between 7 August 2006 and 15 May 2008 possessing child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  4The maximum penalty prescribed for the count 1 offence is imprisonment for 10 years and for the count 2 offence imprisonment for 5 years.  In 2009, after commission of these offences, the maximum penalty for the count 2 offence was increased from 5 years to 10 years imprisonment. Sentence hearings were conducted on 7 May and 19 June 2009.  For the purposes of sentencing, the Crown relied on the evidence adduced in the trial and tendered a pre-sentence report, which attached a psychological pre-sentence assessment and a criminal history. The applicant, who had not given evidence at the trial, did not give evidence at the sentence hearings. He tendered references from his wife and daughter and documents relating to loss of employment.  On 17 July 2009 the applicant was sentenced -  (a) in respect of count 1, to 5 years imprisonment commencing on 11 March 2009 with a non-parole period of 3 years; and  (b) in respect of count 2, to 4 years imprisonment commencing on 11 March 2011 with a non-parole period of 2 years.  5The effective head sentence was six years imprisonment commencing on 11 March 2009 with an effective non-parole period of four years.  6The applicant appeals from these sentences, relying on the following grounds of appeal -  (1) the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence which gave ""great weight"" to the need to deter others from pleading not guilty; and  (2) the sentence is manifestly excessive.  7The first ground of appeal did not reflect with complete accuracy the substance of the complaint. The passage in the learned sentencing judge's reasons to which the applicant pointed, in particular, as demonstrative of significant error is as follows -  ""The sentences which I impose as will be seen give greater weight to general deterrence, the need to deter others from engaging in this conduct and particularly the need to deter others from making false claims that they did not engage in it when they did, and of course the principles of retribution fixing an appropriate sentence for the seriousness of the offences.""  8At trial the defence argued that the prosecution had not established that it was the applicant who downloaded the relevant material and accessed it, since it had not excluded the reasonable possibility that others, including in particular the applicant's daughter, could have done so.  The applicant did not give evidence at any stage in the proceedings and there was no positive evidence implicating his daughter (or anyone else, for that matter).   Following conviction, the applicant was interviewed by a psychologist employed by the Department of Corrective Services.  The psychologist reported that the applicant, denying his guilt, said that his daughter, who was 14 at the time, had confessed to downloading the child pornography.  The report was tendered by the Crown in the sentence proceedings as an annexure to the Probation and Parole pre-sentence report.  It disclosed that the applicant made the same claim to the Probation and Parole officer.  Counsel for the applicant did not rely on that matter in his submissions on sentence.  9The gravamen of this ground of appeal, more correctly put, is not that the applicant was punished for pleading not guilty but that the sentencing judge erred by taking into account, in addition to the usual relevant matters, ""the need to deter others from making false claims that they did not ... [commit the crimes] when they did"".  The facts  10The nature of the material in question was described in his Honour's reasons for sentence and is not the subject of controversy. The following is largely taken from that account.  11The great majority of the images accessed by the applicant were of very young naked girls displayed in erotic poses.  However, there were also images of men apparently in their forties having penile vaginal intercourse with young girls, possibly aged 8 or 9 years.  There were a few images of torture.  There were many images involving ejaculation by a man on the body of a young girl, the rubbing of semen on the body of a girl near her vaginal opening and other ""disgusting"" material.  Both still pictures and videos were downloaded. The young girls appeared to be very slightly built and not well nourished. The 86 images which were accessed on 1 April 2008 and the subject of the first count were mostly of young naked girls. Many of the images focussed on their genital area, each of the girls posing in a sexually suggestive manner, exposing their genitalia, touching themselves, dancing, dressing and undressing. There were images of girls licking and holding adult penises, being ejaculated on and having their genital area touched by adult males. A number of the images were of girls being vaginally penetrated by adult penises, performing oral sex on adult males and being digitally penetrated by them. There was also an image of a girl between 8 and 10 years of age bound with rope, kneeling on a bed ""looking very, very much in distress"" while on the same bed an adult male was having sex with another child next to her.  12His Honour also noted that in addition to the images which were the subject of the first count there were 12,000 other images and 11 video movies located on the applicant's computer hard drive which were admitted for tendency purposes. His Honour said that it was not necessary to discuss the exact detail of these images, other than to say that they contained much the same material as the type of image he had already described. His Honour does not expressly state that he did not take this material into account in sentencing the applicant but his Honour's reference to the purpose for which they were admitted justifies the inference, as it seems to me, that his Honour (with respect rightly) did not take them into account. May I, with respect, suggest that where other criminality is referred to than that for which an offender is being sentenced, it is desirable to explicitly state the reason for which it is mentioned in order to avoid any potential ambiguity.  13It appears that material was first looked at by the applicant while browsing the internet (this being recorded on the computer hard drive) and he subsequently saved particular images onto the USB drive, undertaking this process over a period of about a year and nine months.  The first image was found on 8 August 2006 and the latest 1 May 2008.  Possession of these images formed the basis of the second count.  Of the 118 images found on the drive some were of children as young as two while others were of children some four and five years old.  Many of them involved what his Honour described as ""straight out criminal activity by males on these young children"".  One involved a girl who was obviously being tortured in some way, her wrists taped to her ankles and gaffer tape over her mouth.  She lay on a bed with underwear cut.  These were all still pictures.  There are also four video films of digital and penile penetration of girls under the age of ten.  His Honour found that what he described as ""quite large numbers"" of different children were involved, though sometimes the same child was involved repeatedly.  14There is no evidence that the applicant communicated with anyone else to share the material or that he sought from other persons to share their material.  15The claims made by the applicant as to his daughter's responsibility were relevant only to the question of the applicant's remorse and contrition, prospects of rehabilitation and the weight to be given to the element of personal deterrence.  The jury verdicts required that the applicant be sentenced on the basis that the applicant had intentionally committed the offences in both counts of the indictment and it was no part of the judge's function to consider the matter.  To do so gives the unfortunate impression that the jury's verdicts required the judge's approval before they could be given their full effect.  The subjective features  16The following is taken from the sentencing judge's reasons for sentence. The offender was born in Fiji and is the eldest of five children.  He lived in a rural community and was brought up in poor circumstances.  He came to Australia in 1983 on a student visa and married in 1988.  He has a daughter who was 15 years of age as at the date of sentence.  He became an Australian citizen in June 1994.  He has done some tertiary study and, at the time of his arrest, and up until the time of his conviction, was working in an accounts section of a major public hospital.  He was undertaking a second job as a cleaner at night to assist with payments on his home mortgage.  The applicant told a probation officer that he owed $800,000 for his home and had other large debts.  He was by far the major provider of resources for his family, his wife having a part-time cleaning job and his daughter being at school. He was 50 years of age at the date of sentence.  Ground of appeal 1  17The Judge's reasons for sentence discuss in detail the applicant's response to the charges and its significance.  They commence with the observation that, so far as counsel were able to inform him and as far as his own research extended, the applicant was the first person found with this material on his hard drive or on a computer of which he had control to plead not guilty, every case located involving a guilty plea.  His Honour then discussed the evidence at trial at some length and the approach taken by defence counsel of suggesting that the police had not investigated the possibility that the applicant's brother, neighbours or daughter had downloaded and viewed the material rather than the applicant.  Referring to the probation and psychologist's reports, his Honour said the applicant had ""repeated his allegations to those people that his daughter was the one who downloaded the material, and has explained to them that this arose because he and his wife were not able to tell her about normal sexual matters and she just did this without his knowledge"".   He concluded -  ""I would reject this claim by him as an utterly false claim and one that shows him to be a dishonest and rather callous individual.  To blame a daughter for his own offences is something which in my view is utterly unacceptable"".   If I may say so with respect, this observation was entirely just.  However, the matter did not end there.  The issue raised on the appeal is the way in which the judge applied this conclusion in assessing the sentence to be imposed.  18Following the conclusion about the applicant's blaming his daughter, the judge returned to the other cases which had been brought to his attention.  His Honour noted that in many cases the offenders were in possession of very large numbers of images, many involving large numbers of torture videos, but that in every case the persons charged pleaded guilty and in most cases ""claimed that they would seek to do something about the problem of accessing child pornography"".   His Honour said that in many cases psychiatric evidence was produced of offenders undergoing rehabilitation treatment or a willingness to do so and contrasted this with the case of the applicant who ""continues to say he did not do anything and who will not be given the access to any such programs in goal because he continues to deny doing anything at all"".  19Noting that the majority of images downloaded by the applicant did not fall into the category of torture or sexual activity between adults and children, although some of them did, his Honour continued -  ""This makes them different ... to many of the cases to which I have been referred.  However, what makes his case worse than all their cases is his adamant refusal to admit that he has done anything and his continuing to blame his daughter""  20Put in other words, despite the significantly more serious objective circumstances of the other cases, the applicant's case was worse because he continued to deny his guilt and falsely blamed his daughter.  21His Honour concluded with the following passage, which I set out again for convenience of reference -  ""The sentences which I impose as will be seen give greater weight to general deterrence, the need to deter others from engaging in this conduct and particularly the need to deter others from making false claims that they did not engage in it when they did, and of course the principles of retribution fixing an appropriate sentence for the seriousness of the offences"".  [Emphasis added.]  22In this Court, the Crown prosecutor conceded that, if the sentencing judge expressed the view ""that the conduct of the defence at trial was an aggravating feature which increased the sentence, then he would have fallen into serious error"".   In my view, although the sentencing judge referred to the conduct of the defence, the false claims which he was concerned to deter were of the type made by the applicant after he was convicted.  His Honour had agreed during submissions that the defence conducted at the trial was not aggravating but rather deprived him of various mitigating circumstances and commented that the applicant had ""defended the case as he [was] entitled to"".  The reference to the course of the defence simply gave a context for the evidence which his Honour discussed.  However, in my respectful view, the sentencing judge plainly regarded the ""claims"" made to the psychologist and the probation officer as being in a quite different category which, it appears his Honour thought, were required to be refuted by reference to the evidence at trial.  23It seems to me that, in determining Ground 1, it makes no difference in point of principle whether it could be said that the applicant was punished additionally because of the defence he ran at trial or his subsequent claims of innocence in which he blamed his daughter.  The fact is that, in this case, sentencing error as explained in paragraph [22] has been made out. Whilst the continuation of the applicant's claims of innocence were relevant to the subjective factors of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation, they were in no sense aggravating features of the offences.  The need to deter others from making ""false claims"" of innocence is not and never has been a function of sentencing.  It cannot be an element of general deterrence: that function of sentencing is directed to deterring the commission by others of the offence in question.  And, because it is not an offence, it cannot be justified by the need to prevent such false claims by the offender being made in the future.  24Since the reasons for sentence make it clear that this feature significantly affected the sentence which was imposed it is unnecessary to consider the second ground of appeal as this Court is at all events obliged to re-sentence the applicant unless, of course, no lesser sentence is warranted (s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912).  Re-sentencing  25The objective and subjective features of the case have already been set out.  Making due allowance for the facts that the applicant has not pleaded guilty and told both the psychologist and the probation officer that his daughter was responsible for the offences, it seems to me that some assistance is obtained by examining other cases dealing with these offences.  26It may be worth stating, in parenthesis, that the case presented on the applicant's behalf at the sentencing proceedings was not that the applicant was innocent or that his daughter was responsible.  At no stage did the applicant's solicitor make such a submission, although he acknowledged that this was claimed by his client in the reports tendered by the prosecution.  27The fact that the applicant continued (and presumably continues) to deny his guilt, however, is material on the issues of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation.  If I may say so, with respect, a useful discussion of this point is contained in the judgment of Johnson J (the other members of the bench agreeing) in Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 -  ""[47] In R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 169-170 [41], the Court of Criminal Appeal observed that remorse will be a major factor in determining whether an offender is unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation and that, without true remorse, it is difficult to see how either finding could be made.  Considerations of this type were clearly at the forefront of the sentencing Judge's thinking on this issue.  [48] This Court has observed that there can be rehabilitation without confession, and that offenders found guilty after trial are not to be automatically deprived of a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation unless they acknowledge their guilt: Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 at [65]. In a different context, it has been said that a medical practitioner who has been deregistered because of proven sexual misconduct is not required to confess before he is reinstated, although continuing vigorous challenge to clearly established guilt may be indicative of continuing unfitness: Zaidi v Health Care Complaints Commission (1998) 44 NSWLR 82 at 100. Similar considerations arise where release on parole is being considered for a sex offender who denies guilt or refuses to undertake a custodial treatment programme: DCU v State Parole Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 526 at [46]-[55], [66]-[67]; Lee v State Parole Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 1225 at [59]-[64]"".   28I think it is also worth noting that genuine remorse and contrition are of themselves significant features militating in favour of mitigation of punishment and form part of the factual elements influencing the instinctive synthesis of all the relevant matters which lead to the ultimate assessment of the appropriate level of sentence.  Of course the influence of this factor is, as is the case with all the other relevant considerations, incommensurable but, as it seems to me, to a greater or lesser extent depending on all the other facts, genuine remorse and contrition should play a role in determining the appropriate level of punishment and are not limited to the question of rehabilitation.  29Where a lack of remorse arises from a refusal to accept that the crime was morally wrong, this may well justify the conclusion that an offender might be likely to offend again.  On the other hand, where it is essentially a refusal to admit guilt, the lack of remorse does not - at least taken alone - carry this implication though it might (depending on all the circumstances) prevent a positive finding that the offender is likely not to re-offend.  This is a question to be determined by realistic common sense in each particular case and cannot be a matter of legal principle.  30In this case, there is no basis for concluding that the applicant regards the offences as lacking a significant level of moral turpitude.  He has not suggested in any way that the conduct alleged was innocent, only that he did not undertake it.  Indeed, the extreme course of denying his guilt by blaming his daughter is to my mind some evidence that, at least, he acknowledges not only the illegality of the conduct but the significant moral shame which its commission engenders and which he is not prepared to accept.  Furthermore, the utility of punishment as deterring re-offending should not be discounted.  Its very justification depends upon acceptance -  as accords at all events with common sense - that persons will be deterred from repeating their offences by the punishment which they have undergone and which they will suffer again if they re-offend.  31The psychological assessment, made in the knowledge of the applicant's denials of guilt, was that he falls within the low risk group for committing further child pornography offences, applying static actuarial, individual dynamic and stable risk assessments.  It is not necessary to set out the reasoning that justified this opinion.  It is sufficient to say that it is based upon a widely accepted methodology that, with all its inherent shortcomings, gives rise to conclusions significantly more useful than a mere hunch or uninformed intuition.  Of course, statistical analyses are scarcely prescriptive of the actual risk in an individual case.  Nevertheless, they can usefully inform the consideration of the risk of re-offending by an individual.  32In this case, the psychologist's assessment that individual's with the applicant's characteristics are at low risk of re-offending is apparently accepted by the author of the pre-sentence report.  33The psychologist recommended that, should the Court impose a non-custodial sentence, the applicant should be referred to a sex offender program in the community and pointed to that operated by the Forensic Psychology Service within the department of Corrective Services.  Since a non-custodial sentence is out of the question, it is relevant to consider the availability of similar treatment in the prison context.  Such programs are available at Long Bay Correctional Centre and, presumably, elsewhere but, since the applicant maintains his innocence, it appears from the Probation and Parole report that, as at 7 May 2009, he was ineligible. The report noted that a future program targeted at similar offenders is proposed but that, as at the date of the report, it was not known when this program was likely to commence.  In the course of dealing with orders for continuing detention of sex offenders, I have been made aware that such programs are now available.  Given the non-controversial character of this evidence it seems to me, at least, that this Court should not proceed upon the basis that the applicant would not be eligible for sex offender programs in the prison situation.  34In my view the applicant should be sentenced upon the basis that although his criminality is not mitigated by the presence of remorse and contrition, he is at a low risk of re-offending and no particular weight should be given, out of the ordinary, to the aspect of personal deterrence.  35On the question of objective gravity, I should first mention the submission of the Crown that the increase after the applicant's offences of the maximum penalty for possession of child pornography from five to ten years' imprisonment is ""broadly relevant to the seriousness of these offences and the need for a strong deterrent"".  In my view, this increase of the maximum penalty is not material to sentencing the applicant.  He must be sentenced on the basis that at the time he committed the offence the maximum sentence did in fact reflect its seriousness.  36So far as the cases go, a useful starting point is the judgment of Johnson J (the other members of the Court agreeing) in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370.  In that case the applicant appealed from a sentence imposed for the offence of importation of child pornography contrary to s 233BAB(5) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 10 years or a fine not exceeding $275,000 or both.  The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months with a recognisance release order for his release after 12 months subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The applicant had brought a number of CDs into Australia and was apprehended at the airport.  One of the CDs contained 16 videos between 5 and 39 seconds long containing images of young boys engaged in sexual acts with adult males or each other, involving acts of oral and anal penetration and masturbation.  Another CD contained 601 still images of young boys and girls engaged in sexual acts with adult males and females and/or each other, the boys appearing to range in age from 6 to 16 years with the majority aged between 8 and 11 years whilst the girls appeared to range in age between 6 and 14 years. The sentencing judge found (and it was not controversial) that the majority of the children were pre-pubescent, some being so young that they could not really have understood the manner of their exploitation.  Full sexual penetration was depicted in many instances and, in at least one instance, the child displayed obvious and extreme pain.  It was apparent also that the children were from extremely disadvantaged situations, looking thin and emaciated and probably without anyone to care for them.   It is probable that they were deliberately targeted on this account.  37One of the grounds of appeal was that the sentencing judge had given only limited weight to the applicant's prior good character.  Johnson J noted (at [63]) that it is apparently a common feature of offences of this type that ""the offender is otherwise of good character, is in good employment and of sound reputation"" and added (at [64]) that there was a foundation for the approach that less weight should be attached to evidence of this kind in these cases, general deterrence being the ""paramount consideration"" in sentencing for this class of offence (citing R v Assheton (2002) 132 A Crim R 237).  His Honour, in dealing with the ground of appeal that the sentence was manifestly excessive, set out (at [99]) the following factors, extracted from the authorities -  ""(a) the nature and content of the pornographic material - including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed ;  (b) the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender;  (c) whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of sale or further distribution;  (d) whether the offender will profit from the offence.  It might be worth noting, however, that the number of images as such may not be the real point. In a case of possession of child pornography for personal use only, the significance of quantity lies more in the number of different children who are depicted and thereby victimised.""  38Summarising the position, Johnson J said -  ""[100] Whether an offence of importation of child pornography calls for a full-time custodial sentence will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular offence and offender. The Applicant's offence was objectively serious. This is not a victimless crime. The applicant took advantage of the sexual exploitation of children. This reflects a substantial level of moral turpitude. General deterrence is a paramount consideration and specific deterrence was a significant factor in the Applicant's case.""  39There was evidence of a relevant psychiatric condition, but this was discounted by the sentencing judge as a mitigating factor.  Johnson J observed that personal deterrence was significant in the case given the applicant's implausible explanation for his conduct and his lack of insight; nor had remorse or condition been demonstrated.  40In R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 Simpson J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) made the following general observations about the character of these offences which, with respect, are correct and useful -  ""[41] In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. Often this is in undeveloped or disadvantaged countries that lack the resources to provide adequate child protection mechanisms. The damage done to the children may be, and often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse, and upon the poverty of the children the subject of the material.  [42] What makes the crime callous is not just that it exploits and abuses children; it is callous because, each time the material is viewed, the offender is reminded of and confronted with obvious pictorial evidence of that exploitation and abuse, and the degradation it causes.  [43] And every occasion on which a child pornography site is accessed (or when such material is accessed by any means at all) provides further encouragement to expand their activities to those who create and purvey the material.  [44] It is for that reason that this is a crime in respect of which general deterrence is of particular significance.""  (I should mention that it is common for non-pornographic sites to contain links to other sites dealing with similar or related matters and also display advertising and offer material for sale, so that the number of hits the initial site receives gives some economic advantage to the operator.  It would be naive to suppose that similar considerations do not apply to child pornography sites.  Accordingly, even where a person accesses a site and downloads images without payment, that access rewards the operator of the site and thus encourages the trade.)  41The Crown appealed from the imposition of a s9 bond for one count under s91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 involving the possession of two hard copy images of child pornography (erotic posing), a computer disc with 76 images of sexual activity between children, two folders on the hard drive containing similar images and one movie file of six minutes of a child masturbating.  There was a strong case that the respondent's commitment to rehabilitation was sincere and effective. The appeal was upheld and the respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months with a balance of term of 18 months.  42In Saddler v R [2009] NSWCCA 83 the offender had pleaded guilty to three counts of possessing child pornography with four further charges taken into account on a Form 1.  He was found in possession of just under 19,000 image files, 300 movie files and just over 50 archive files containing images of children ranging in age from less than 12 months to early teens and ranging in classification on the COPINE scale from 1 to 10 (level 10, the most serious category, involving pain or sex with animals). Photographs included images of young children including babies performing sexual acts, of them being tied up, of them being penetrated by objects and of them performing sexual acts with animals.  Video files contained movies of male and female children of various ages performing sexual acts with adults and other children.  Further searches of the offender's premises led to the discovery of an external hard drive containing well in excess of 15,000 image files, 416 movie files and 24 archive photographs of child pornographic material, the images ranging from level 1 to level 10 on the COPINE scale.  Almost 17,000 images were found on a laptop with images rated from level 1 to level 9 on the COPINE scale, together with a number of DVDs and CDs including well over 1,000 files ranging from level 5 to level 10 on the scale.  The ages of the children involved ranged from below 12 months to teenagers.  In all, thousands of children appeared in the more than 45,000 images and about 700 child pornography movies which the applicant had in his possession.  43Buddin J referred to Gent (supra), Power v DPP (NSWDC, unreported, 19 July 2007), Mouscas [2008] NSWCCA 181, R v Leonard [2008] NSWDC 211, R v Elliott [2008] NSWDC 238 and R v Jones [2009] NSWDC 8.  His Honour (the other members of the Court agreeing) concluded at [62] -  ""Even allowing for the fact that the applicant had the material in his possession solely for his own private use, the total number of images, the ages of the children involved and the sheer depravity of what was displayed in the images compel the conclusion that these offences are properly to be regarded as falling into the upper echelons of this kind of offending. The analysis of other comparable cases serves to confirm that categorisation"".  44The offender had only limited insight into the seriousness of his offences and his account as to how he had come into possession of the material was ""inherently unbelievable"".  There was no finding that the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation.  45The sentence of a total of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years and six months was reduced to an effective sentence of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and nine months.  46I have set out the objective facts in Saddler in some detail to demonstrate that the opinion expressed by the sentencing judge that the applicant's case is worse than all of the cases to which he had been referred (including Saddler ) is, with respect, untenable.  47It will have been seen that, in respect of the second count, the applicant was sentenced to a term of 4 years imprisonment, as against a maximum penalty of 5 years.  Whilst, of course, reasonable minds can reasonably differ about the relative seriousness of an offence, I do not see, with respect, how the criminality demonstrated in respect of this count extended to somewhere near a case falling in the worst category.  48As will be seen from the following proposed sentences, I have concluded that some measure of accumulation is appropriate, having regard to the different material involved in each count.  I have allowed special circumstances only to the extent necessary to reflect the stipulated ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, recognising of course that that provision does not apply to Commonwealth offences.  However, in all the circumstances, it seems to me that, on general principles, this ratio should apply to the sentences to be served by this applicant.  49Accordingly, I propose the following orders -  (i) the time for lodging the notice of appeal is extended to 1 November 2010;  (ii) leave to appeal is granted; the sentences imposed on the appellant are quashed;  (iii) in respect of count 2 the applicant is sentenced to 2 years imprisonment commencing 11 March 2009 and ending on 10 March 2011 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 11 March 2009 and ending on 10 September 2010; and  (iv) in respect of count 1 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 11 March 2010 and ending on 10 March 2013 with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 11 March 2010 and ending on 10 March 2012.  50The overall effective sentence is therefore four years with a non-parole period of three years.  51HALL J : I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Adams J.   **********

2757363,R v Alen MORADIAN [2011] NSWDC 130,"SENTENCE 

1Alen Moradian, the offender, stands for sentence having pleaded guilty to between 1 October 2006 and 30 December 2006 importing more than the commercial quantity of the drug cocaine pursuant to s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and supplying a large commercial quantity of the imported drug cocaine between 1 October 2006 and 25 July 2007 pursuant to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 

2The charges result from a major New South Wales Police and Crime Commission investigation into cocaine importation, drug supply and illicit cash and firearm possession known as Operation Schoale. 

3For both Federal and State drug offences there are structural sentencing regimes with maximum penalties denoted by the quantity of drug imported or supplied. The maximum penalty for importing more than two kilograms of pure cocaine is life imprisonment and/or a substantial fine. The maximum penalty for supplying more than one kilogram of cocaine is life imprisonment and/or a substantial fine. There is also a standard non-parole period of fifteen years imprisonment. Those maximum penalties are an important indicator of the seriousness with which the Parliaments, on behalf of the community, view offences such as this. 

4The offender also asks that in relation to the supply count I take into account on a Form 1 an offence of knowingly deal in the proceeds of crime in the sum of $1,624,475.15 and nine offences pursuant to the Road Transport (Drivers Licensing) Act 1998 (NSW). The driver licensing offences involve four matters of drive while disqualified, two of learner not accompanied by a driver and three of unlicensed for the class of driving. I will take these matters into account. 

Agreed facts or facts not in dispute 

5Marius Rusu and Zolten Mato were also cocaine importers. They are presently serving sentences of twenty-nine years nine months and thirty years three months respectively after being convicted after a jury trial of conspiring to import over two hundred kilograms of cocaine and related offences. Mr T, who worked for an international freight handling business, assisted them. His identity, by operation of law, cannot be revealed. The offender and his partner, who has yet to come to trial, heard of this operation. They hired a private inquiry agent to track Mr T down. 

6On 27 October 2006 the offender and his partner paid Mr T a visit at his home. The visit so concerned Mr T's wife that she called the police. The two men left before the police arrived leaving $500,000 with Mr T as ""a gesture of goodwill"". Further meetings took place during which an illicit business proposition was put whereby Mr T would facilitate the importation of cocaine by providing relevant forged documents and the services of the company he worked for. Mr T advised the offender and his partner that the maximum weight of any imported package should be one hundred kilograms, including legitimate goods shipped with it. He then received $3,500 for shipping costs and, later, $1 million in cash as a fee for his services. The offenders then organised for $1 million AUD to be sent to the United States in part payment for the shipment. 

7In December 2006 the package arrived in Australia as a shipment labelled ""Concrete blades"". It followed the same procedure adopted by Mr T, Mato and Rusu with their conspiracy. The package the subject of the shipment had a gross weight of three hundred and sixty-seven kilograms. After the package had cleared Customs Mr T took it to Homebush. The offender met him there and directed him to a townhouse at Newington. There the package was unpacked. The package contained: a pallet, packing material, a quantity of steel concrete-cutting saw blades, and a large quantity of cocaine in sealed plastic blocks with a rearing horse brand. Each block of cocaine weighed about one kilogram. The precise quantity of cocaine imported and its purity is in dispute. 

Factual dispute 

8On 13 February 2007 police executed the search warrant in another unit in Newington occupied by a John Youkhana. He had also occupied the flat at Newington to which Mr T delivered the cocaine. The offender's partner rented both premises and had been seen at both premises. On execution of the warrant police found a packing carton with a label from Mr T's shipping company and fifty concrete-cutting saw blades, weighing ninety-six kilograms in total. 

9John Youkhana has been sentenced for supplying cocaine and firearms offences uncovered by Operation Schoale. He is presently serving a total sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years and nine months. 

10On 20 December 2006 Mr T purchased one of the blocks of cocaine taken from the larger package. He gave evidence at Mato and Rusu's court proceedings (Exhibit A10(i)-(iv)). He said he was unable to observe the whole unpacking process and thus could not say how much cocaine was actually imported. He said that the two offenders broke his rule about an absolutely one hundred kilogram limit. 

11Mr T described his role in the delivery and unpacking (Exhibit A10(ii)). In the transcript of 26 May 2010 he said he counted twenty-two to twenty-five blocks similar to the one he purchased being taken into the premises as the first load. He said he saw six to ten blocks included in a second load, and as I read the transcript of 26 May at page 50, a third load and a fourth load were taken into the unit before he left. The box was still being unpacked when he left. He said he saw nothing other than the box, packing, saw blades, pallet and the cocaine blocks. 

12On 27 May 2010 (Exhibit A1(iii)) Mr T reiterated that he had no idea how much cocaine was in the parcel but said he had estimated there were at least fifty blocks. He said the block he bought weighed about one kilogram. Pallets weigh up to twelve kilograms (Exhibit 9(x)). 

13Cocaine ranging in purity from sixty-one per cent to eighty-two per cent was seized from direct associates of the offender at the time the search warrants were executed. These associates include John Youkhana and Jason Johnson. Johnson is presently serving a total sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years and nine months for supplying cocaine and firearms offences uncovered by Operation Schoale. It is reasonable to assume that some of this cocaine came from the December 2006 importation. 

14The Crown submit that all of the above evidence and evidence relating to the amount of cash money available to the offender and cocaine sold by him establishes that at least two hundred kilograms gross of cocaine was imported. Two hundred kilograms at sixty-one per cent purity would yield an amount of pure cocaine weighing over one hundred and twenty kilograms. 

15The offender's wife, Natasha Youkhana, is presently facing sentence for her role in matters uncovered in Operation Schoale. These offences include knowingly dealing in the proceeds of crime amounting to over $4 million, some of which was spent on their wedding and their home at Pennant Hills. Her sister, Tanya Youkhana, is also serving a two year sentence for assisting in the hiding of over $2.7 million during the relevant period. Although both women are clearly associated with the offender he is not to be punished for their offences. 

16The defence concedes that forty kilograms of pure cocaine was imported (Agreed Facts at [43]) but say that the Crown has not met its onus to prove it was more than that amount and certainly has not met its onus to prove that it was over one hundred and twenty kilograms. 

17When I examine all of the evidence I can comfortably find beyond reasonable doubt that well over 65 one-kilogram packets yielding more than forty kilograms of pure cocaine were imported. The real question is: How much more than forty kilograms of pure cocaine was imported? 

18In making my findings I rely on the admissions made in the Agreed Facts. I accept that Mr T saw four similar loads being taken into the Newington unit (the first of which contained over 20 one-kilogram blocks) and the fact that there was obviously more cocaine in the parcel to be unpacked when he left. I also have regard to the risk taken by the offender and his partner, a risk that could only be justified if a significant amount of cocaine was imported. I also note the material in the other exhibits about the money expended in preparing for the importation, including $1.5 million to Mr T and $1 million as part payment sent to the USA. 

19The ledgers found at the offender's home at Pennant Hills on 12 March 2007 indicated an association by him with thirty-seven blocks of cocaine (Exhibit A(viii)). Ms Gray, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, submits they could, on the evidence before me, only be associated with this shipment. As she sets out in her written submissions, if the kilogram packets were retailed at $190,000, two hundred kilograms would wholesale for about $38 million and forty to sixty kilograms would wholesale for ""only"" $7.5 to $11.4 million. She suggests the $38 million figure is more consistent with the amounts of money expended. She draws my attention to the wholesale price of cocaine in America (Exhibit E) and the vast sums of money available to the offender and his family between December 2006 and his arrest in July of 2007. 

20On the other hand Mr Boulten SC, for the offender, suggests that as ""only"" $1 million was sent to the US in part payment and $1.5 million was given to Mr T the lower figure is more indicative. He argues that this is the only evidence of payment and that the sums expended by, or found with, the offender or his family could have other sources, as undoubtedly any expenditures and money received before October 2006 did. A similar subtle argument is made in relation to the ledgers: I can only take them into account if satisfied they relate to this importation. 

21I must be careful not simply to guess at a quantity. I must make this decision to the required standard on what is supported by the evidence before me. I must caution myself that the witness, Mr T, may have had reasons to downplay his involvement and over-emphasise that of others. A sustained attack on his credibility was mounted in the Mato and Rusu proceedings. 

22I infer matters of aggravation only if they are the only rational inferences available. For example, I have considered the coincidence of the false order forms being for forty-seven saw blades and the fifty saw blades found at a unit associated with the offender's partner. This indicates that the likely amount of legitimate product weighed close to one hundred kilograms, leaving over two hundred kilograms unaccounted for in packaging or pallets and, thus, inferentially cocaine. There is no reliable evidence about how many saw blades were imported in this shipment. 

23Mr Boulten stresses that what is ""likely"" does not meet the high onus placed upon the Crown. I agree, although I remain highly suspicious there were up to two hundred blocks of cocaine imported I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the shipment reached that extremely high amount. 

24After giving the benefit of the doubt to the offender the evidence before me establishes that more than 65, and up to at least 100, one-kilogram blocks of cocaine mixture were involved in the importation. I base this conclusion on the money expended and available to the offender and his direct associates, the cost of the shipment, the risks involved in over-loading the parcel, the ledgers and that what Mr T saw was only part of the shipment unloaded. This conclusion leads to an estimated pure weight of cocaine of sixty-one per cent (the most favourable figure for the offender) of a minimum of between forty to sixty kilograms of pure cocaine. 

25Even if the defence figure of forty kilograms of pure cocaine is taken as a minimum imported, this offence is one of considerable objective seriousness. The Agreed Facts at [40] note that the role of the offender is: 

""...a middle level manager of the importation enterprise. His role is a significant one in which he facilitated the financial arrangements regarding the importation in addition to taking receipt and unpacking the shipment"". 

26Care must be taken with labels such as ""middle manager"" but I accept this is an accurate summary of the offender's role, which is set out fully in the Agreed Facts summarised above. 

Supply cocaine 

27The large commercial supply involves the initial sale to Mr T of the one-kilogram packet of cocaine on 20 December 2006 for the discounted price of $90,000 and information derived from drug ledgers showing supplies to a number of persons of between three to five of the one-kilogram blocks of cocaine. The usual wholesale price was $190,000 per kilogram. 

28The supply to Mr T can be regarded as almost entirely an incident of the importation. The second part of the supply remains a substantial continuation of the serious criminal activity involved in the importation, although it was clearly related to it, given what was imported was supplied. 

29There was also evidence that a substantial quantity of cash ($760,000), stored in garbage bags, was found in the possession of the accused's wife in a car outside their premises in Pennant Hills on 25 July 2007, the day the accused was arrested. It is relied upon to support the extent of the supply operation. 

The Form 1 

30The Agreed Facts detail how the offender spent some of the profits derived from the importation and the supply charges: purchasing a car, an expensive motor cycle, sports equipment for his home, and staying in expensive hotels. The bulk of the matters dealt with in the Form 1 however relate to the money payable to Mr T for his role in the importation. 

31The proceeds of crime matter is indicative of the substantial rewards that attract people such as the offender to the illicit drug trade. The need to neutralise the incentive provided by these rewards is one rationale for the maximum penalties and severe sentences generally imposed for supply and importation offences. I am conscious that to use the Form 1 to increase the sentence for the supply offence would involve a significant degree of double-counting as this factor has already been taken into account in my assessment of the objective seriousness of both the supply offence and the importation offence. I also note that, had the matters been charged separately, there would have been total, or almost total, concurrence. 

32On 27 April 2004 the offender was disqualified from driving for three years. During the period March 2007 to June 2007, while he was under surveillance, the offender was seen to drive when he was not entitled to drive at all. He was charged with nine Road Transport (Drivers Licensing) Act 1998 (NSW) offences. These matters indicate the general disregard for society's laws but so too does the principal offence. Such matters, if dealt with separately in the Local Court, would, because of their number and nature, require custodial sentences. 

33When taking them into account on the Form 1 I must focus on the sentence for the principal offence but I can, and do, give greater weight to matters relating to personal deterrence and retribution when I formulate that principal sentence. They will also require orders for the offender's disqualification from driving for a substantial period, although that period will be subsumed by the sentences he must serve. 

Assistance 

34After his arrest, the solicitor acting on the offender's behalf contacted the New South Wales Crime Commission and arranged for the surrender of a considerable number of firearms, parts of firearms and ammunition. The weapons surrendered include: a machine gun, submachine guns, a grenade launcher, a grenade, automatic rifles, pistols and a revolver. The details are set out in Exhibits A7, D and 5. 

35These surrenders took place in dribs and drabs between September 2010 and November 2010. A further series of surrenders took place in early 2011. The solicitor gave evidence that the surrenders took place after he had conferences with the offender at the gaol. These surrenders appear to have been directed by the offender, although the solicitor said in evidence that the offender's wife was also involved as she gave him photographs of some of the weapons. Unknown ""Middle Eastern fellows"" brought the weapons to the solicitor's office and arrangements were immediately made for their surrender. 

36The offender wishes his role in the surrenders to be acknowledged and used primarily for his benefit in reduction of his sentences but also for his wife, who faces sentence for serious offences discovered during Operation Schoale. 

37Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) gives a court the power to impose a lesser penalty after having regard to the degree to which an offender has assisted in the prevention of other offences. This power is also available pursuant to the common law and is reflected in what is said in s 16 A(2)(h) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides that a court must take into account the degree to which a person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or other offences. 

38It is important to note that the offender did not speak to police at any stage. No information was provided to any authority about who had possession of the weapons before or after the arrest of the offender, nor was any information provided about any criminal activity in relation to how they were obtained, possessed or used. There was no direct assistance or co-operation in the investigation of these or other offences. There may be some indirect assistance if the weapons are traced to others via forensic investigation but, as I am presently advised, this is unlikely. No one, including the offender, should he have had anything to do with these firearms prior to his arrest, can be brought to justice. 

39The surrender of such a large number of illicitly held firearms and the removal of firearms of this type from the hands of criminals must significantly reduce the risk that they would have been involved in, and used, to commit future crimes. Sergeant Agius, when cross-examined, accepted that at this level the surrender had a substantive and substantial value. This conclusion is supported by what is set out in the reports of Professor Alpers (Exhibit 5). As Exhibit 8 indicates, the Commissioner of Police has stressed that it is the responsibility of all good citizens to ""dob in"" those who have such firearms and to take advantage of periodic amnesties to surrender them. The offender therefore seeks to have his good citizenship rewarded by a reduction in penalty. A good citizen however would simply ""dob in"" those with dangerous weapons for the community's benefit and not seek to manipulate a direct reduction in penalty, but this is perhaps asking too much of an offender facing a long sentence who seeks to gain, legitimately, an advantage that the law allows. 

40There remains a nagging suspicion that, given the amount of secreted money and weapons uncovered during Operation Schoale, the firearms were in the offender's possession prior to his arrest, but that is not a matter I can take into account against the offender as it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt. However, if he was not in control or possession of them after his arrest the only inference available is that someone else surrendered them on his behalf and the offender chose not to assist police in any further investigation of the serious crime involved in that possession. Again, that is not a matter I can take into account against the offender. 

41That said, there would have been no surrender had the offender not found himself in need of something to offer to secure a reduction of his sentence. The surrender of a large cache of very dangerous weapons on behalf of the offender remains very useful to the community and deserves appropriate reward, no matter that the offender's motivation was clearly self-interest. The question is: How is the offender to benefit when his role was to arrange for his solicitor to receive a large number of what were potentially very dangerous illicit firearms? 

42Most of the matters set out in s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act 1999 (NSW) do not apply here or can be answered negatively in respect of the offender. The assistance was limited as the authorities know nothing about who obtained or had possession of the weapons. There is nothing to indicate the surrender shows any contrition by the offender, in fact the surrender has been orchestrated to ensure that no criminal liability can attach to him. The surrender was not timely, coming first in 2010. 

43There is no evidence the offender or his family are at any risk because of the assistance he has given. There is no evidence that surrender will mean his time in custody will be served in harsher conditions than those experienced by all prisoners. He may fear that others who know of the surrender may suspect they have been exposed by his actions and want retribution. He may fear the mere fact that he has helped authorities might cause some in gaol to treat him adversely. However, as he has chosen not to speak to police, the risk to himself and others must be assessed as very low. 

44Initially and provisionally I ordered that the information in relation to the firearms be subject to non-publication orders. In the circumstances I can see no need for such an order in the future. I revoke those orders. The evidence previously the subject of those orders and the material placed in sealed envelopes is now generally available. Such is the number and nature of the weapons that it is in the public interest that there be some recognition, in stark terms, of the benefit to the community by this voluntary surrender. This is not to condone either the crimes committed by the offender or the crimes involved in the possession of the weapons prior to their surrender. 

45In the circumstances I am prepared to reduce each sentence and the effective total penalty by five per cent to accommodate and reward the assistance given. That is much lower than the figures put to me on the offender's behalf. I must however have regard to the requirement that the lesser penalties that result not be unreasonably disproportionate to the crime committed:  s 23(3) Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act 1999 (NSW). The reduction in penalty I have allowed is a real and substantial one. Each sentence has been reduced and more than fourteen months has been taken off the total sentence with a corresponding reduction in the time that must be served prior to eligibility for parole. 

The offender 

46The offender was born in Iraq in 1974 and came to Australia as a young man in 1980 (Exhibit 2). His mother gave evidence that the offender and his sister have written letters to me. I have had the benefit of reports and evidence from Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist (Exhibits 1 and 1(a)). In addition, the Crown tendered excerpts from the offender's Justice Health file (Exhibit C) and a report prepared in relation to earlier proceedings of Dr Roberts (Exhibit B17). 

47The background material indicates a loving family with problems between the offender and his father developing in his teenage years. The offender left home and finished school before his HSC. He has had an intermittent work history. There was an acrimonious marriage break-up but he now has contact with the son of that relationship. That contact is obviously marred by his present custody. 

48The offender has been in his present relationship with his second wife, Ms Natasha Youkhana, since 2005. They married in 2007. By all accounts, it is a loving and supportive relationship that, in the ordinary course, would be blessed with children: something the offender's present sentence may inhibit. 

49The offender has suffered injuries from three serious motor vehicle accidents. The Justice Health records show some continuing problems. 

50Mr Watson-Munro makes a number of claims, including significant substance abuse problems, some suicidal ideation, post-traumatic stress and ongoing psychological problems. He raises the possibility of subtle organic brain injury. None of these conclusions are supported by any sworn evidence from the offender and, in fact, they are contra-indicated by the Justice Health reports and what was said by Dr Roberts in 2003. No problems, other than alcohol abuse, are noted in the Corrective Services or Justice Health records, nor was anything about them contained in the evidence or material received from the offender or his family until the second letter from the offender tendered on 2 July 2011 (Exhibit 4). Again, that second letter was not supported by sworn evidence. 

51While I am prepared to accept the offender has had problems with alcohol abuse in the past and may have used the cocaine he sold, there is nothing to indicate that drug or alcohol abuse played any role in his offending, nor has it caused any significant problems during his time in custody. Mr Watson-Munro's conclusion merits consideration but his opinions rely on what he was told by the offender and his family. There is no sworn evidence which could allow me to find to the requisite standard that the offender has any thought disorder, nor is there anything to indicate that the sentence should be mitigated because of any recognised mental illness or disability. 

52I accept that a long period of remand where a person such as the offender faces a significant sentence would cause anyone in that position to feel anxious and depressed. This is an unfortunate incident of a criminal justice system that requires significant penalties to be imposed for offences such as these. 

53The offender has a criminal record. It in no way operates to increase the sentence. It does however mean that the leniency often given to first offenders cannot be extended here. 

54These offences occurred after the offender had been granted bail but failed to appear in this Court in 2004 to prosecute an appeal. A Bench Warrant issued. Whilst his conviction was ultimately quashed, his flaunting of the Court's Order and the conditional liberty given to him by the Court is a matter aggravating the sentences I must impose. 

55All the material before me indicates that during the period of his offending the offender sought to live outside the law, enjoying the substantial material profits and rewards available to those high up in the illicit drug trade. His motive was greed. He showed no insight into the problems that his trade caused the community, nor did he appear to pay any attention to the risks imprisonment and disgrace his conduct would bring to him or his family, particularly his wife and his sister. 

56The offender has now been in custody since 25 July 2007. His letters to me indicate that the salutary lessons harsh imprisonment and loss of liberty teaches are now being learnt. He expresses a desire to start afresh. This is confirmed by his gaol reports which indicate he is helpful, polite, courteous and compliant and having sound plans for his future (Exhibit 7). In his letter he says that he recognises the impact of his actions on his wife and his wife's family and that he was stupid and selfish. Although not the subject of sworn evidence I am prepared to accept what he said, particularly in his first letter. This letter, his co-operation, evidenced by his guilty plea and his behaviour in custody, reflect a sensible, realistic and practical approach to his present predicament. He is, it appears, at long last taking into account the consequences of his actions. 

57I accept that, at this level, he has demonstrated some remorse, although there is nothing to indicate he has any real understanding of the impact his crimes had on the general community. I accept that when he serves his sentence, his age and the impact of imprisonment on him and his family will provide sufficient incentive for him to lead a responsible and law-abiding life. He will, however, need assistance to adjust to normal community living and the longer he is supervised in the community the better his chances of success will be. 

Assessing criminality - the importation 

58I must have regard to the maximum penalty that applies to importation of more than two kilograms of pure cocaine. I must assess the criminality of the offender by reference to the nature of the enterprise and his role in it, as proved or agreed. This assessment includes my finding about the size of the importation and the offender's awareness of that size. Here, a very high commercial quantity of the drug with a correspondingly high street value was imported. 

59The offender played a senior role (characterised as middle level management) in an enterprise that was well planned and of some sophistication. His role was critical to its success. He took a degree of risk, with an expectation of large reward. His motive was personal profit and greed. 

60I note what occurred in the sentencing of Mato and Rusu (Frearson SC DCJ, unreported DCNSW 3 September 2010). Although no question of direct parity arises, there is a need to consider proportionality with the sentence. Those matters involved multiple importations totalling over two hundred kilograms of cocaine and they went to trial. Judge Frearson characterised their roles as ""principals in a sophisticated conspiracy"". Here, there was a relatively sophisticated single importation using the same methods as those used by Mato and Rusu but there was a plea of guilty, some measure of co-operation and the Crown have agreed the offender was a middle manager. 

61So far as is relevant, I must have regard to the pattern of sentencing for life offences. The Court of Criminal Appeal has reasonably set out the relevant principles for assessing the objective seriousness of importation offences and referred to a number of cases to assist judges in the exercise of their sentencing discretion: Nguyen and Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238 at [72] and DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194. The summaries in De La Rosa are very helpful but I must look to the facts as agreed or found here rather than simply make an attempt to compartmentalise this offender's crime. 

62In determining what sentence is to be imposed I must have regard to what is set out in s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Significant weight must also be given to principles relating to general deterrence, although that term is not used in s 16A. Those principles recognise that, given the difficulty of detecting offences such as this and the great social consequences that are attendant on the illicit drug trade, a court is compelled to attempt to neutralise the potential rewards by the risk of certain and severe punishment. 

Assessing criminality - the supply offence 

63I must have regard to the maximum penalty that applies to the supply of more than one kilogram of cocaine. Following any large scale illicit drug importation there is an expectation the drug imported will be supplied, however, here, the offender chose to increase his profits by acting as a wholesaler of the drug. This crime extended the course of criminal conduct by a period of six months. It was a serious example of its type involving large quantities sold for considerable reward. I find it falls squarely in the middle range of objective seriousness for offence of its type. 

64There are however reasons for departure from the standard non-parole period of fifteen years, although I am still required to have regard to that period as one of the guides to the exercise of my sentencing discretion. The reasons for departure include: the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the assistance given, and a finding that special circumstances require at least three years supervision in the community to allow the offender to adjust to normal and lawful life in the community. This is his first gaol sentence and the adjustment on release will not be easy. It is in no-one's interest that he returns to a life of crime. 

65The supply shared a critical element with the importation as the same cocaine was involved. The overlap in criminality involved means most of the objects of sentencing apply equally to this offence and the importation. Given the way I have structured the sentence the non-parole period for the supply offence has been subsumed by the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offence. I am however obliged to fix separate sentences for each offence and consider relevant New South Wales sentencing principles when fixing the sentence for this offence. 

Sentences of appropriate severity 

66The guilty pleas were entered in the Local Court. They were not early. Although timeliness is a significant factor when making an assessment of utilitarian value it is not the only measure. The Crown concede, fairly, that despite an initial delay there was a considerable degree of co-operation involved in resolving outstanding issues and that much expense and time was ultimately saved. They submit that the guilty plea should attract a twenty-five per cent reduction in the otherwise appropriate penalty as they have considerable utilitarian value and the offender has, by those guilty pleas, assisted the course of justice. I agree. 

67I accept the offender's time in custody has, and will, deter him from future crimes and that there is no longer a need to protect the community from the offender. He must however be held to account for his crimes, which must be denounced and harm done recognised. 

68Sentences, however, are not just about an offender. The Court must, particularly in matters such as this, attempt, by the harshness of the sentence, to dissuade the offender and others from seeking the financial rewards available from the illicit drug trade. 

69I have regard to the maximum penalties, which for both offences is life imprisonment. For the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) offence I note the standard non-parole period, the matters on the Form 1 and my finding of special circumstances. In particular I look to the nature and circumstances of the offences. There must be some accumulation to reflect that course of conduct, which includes both importation and sale. 

70The purposes of sentencing apply equally to both offences. It would be wrong to punish the offender twice for elements of matters that are common to both. I must however fix an appropriate sentence and non-parole period for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation and concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 

71The factors relevant to the fixing of the term of the sentence are the same as those for the fixing of the non-parole period but the weight given to them may differ. The individual and total non-parole periods must reflect the minimum period in all the circumstances of the offence the offender must spend in custody before being eligible for release. The total non-parole period must also maintain the benefits given in each sentence for the early plea and assistance. 

72Here, given my findings that rehabilitation is possible, I am not disposed to fix a total non-parole period which, by its length, would induce a feeling of hopelessness and deny any hope of a useful life to the offender after release. I accept that there is some contrition and, perhaps, some belated insight. The subjective matters allow some moderation of the sentences and the non-parole periods. They allow me to have some confidence, if only because the offender is a practical man, that a lengthy parole period (some of which must be supervised) will not be wasted on him and can operate to progress his rehabilitation. 

73Long sentences have a compounding effect: severity is not simply a product of length, severity increases at a greater rate the longer the sentence lasts. The Courts and the community should never undervalue the impact of a day in gaol, let alone a period of many years. 

74I regard the importation offence as the most serious of the two offences. Accordingly, I have structured the total sentence taking into account the relevant statutory provisions and sentencing principles for Commonwealth offences: see Hili v The Queen (2010) 85 ALJR 195. 

75""What then is an adequate punishment or what severity of sentence is appropriate to all the circumstances of the offence?"", to use the terms from s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

76Had it not been for the utilitarian value of the guilty pleas and the assistance given I would have imposed sentences of thirteen years imprisonment for the supply offence and twenty-two years for the importation, with a total sentence of twenty-four years. As sentencing should not be a strictly mathematical exercise, there have been some modest adjustments to percentages and dates to the offender's advantage. Could you please stand Mr Moradian. 

Sentence 

77Alen Moradian, in relation to the offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of cocaine you are convicted. Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I sentence you to a non-parole period of six years, to commence on 25 July 2007 and expire on 24 July 2013. There will be a parole period of three years, to commence on 25 July 2013 and expire on 24 July 2016, a total sentence of nine years. 

78In relation to the import commercial quantity of border control drugs (cocaine), you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifteen years and four months. Your sentence is to commence on 25 December 2008. I fix a non-parole period of nine years, to expire on 24 December 2017 on which date, subject to s 19AL Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), you are to be released to parole to serve a parole period of six years and four months. 

79Because driving matters are dealt with on the Form 1, I must make orders for your disqualification. As you were disqualified from driving for three years on 27 April 2004, the 25A matters are ""subsequent offences"". The minimum and automatic disqualification periods of two years thus apply for those four matters. The disqualifications should date from 25 July 2007. As to whether they become cumulative or concurrent is a matter for the RTA. 

80I must explain this sentence to you. I have fixed separate sentences for the supply and importation of nine years and fifteen years four months respectively. I have accumulated the importation sentence by a period of one year and five months and adjusted the non-parole period for the importation offence to take account of that accumulation and to preserve the effect of the penalty reductions for your plea and your assistance. I have imposed a total sentence of sixteen years and nine months of which ten years and five months must be served in prison. Subject to s 19AL of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) you will be released to parole on 24 December 2017.

		19 September 2011",2011-07-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757369,R v Ho Thien Chuong PHAM [2011] NSWDC 74,"SENTENCE 


1. I am sentencing a young man who had financial problems including a drug debt. He resorted to an illegal venture to relieve his problem. But the illegal venture which he resorted to was a crime carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 

2. The crime is called supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. It is an offence against s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. As I said, Parliament regards this crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 

3. Another indication of how serious Parliament regards this offence as being is that it has also fixed a standard non-parole period of fifteen years imprisonment for the crime. 

4. It is important for a judge in sentencing someone to briefly set out what happened to bring about the charges against the person. 

5. In this case I should add that Mr Pham has pleaded guilty to the charge and he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity which he had available to him. 

6. In June last year Australian Federal Police detected a shipment of some 240 kilograms of cocaine which had been brought into Australia from Mexico. It was located in Victoria. Police removed all the cocaine and replaced the drug with what is described as an inert substance of similar appearance. Police tracked the shipment to New South Wales. They arrested a person in New South Wales on 4 July 2010. Mr Pham was not regarded as being involved in the importation of the cocaine at all or in the transportation of the substitute into New South Wales. 

7. However on 6 July 2010 an undercover police officer contacted Mr Pham on his mobile phone. They reached an arrangement for the police officer to deliver thirty kilograms of the substitute substance for cocaine. They agreed to meet at Botany. Police were observing this transaction. They saw Mr Pham driving with another man, Mr Nguyen. The undercover police officer who was posing as the person delivering the supposed cocaine confirmed with Mr Pham that they were present. 

8. What the police saw was Mr Nguyen go to the rear of the police officer's car. Mr Nguyen spoke to the officer. Mr Pham then drove over and parked next to that car. The transaction was confirmed by an earlier arrangement. The officer opened the boot of the car. Inside were two identical large plastic bags described in the facts as "" one inside the other containing a total of thirty kilograms of the substituted cocaine in thirty, one kilogram packets ."" 

9. Mr Nguyen appeared to look inside and inspect the contents. He lifted it up and then put it back down again. He walked to the back of the car that Mr Pham was in and tapped the boot. The boot opened and Mr Nguyen returned to the other car and lifted the bag containing the thirty kilograms of substituted cocaine from the officer's car. 

10. At that stage all three men - the undercover officer who was posing as one of the criminals, Mr Nguyen and Mr Pham - were arrested. When the car that Mr Pham was in was searched police found the mobile phone which he had used to communicate with the undercover police officer. 

11. Mr Pham agreed to be interviewed by the police. He told the police that he had met a man in a coffee shop some six months before and was provided with a mobile phone and told to follow instructions and "" you will get paid "". He expected to be paid ""$1,000 per one kilo handled "". Within the week before he was arrested he received some instructions as to what to do. He was never told how many kilograms he was to collect. 

12. Asked how he got mixed up in this sort of criminal activity he answered that he "" just fell short "". By that he meant he fell short financially. When that happened he asked people around him for help. This is how he came into contact with the person who supplied him with the mobile phone and was told that he could earn money when he received instructions. He had had some employment with his brother who conducted a lawn mowing business and he was earning about $450 a week, but he needed more money than that. 

13. It was, as he acknowledged, just about the money so far as he was concerned. There was no point in not following the instructions he was given over the telephone. He was asked the obvious question about what he thought he was being paid a $1,000 a kilogram for. He said that it "" could be anything I would say or it could just be instruction "". He acknowledged that he thought it was something "" illegal "". 

14. Although he had received the mobile phone some six months beforehand, activity so far as this specific transaction was concerned had not started until about a week beforehand. There were some prior arrangements which had been cancelled. In other words the arrangement or the crime that I am sentencing him for occurred or was in the state of being prepared over about a week before Mr Pham was arrested. 

15. Another important aspect of sentencing an offender is to have regard to personal information about the person that the judge is sentencing. I have several sources for this information. Mr S Wilkinson of counsel who appeared for Mr Pham called Mr Pham's brother, Van Dung Pham. 

16. They were both born in Saigon. They are half-brothers with the same mother. They came to Australia as young men. The relationship between Mr Pham, whom I am sentencing, and his then stepfather when they moved to Australia was not good. Mr Pham's brother described the father as being bad-tempered and impatient with Mr Pham and yelling at him a lot. This affected his progress at school. It affected his ability to read and write. He found it difficult at school and the relationship with his stepfather meant that he was unable to concentrate on his studies. 

17. He ran away from home at some stage and left school in Year 8. He had some trouble in his early years and became involved with the Juvenile Justice system. But he then enrolled in TAFE and moved back home with his mother and stepfather and things were more settled. He had intermittent work. He got some shift work at Coles but the shift work left him tired and depressed and he asked to change it but it could not be changed so he left his job and was unemployed for six months. 

18. In the meantime he had married in 2007. The relationship was very good for some years but then Mr Pham lost his job and became depressed. He could not find a better job, his brother said, because of his lack of education. This affected his marriage. He became under financial pressure and his marriage became under pressure. He had borrowed apparently up to $15,000. He started drinking heavily and became involved in drugs again. He had formerly been involved in drugs as a young man. Some of the drugs which Mr Pham's brother later found out Mr Pham had been using included crystal methylamphetamine, known as ice. 

19. The brothers are some five years apart. Mr Pham's brother said Mr Pham feels very bad about what he has done and very sorry that he had hurt members of his family and the people around him. He said his brother wants to be a better person. His brother has completed his Year 10 at TAFE many years ago and now wants to try for his HSC. Mr Pham's brother is prepared to re-employ him in his lawn mowing business when Mr Pham is released from custody. 

20. Cross-examined by Mr Vautin, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Pham's brother acknowledged that Mr Pham had never asked him for a loan or other assistance. 

21. The other source of information I have about Mr Pham is a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. The pre-sentence report has a helpful summary in the following terms: 
"" Mr Pham is a twenty-five year old man, who has apparently not been in trouble with the law for many years prior to the current offence. He admitted to heavy drug and alcohol abuse prior to being charged, and it appears he has a limited understanding of the impact of his offending on the victims and the community."" 

The report had detailed some of the information which Mr Pham's brother had provided me and noted specifically that Mr Pham had started drinking alcohol when he was fourteen years of age. Also from the same age he started using cannabis, heroin, crystalmeth, amphetamines and crack cocaine. He was keen to participate in gaol based drug and alcohol programs. The report noted that Mr Pham "" portrayed himself as being at a low level in drug supply hierarchy, and said he perceived his offence as not having any victims, Mr Pham advised that, he didn't believe there were any victims of his drug supply offence which would indicate that he has little remorse towards the commission of this offence."" 

22. Mr Pham, as I said, is now twenty-six. He has a criminal record but it comprises offences only committed when he was under eighteen. There are some drug offences and goods in custody offences which were dealt with by the Children's Court some ten years ago and a more recent traffic offence. I do not regard those previous convictions as being an aggravating factor so far as my sentencing of Mr Pham is concerned. 

23. Mr Pham was arrested, as I said, when the offence was detected on 6 July 2010 and the sentence should date from then. 

24.Mr Wilkinson also tendered material which indicated that in December 2002 Mr Pham had secured himself a certificate from the Institute of Automotive Mechanical Engineers in the automotive mechanical light vehicle division and financial information in the form of tax assessments which indicated his income over several years. 

25. Mr Wilkinson emphasised his client's ethic of hard work and the fact that his client was inhibited by his lack of education because of the family circumstances when he was growing up. He urged me not to find that the quantity of the drug is an overwhelming factor. He needed to make that submission because the amount of the drug which equals a large commercial quantity is one kilogram. Hence the amount of this drug - although it was substituted at the stage that Mr Pham was dealing with it - was some thirty times the large commercial quantity. 

26. Mr Wilkinson argued that the offence, so far as the standard non-parole period was concerned, should be regarded as being below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. He depicted his client as being an underling who was facilitating the process in accordance with instructions. He referred to the record of interview as the source for that proposition. He said that his client's role was devoid of sophistication. His job was to collect and transfer the drugs. His client was not engaged in any planning or organisation and did not know what the substance was. He was simply, Mr Wilkinson described, a cog in the wheel and at the bottom of the hierarchy. This can be illustrated by the fact that his role occurred in a McDonalds car park. 

27. Mr Wilkinson acknowledged that his client was driven by financial gain, including to settle debts for his drug problem. His involvement was relatively short. He acknowledged that the quantity of drugs plays a part in assessing where it lies in the range of objective seriousness, but that I must not lose sight of his client's role, which brings the offence below the middle of the range. He reminded me of what the High Court had said in The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 279 ([19]) that I must "" bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced "". There are, the High Court said, "" different levels of culpability "". 

28. Mr Wilkinson submitted his client was involved in and engaged in isolating offending in the context of drug use. Some remorse is expressed through his brother and the pre-sentence report. His client should benefit from the maximum twenty-five per cent discount for the plea of guilty. He urged me to consider that there are special circumstances for altering the ratio between the parole period and the additional term, including his client's age and the fact that it was his first time in custody and that he needed rehabilitation for his drug problem. 

29. Some of these submissions Mr Vautin agreed with. He accepted that the plea was at the earliest available opportunity and that Mr Pham is entitled to a discount of twenty-five per cent. He accepted that Mr Pham was a courier and had no higher engagement. 

30. However Mr Vautin pointed out that Mr Pham was involved in a very serious transaction involving a very large commercial quantity. The street value, Mr Vautin and Mr Wilkinson agreed, was in the region of seven a half million dollars if it was distributed in individual amounts. Mr Vautin pointed out that despite being at the bottom of the hierarchy the people above Mr Pham must have put a good deal of trust in him. 

31. Mr Vautin argued that the offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness and that I should bear in mind the standard non-parole period, although strictly not applicable because Mr Pham had pleaded guilty. It should still be referred to or borne in mind as a reference point. I must also not overlook that the offence is regarded as so serious that it carried life imprisonment. The offence in this case involved thirty times the large commercial quantity Mr Vautin emphasised. 

32. He agreed that there was no planning or organisation apart from that involved inherently in the nature of the offence. I also accept that Mr Pham's involvement was essentially on the day and in response to the telephone calls, although he had been available for this particular transaction for a week. 

33. I have determined, so far as the standard non-parole period is concerned, that the offence does fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. In my opinion no other finding is really open given that the amount involved was thirty times the large commercial quantity for this offence. However, I find that the offence falls at the lower end of the middle of the range, towards the bottom of the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That is because I accept the submissions about Mr Pham's role in the transaction which has been emphasised by Mr Wilkinson and acknowledged by Mr Vautin. 

34. I have had regard to the comparative cases made available to me by the parties. In particular, I have in mind how serious Parliament regards this offence; so serious that, I repeat, it has fixed a maximum of life imprisonment for this crime. 

35. Of the comparative sentences, I have had regard to two in particular, Elmir v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 22; (2009) 193 A Crim R 87 and Stevens v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 252. They are both decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal on appeal against the severity of sentences imposed for this kind of offence. In both cases the appeals were dismissed. In both cases the amounts involved were significantly less than the amount involved in Mr Pham's case. Both the primary judges, his Honour Judge Berman SC and her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace, were experienced sentencing judges. 

36. Taking all these matters into account, with particular reference to the maximum penalty available, the standard nonparole period as a guidepost and where this lies in the range of objective seriousness, I would regard an appropriate sentence as eighteen years imprisonment for this crime. 

37. However, Mr Pham has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I would therefore discount that sentence by twenty-five per cent. So that the sentence which I regard as appropriate is thirteen and a half years imprisonment. 

38. I accept Mr Wilkinson's submission that there are special circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio between a non-parole period and the balance of the term. A non-parole period for a sentence of thirteen and a half years imprisonment would normally be some ten years and one month. In this case I propose to reduce the non-parole period to nine and one-half years imprisonment. 

39. I am now going to sentence you, Mr Pham. I fix a non-parole period of nine and one half years imprisonment to commence on 6 July 2010 and to expire on 5 January 2020. There will be an additional term of four years imprisonment to commence on 6 January 2020 and to expire on 5 January 2024. The earliest date on which it appears to me you will be eligible for parole is 5 January 2020. 

40. Mr Pham for this serious crime I have sentenced you to thirteen and a half years gaol. That sentence commenced when you were arrested on 6 July 2010. I have fixed a non-parole period that you must stay in gaol for nine and one-half years. That expires on 5 January 2020. That date 5 January 2020 is the first date on which you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not is up to the Parole Authority who will assess you before that date. Once you are released on parole you will be still under sentence until the end of your overall sentence which expires on 5 January 2024. Do you understand? You are nodding, yes. Good luck Mr Pham. The video connection can now be switched off.

		05 August 2011",2011-07-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757371,R v Dwayne Anthony CARR (No 3) [2011] NSWSC 771,"Judgment 

1On 13 July 2011, the Court, as presently constituted, delivered judgment on an objection to the admissibility of an electronically recorded interview with the accused conducted by the police. During the course of that judgment, the Court summarised, in short form, the nature of the proceedings and the evidence before the Court: R v Dwayne Anthony CARR (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 724. For present purposes, I adopt, as a summary of the evidence, the reasons for judgment on that application. The Court ruled inadmissible the electronic record of interview. 

2On 13 July 2011, following the aforesaid ruling, and after the close of the Crown case, the accused applied for a directed verdict. On 14 July 2011, I refused an application to direct the verdict and reserved reasons. The Court did comment that the decision to refuse to direct a verdict was based upon the principle that a directed verdict was not available on the basis that there is a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. As earlier stated, I reserved reasons. These are the reasons. 

3The accused, Dwayne Carr, is charged with manslaughter and recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm. The Crown case has, due to agreement between the Crown and counsel for the accused, been run relatively efficiently, but there are significant issues with the case as presented. 

4Essentially, the charges relate to events at the premises of the deceased on the evening and night of 25 and 26 November 2009. The deceased and a number of other persons, including the accused, were consuming alcohol and marijuana. 

5The Crown case essentially rests upon the proposition that the accused pushed the deceased with much force, the deceased was forced backward hitting his shoulders and then his head against a wall. The motion of the head and the force with which it hit the wall was such that the push was described as forceful, the motion of the head as a whiplash, and the sound of the head hitting the wall as loud. 

6When the deceased's head hit the wall, he was described as dazed, looking like he was about to faint and leaning against the wall in order to stay up. Two seconds after hitting his head, he raised his hand to the back of his head. Other evidence suggests that he thereafter shook hands and farewelled some persons leaving the party. 

7Approximately 5 hours later, at 2.33am, a person in the premises, one of the ""partygoers"", called an ambulance, because the deceased was on the floor. At that time he was ""twitching"". 

8As earlier stated, there are significant problems with the Crown case. Apart from anything else, there is no evidence as to what had occurred during that 5-hour period. Further, no one, notwithstanding the presence of a number of people, actually saw the deceased fall. Thus, we have evidence that the accused pushed the deceased, he hit a wall and banged his head with much force. We have evidence that the deceased looked dazed, but we have no evidence that the deceased fell immediately or shortly thereafter. The next relevant evidence was that the deceased was seen on the kitchen floor over 5 hours' later. 

9The injuries to the deceased's head were significant. The injury to his crown, or the back of his head, was described by an expert pathologist as more likely to have occurred from a fall than from hitting his head against the wall, as described. There was an injury to the side of his head, which could not be explained by the fall backwards against a flat surface. Nor could it be explained by banging his head against the wall. There is no evidence of any other act of violence. 

10The medical expert does hold out the possibility that the injury to his right temporal area could have been caused by a fall backwards against a complex surface, or series of complex services or the striking of his head while falling backwards. The last-mentioned possibility lessened the likelihood that the fall backwards would have caused the first mentioned injury. 

11The Crown case depends upon the drawing of an inference that the fall in the kitchen occurred within a short time after the push against the wall and was, therefore, caused by the push against the wall and the banging of the head against the wall. 

12The accused submits that there is no evidence linking the push against the wall with the head injuries and therefore linking the act of the accused and the death of the deceased. 

13There is some conflict in the evidence, albeit in minor respects. There is little doubt that the push against the wall occurred at or about 9.00pm on the evening of 25 November 2009. Ms Mongta saw the accused push the deceased and left with her boyfriend immediately thereafter. She did not see the deceased fall. Ms Stewart, who had been involved in a domestic argument with the accused, with which the deceased was seeking to interfere, did not see the push against the wall, having run out of the unit at the time that the deceased sought to interfere in the disagreement between her and the accused. 

14Ms Stewart says that she heard Ms Mongta scream and went into the unit. She says Ms Mongta was in the unit at the time. However, Ms Mongta did not see that which is then described by Ms Stewart. Ms Stewart says she went into the unit after she saw Ms Mongta leaving in a timeframe that she describes as ""straightaway"". Ms Mongta does not see Ms Stewart. There are serious difficulties with the inconsistency in this evidence, given the size of the unit and the means of entry and exit. 

15The other difficulty with the evidence is that Ms Stewart openly admits that she was so drunk and so affected by marijuana that her appreciation of time is, effectively, meaningless. Minutes may have been hours; and hours may have been minutes. 

16The Crown case depends, necessarily, on the jury taking the view that Ms Stewart went into the unit as soon as she heard Ms Mongta scream, saw Ms Mongta leaving (even though Ms Mongta did not see her) and saw the deceased on the floor of the kitchen. Such evidence, if accepted, would necessarily involve a finding that the deceased fell immediately after the push against the wall and banging his head against the wall. If that evidence were accepted, and that inference drawn, then the jury could infer that the fall in the kitchen was caused by the push against the wall, the banging of the head and, necessarily, the conduct of the accused. In those circumstances, the jury could find the accused guilty. 

17It must be said that the application for a directed verdict has some significant merit. There are abundant reasons why those findings of fact would or could not be made. There are further reasons why the inferences on which the Crown case depends could or should not be made. Ms Stewart, as earlier stated, saw Ms Mongta in the unit, but Ms Mongta did not see Ms Stewart. This is almost a physical impossibility. The evidence is reconcilable only on the basis that Ms Stewart saw Ms Mongta leaving the unit from a position outside the unit. If that were so, given the unreliability of Ms Stewart as to timing, the inference that the Crown seeks the jury to draw would be, to say the least, problematic. 

18Moreover Ms Stewart attests that, on entering the unit, and seeing the deceased prostrate on the kitchen floor, steps were taken to call an ambulance. No account is taken of the 5-hour gap. Further, Mr Simms, another witness, attests to the fact that he did not see the deceased fall, because he was in the toilet. He came out of the bathroom, saw the deceased on the floor, and arranged for a call to the ambulance immediately. That would necessarily mean that the deceased fell some short time before 2.33am on the morning of 26 November 2009. 

19On the foregoing bases, counsel for the accused submits that there are reasonable hypotheses inconsistent with guilt available to the jury and those reasonable hypotheses are more likely to be the circumstances that in fact occurred. In other words, counsel for the accused maintains that it would be a serious error of law for the jury to conclude that the fall in the kitchen occurred immediately followed the banging of the head against the wall. 

20I accept that, on the evidence that has been adduced, there are reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence available to the jury. However, the principles upon which a directed verdict may be given are strict and confined. Once satisfied, those tests demand a directed verdict, and there is no residual discretion not to direct: Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212.6. 

21In determining whether there is no evidence that can sustain a guilty verdict, the Court is required to ignore contradictory evidence unfavourable to the Crown case and to take the Crown case at its highest, including any inferences that may arise from the evidence adduced. It is for the jury, not the judge, to resolve conflicting evidence: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74, per Gleeson CJ at 81. 

22One thing is clear from the principles that have been developed in relation to direct verdicts: it is not for the trial judge to determine the issue on the basis that a jury verdict would be unreasonable. Further, a judge is not entitled to direct a verdict because there is a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39. If an inference is available from the evidence adduced that is consistent with guilt, it is a matter for the jury, properly instructed, not for the trial judge, to draw that inference and to determine which evidence is accepted and which is rejected. 

23Ultimately, if the jury, notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence, determines that the accused is guilty, that is a matter that may be corrected on appeal. It is nevertheless for the jury to determine guilt or innocence, if there be evidence adduced that is consistent with guilt and upon which, assuming other evidence is not accepted, it would be open to find guilt. 

24In my view, while there is a hypothesis consistent with innocence and while a guilty verdict on the evidence of the Crown may be unreasonable, those are not matters upon which the Court, as presently constituted, may base a directed verdict. They are matters that, should the jury return a guilty verdict, may be the subject of argument in the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

25For the forgoing reasons, I determined that the application for directed verdict should be refused and ruled accordingly.

		22 July 2011",2011-07-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757372,R v Alexander TRAN [2011] NSWDC 105,"SENTENCE 

1. I am sentencing a thirty year old well-educated man, respected by his peers, who decided to make extra money by bringing into Australia a commercial quantity of a substance which he knew would be used to manufacture prohibited drugs in this country. That decision and action brought him from being a well-regarded citizen to becoming a criminal facing a maximum of twenty-five years gaol. 

2. The crime which he committed is a crime against federal legislation. It is a crime against s 307.11(1) of Criminal Code of the Commonwealth and is called importing a substance, intending to use, or believing that another person intended to use, any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being what is called a border controlled precursor. 

3. In this case, the border controlled precursor was pseudoephedrine. The quantity which Mr Tran imported into Australia was more than the commercial quantity. By that I mean it was a commercial quantity. It was over the minimum amount specified for a commercial quantity. 

4. It is important for a judge in sentencing an offender to set out briefly what happened which brought about the arrest and charging of the offender. 

5. In referring to Mr Tran as an offender, I now formally convict him of the crime which I referred to and I also note that he has pleaded guilty to the crime. 

6. Briefly, what happened is this. On 9 September 2009 Customs examined some mail which arrived from Vietnam. It was registered and bore a number. It was addressed to a man in Chester Hill. The sender of the package was referred to as another man from Vietnam. The package described itself as containing fruit powder, dried fruit and knurr flavour. 

7. Customs officers opened them and found nine packets. Each one weighed about a kilogram. They were variously labelled. They tested a powder sampled from each packet and this returned a positive result for the presence of pseudoephedrine. 

8. Then what Customs did was to arrange for the nine packets to be weighed and analysed - the total weight was just under nine kilograms - and testing and analysis confirmed that the powder in each packet contained pseudoephedrine. It was determined that the total pure quantity of pseudoephedrine was some 1.818 kilograms. 

9. A week later, on 16 September 2009, Mr Tran arrived at Sydney International Airport. He arrived from Vietnam. He had left Australia to go there on 12 August 2009. There was a routine examination of his baggage. Customs found the sender's receipt for a mail article which corresponded with the number on the registered mail package which had been detected a week before with the pseudoephedrine. They also found in Mr Tran's luggage what is described as ""a quantity of laboratory type glassware"". 

10. Mr Tran was interviewed and told those interviewing him that he lived at Villawood and that he had visited Vietnam to visit his grandmother who was ill and other members of his family. He accepted that the document was a receipt but said he had not seen it before, he was not familiar with the sender, and thought that the friend who was packing his suitcase might have put it in there. He said he had met a man in a club in Vietnam who had assisted him in packing his bag. He made no comment about the laboratory type glassware. 

11. There was a man waiting for Mr Tran called Steven Lee. Customs did a search which revealed that Steven Lee had sent some $3,000 to Mr Tran in Vietnam by Western Union Transfer. That had occurred on 29 August 2009. Mr Lee had transferred $8,000 to another person in Vietnam. 

12. What Customs did on the day that Mr Tran arrived was to substitute "" an inert substance for the pseudoephedrine powder found in the nine packets "" a week earlier on 9 September. Later that day, Customs officers delivered the parcel to the Chester Hill address. It was accepted by a man named James Tran who was not known to have any familial connection with Mr Tran whom I am sentencing. 

13. Then a search warrant was executed at the Chester Hill house. Mr Tran had opened the packages and he told the Customs officers that he had realised that the package had been delivered in error, and he was going to take it back to the Post Office. 

14. The Customs officers then turned their attention to where Mr Tran whom I am sentencing lived in Villawood. Mr Tran himself was not home. People were there who said that they were his parents and they also found a man, Maxwell Tran said to be his brother. 

15. It is important here to record what the facts say. They say that, amongst other items, "" customs officers located and seized from the property "" various items, including the laboratory glass equipment which Mr Tran had brought in earlier that day, about 1.4 kilograms of a white powder, electronic scales, a safe, and two computer hard drives. The safe was said to be "" in one of the bedrooms "". There is a further description of the glass laboratory equipment. It apparently included "" condensers, flasks, pipettes, and separator funnels "". The facts describe that equipment as "" consistent with the type of equipment found in clandestine laboratories involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine ."" The equipment was also said to be "" consistent with equipment described in the methylamphetamine manufacturing instructions located on one of the hard drives seized from the same property "". 

16. The reason that it is illegal to import pseudoephedrine into Australia without a licence is that, as the facts record, it is used in the manufacture of a border controlled drug, including methylamphetamine. The white powder was found to be a substance which is a known diluent - known as a cutting agent -and frequently found mixed with methylamphetamine. 

17. The safe in the bedroom was later found to contain "" a number of bowls, cups, ashtrays, spoons, lighters, straws or small tubes, a toothbrush and a NSW driver's licence in the name of the offender "". The forensic department of the Police analysed the computer hard drives and found a thirteen page document "" containing detailed instructions on how to manufacture methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine "". 

18. Mr Tran was arrested some months later, on 11 February 2010. It is noted that he had no licence or permit to import pseudoephedrine. 

19. Mr Tran has a criminal history, but the offences occurred quite some time ago. He was convicted of offences involving stolen cars in 1999 and since then has only two traffic convictions. Such a record I do not regard as an aggravating feature so far as this offence is concerned, nor do I regard it as a counteracting, given the age and the nature of the offences, the impact of the character references which he has tendered in evidence. 

20. The amount of the pseudoephedrine is about one and a half times the commercial quantity. 

21. There is a helpful pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service about Mr Tran. Its summary says the following- 
"" Mr Tran is a thirty year old Australian from a Vietnamese cultural background. He resides in the Villawood area with his parents and his brother, and appears to enjoy a close and supportive relationship with them. He excelled at school and then at university, where he obtained his Bachelor of Information and Technology. The offender has been employed in the information technology field since completing university. He provided this service with personal references from a varying range of friends, who all praised his dedication to work and commitment to family. Mr Tran informed this service that his offence was wholly motivated by greed. He appeared sorry for his actions, especially in regard to the worry his offences caused to his parents ."" 

The report had earlier noted that Mr Tran "" readily informed this service that his offence was wholly motivated by greed, and his desire to obtain money easily. He admitted that, at the time of his offence, he suspected he was engaging in criminal activity but chose to overlook his suspicions ."" He expressed to the Service "" feelings of foolishness and shame, and sorrow for the suffering he had inflicted on his parents ."" The Service was concerned that his focus on financial gain could mean that his actions could be repeated. 

22. Mr Tran had a relatively stable upbringing with his parents who were refugees from Vietnam. When Mr Tran was arrested on 11 February 2010 he was bailed later that day and has had no time in custody. 

23. I mentioned that the pre-sentence report referred to references. Mr M Coroneos of counsel tendered, on behalf of his client, exhibit 1 which comprised a series of references and certificates and educational qualifications. The references are very impressive. Mr Tran is highly regarded by his peers as a sincere, honest and responsible young man who has gone out of his way to assist a number of those who have provided references with their education and progress in life. The referees make it clear that this offence is totally out of character for Mr Tran. All of the references refer to the offence but none of them appears to refer to the laboratory equipment which Mr Tran also brought into the country. The references, I say, are very impressive and in due course I will take them into account. 

24. Mr Coroneos also tendered a comprehensive psychological report from Mr W John Taylor, a forensic psychologist. 

25. I should add before I refer to Mr Taylor's report that a number of the referees expressed how ashamed and remorseful Mr Tran was about his offending behaviour. 

26. Returning to Mr Taylor's report, he explained to Mr Taylor that he had met a person in a bar in Vietnam and the man "" asked me if I could assist him in posting a package for him and he offered me about $2,000. I thought it would be useful because I was on holidays so I did it ."" He acknowledged that it was the worst thing that he had done in his life and added that he was "" regretful because of my family "". He also acknowledged that what he had done "" will have affected other people "". It explained, Mr Taylor noted that "" Mr Tran said that he was aware of the harm that drugs caused to people and that, in committing the offence, he was contributing to drug use ."" He is reasonably healthy psychologically, apart from the obvious stress brought about by this offending behaviour and his predicament. 

27. Mr Taylor noted that Mr Tran accepted responsibility for his behaviour and did not attempt to deflect any blame from himself. Mr Taylor expressed the opinion that Mr Tran "" has a low risk of recidivism "". He also thought that Mr Tran "" has good prospects of rehabilitation "". That would be assisted by having his family support. I have taken into account that report of Mr Taylor. 

28. Both Mr A Powell from the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and Mr Coroneos provided very helpful written submissions and addressed me in Court as well. 

29. Mr Powell's basic position was that Mr Tran's conduct "" constituted a serious breach "" of the particular law. But Mr Powell submitted that Mr Tran had travelled to Vietnam for the purpose of arranging the import and that Mr Tran had "" played a significant role in the importation "". Even if he had not played a significant role, Mr Powell reminded me of what the higher courts have said that "" illicit drug organisations are only able to prosper when people are ready, willing and able, to undertake these types of roles "". 

30. I am satisfied that Mr Tran was aware of what was being brought into the country. He had the receipt with him and as part of his plea of guilty he must be acknowledging that he intended to use himself, or believed that another person intended to use, what he brought into the country to manufacture an illegal drug. 

31. Mr Powell emphasised that the offence was committed for financial reward. 

32. The plea of guilty may be taken into account as a mitigating factor because it "" demonstrates a willingness to facilitate the course of justice "". The saving of the community of the expense of a contested trial is not relevant. So far as demonstrating a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, Mr Powell pointed out that the plea was entered at what he described as "" a very late stage "". It was only some days before the commencement of the trial that he pleaded guilty. 

33. Mr Powell acknowledged in submissions in Court that Mr Tran should be given some discount. He argued that a full-time period of imprisonment was the only way that the matter could be dealt with. Prior good character, he reminded me, "" is generally of less weight as a mitigating factor "" in these kinds of offences. He submitted that I could be satisfied under 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth that fulltime imprisonment was the only appropriate sentencing option. 

34. Mr Coroneos argued that his client "" did not play a significant role in the importation "" of the precursor. He also argued that there is "" insufficient evidence for an affirmative finding to be made that the offender intended to play a significant role in its manufacture into methylamphetamines "". He argued that there is "" available evidence that the offender travelled overseas primarily for the purpose of visiting relatives ."" He argued that his client "" had performed only a limited role "". 

35. Mr Coroneos said that there was insufficient evidence that his client was aware of the precise quantity of the precursor which was to be imported. Although I have previously referred to that, and indicated that I am satisfied, I am reminded by that submission that I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt and, because the postage document was not part of the exhibits, I cannot be so satisfied. 

36. Before returning to Mr Coroneos's submissions, I need to make a finding about his client's role. I was at first minded to find that he had travelled to Vietnam for the purposes of obtaining the drug, and was clearly involved in the enterprise in a capacity greater than a courier. Those findings were connected with the other items which were found in the house where he lived. However, Mr Coroneos reminded me of the law regarding possession and, so far as drugs are concerned, concerning exclusive possession. I think he has a point there. The house was, on the evidence, occupied by three other people, comprising Mr Tran's brother and parents. The facts do not specify exactly where some of the items were found, except we know that Mr Tran brought the laboratory equipment into the country with him and that one of the items was found outside a bathroom. 

37. To my mind, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tran knew about the presence of these items. There must be, in my opinion, a reasonable possibility that somebody else in the household may have been engaged more actively than Mr Tran and that Mr Tran may have been recruited to undertake the import whilst he was in Vietnam. I make that finding only because I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the finding urged upon me by the prosecution. 

38. Returning to Mr Coroneos's submissions, he pointed out that a range of discount of ten to twenty-five per cent was reasonable and that his client had accepted responsibility for his offending. He argued that the "" good character of the offender and the offender's criminal antecedents should be considered to operate to mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentence "". I accept that submission but I also agree that good character has a limited effect so far as these kinds of offences are concerned. 

39. Mr Coroneos invited me to make a finding that his client had voluntarily ceased the criminal activity because he had brought the substance into the country some months before he was arrested. I do not find that that is the kind of behaviour which constitutes voluntary cessation of criminal activity for the purposes of having a mitigating impact on a sentence. His client had been detected bringing material into the country and his house had been searched. It is hardly surprising that he did not engage in any further activity. 

40. Mr Coroneos reminded me that his client has been subject to very strict bail conditions and that I should find that his client is unlikely to re-offend and has positive rehabilitation prospects. 

41. Although the Probation and Parole Service report expressed some reservations, I am inclined to find that he is unlikely to re-offend and that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. This is where the character references provide me with some guidance. He is a well-educated young man and has demonstrated an altruistic attitude to life and to assisting his friends in the past. His friends have indicated the impact which the detection of this crime has had on him, and I am inclined to agree that his prospects are reasonably good. 

42. Mr Coroneos reminded me that I may take into account his client's expressed remorse and contrition. He said that I could consider some alternatives to a full-time custodial sentence, such as suspending the sentence. 

43. Mr Powell, in his submissions before me, reminded me that assertions by Mr Tran to the various people he had seen could not be accorded the same weight as they might be by sworn evidence. I accept that submission. In particular, I accept the submission that the assertions made to the Probation and Parole Service that he suspected the illegal activity somewhat reduce the reliability that I can place on what Mr Tran has told others. That is simply not consistent with his plea of guilty and in accordance with his acknowledgement which the plea comprises, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he brought this precursor into Australia either intending to use it himself or at least believing that someone else intended to use it in order to manufacture an illegal drug. His description given to the Probation and Parole Officer of suspecting something illegal and wanting to make a little bit of money on the side is disingenuous and I do not accept it. However, I do not find, as Mr Powell invited me, that he left Australia to obtain the substance. 

44. Mr Coroneos reminded me of the range that I can make allowances for, so far as discount is concerned, and in due course I will make further reference to that. 

45. I take into account the seriousness of this offence as indicated by the fact that Parliament has attached a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment to it. 

46. I accept Mr Coroneos's submission that his client's criminal antecedents are not significant. 

47. I have formed the opinion that no other sentence than a full-time custodial sentence is appropriate in a case such as this. Mr Tran brought into the country one and a half times the commercial quantity of the precursor knowing that it would be used either by him or others in the manufacture of illegal drugs. 

48. I would regard an appropriate overall sentence as seven years imprisonment. However, because of his remorse and his preparedness to facilitate the course of justice, I will discount that sentence by ten per cent to fix a sentence of six years and three months. I regard an appropriate non-parole period for that sentence as four years. 

HIS HONOUR: I am going to stop there. Mr Tran, your overall sentence is six years and three months and you must spend four of those years in gaol. I will explain that further to you in a moment and you will go into custody today. 
But first I need your assistance Mr Powell and Mr Samaan - Mr Powell, particularly - just how I specify this sentence and whether a non-parole period is the appropriate expression to use. I have got an extract of the Crimes Act in front of me. 

POWELL: Yes, your Honour, it does differ from the expression in relation to a State offence so if your Honour-- 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, which section do I look at? 
POWELL: Your Honour, 19A(b) of the Crimes Act, which is referred to at para 41 of the Crown's submissions. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I have got in front of me, 19A(b). 

POWELL: Gives your Honour the option to either fix a non-parole period or make a recognisance release order in relation to the head sentence. Your Honour had indicated an intention to fix a non-parole period so-- 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, but I will hear you on that unless - I will hear both of you on that if you want to be. What is your position? 

POWELL: The Crown's position, as expressed in the submissions that were before your Honour is that it would be-- 

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, remind me of that paragraph? 

POWELL: Paragraph 41, the last sentence in that paragraph states, ""In this instance the sentence of imprisonment of a fixed non-parole period would be appropriate"". 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I see what you mean. 

POWELL: And, unless your Honour wishes to hear my friend first in relation to any submission about a recognisance release order, my submission is that the appropriate form of the sentence would be for your Honour just to express that you impose a sentence of imprisonment of six years and three months commencing from today. 

HIS HONOUR: And fix a non-parole period of four years commencing from today. 

SAMAAN: There is no objection to that course. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay thank you both. I have already Mr Tran. 


49. I impose a sentence on Mr Tran of six years and three months imprisonment to date from today and to expire on 13 October 2017. I fix a non-parole period in respect of that sentence of four years, to commence today, 14 July 2011, and to expire on 13 July 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: Now, Mr Powell and Mr Samaan, are those figures right? 
POWELL: Your Honour, in relation to the non-parole period, I believe your Honour indicated it would expire 13 July 2013. Giving it to the four year period, I would make it that it expire on 13 July 2015. 

HIS HONOUR: That's right, I'm not sure where I got that. I'm sorry about that, I'll explain that. 

POWELL: Thank you. 
HIS HONOUR: But otherwise, it's right? 
POWELL: Thank you, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Mr Samaan? 
SAMAAN: Thank you, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Mr Powell and Mr Samaan, do I need to make any orders, or is that it? I think that's it. 

POWELL: There's no further orders. 
HIS HONOUR: No, that's what I thought. 

50. Mr Tran, you have heard me give my reasons. You got yourself into some very serious criminal activity importing this substance, this pseudoephedrine, into Australia, a commercial amount, one and a half times the commercial amount of it. By definition you knew what you were bringing into the country and what it was going to be used for. That is a very serious crime. I have sentenced you to six years and three months for that crime. The sentence starts today and the overall sentence expires on 13 October 2017. I have fixed a non-parole period of four years, that is a little less than it might otherwise be. That will commence today when you go into custody, and it will expire on 13 July 2015. You will be eligible to be released on 13 July 2015. Do you understand that? All right, anything else. 

POWELL: Thank you, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Is this your family at the back there? 
OFFENDER: Yes. 
HIS HONOUR: You may have a short time with them. 
Mr Samaan, the prison authorities say that, for the purposes of classification of an offender, it is very helpful if they have any psychological material which has gone into evidence in the sentence proceedings. I have in mind to either send with the Corrective Services officers now, or my associate can send it by fax or email this afternoon, the report of Mr Taylor. What do you have to say to that? 

SAMAAN: I think it's a good idea for that to be sent. Either way. 

HIS HONOUR: So do I. All right, I will just ask the Corrective Services officers who have come to Court. Would you rather it is faxed or do you-- 

CORRECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER: If it's easier for you, we can take it with us and it can go with him today. 

HIS HONOUR: All right, why don't I give it to you, and I will provide that now and the Court officer will hand it to you, and it's the persons who classify Mr Tran who find that material helpful. 

Now, Mr Samaan, a lot of these very helpful references are originals, if not all of them. My guess is that you might want those back. 

SAMAAN: Did Mr Coroneos hand you a copy of-- 

HIS HONOUR: No, but what do you want to do? They can stay with the Court file and you can get them at some future stage, or I can give them back now, whichever you prefer. 

SAMAAN: If we can get them back now. 

HIS HONOUR: All right, I am going to leave the exhibit marking on them. 

SAMAAN: That's fine. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't know what is going to happen next. It might be prudent for you to hang on to those in that form. 

SAMAAN: Thank you. 

HIS HONOUR: The other exhibits, I will return to my associate with the indictment. 

POWELL: Your Honour, I can indicate I have a photocopy provided to me by Mr Coroneos of those documents. I assume it's a complete set. Perhaps if your Honour's associate checks those documents-- 

HIS HONOUR: I was going to ask you to check. 

POWELL: I can do that. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, why don't you two check and I will be back at 2.30 and, if they are the same, then I would be grateful. Thank you, Mr Powell. I will resume at 2.30. Mr Tran, you are now in the hands of the Corrective Services, not of me, but I will indicate that, if he wants to have a word with his family, just for a minute or two, then that's okay by me, but he is in your custody, not mine. It's not for me to tell you what to do. I will now adjourn.

		25 August 2011",2011-07-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757378,Santo v R [2011] NSWCCA 156,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL :  The applicant was convicted following a jury trial of one count of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of robbery whilst armed with wounding contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act . The maximum penalty for each offence is 25 years imprisonment. Each offence has a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  2At the time that the applicant was being sentenced she was already serving a sentence for an offence of robbery in company which she committed on 30 March 2007 and for which she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 10 months. For that offence she was eligible to be released on parole on 26 April 2011.  3The applicant was charged in relation to the present matters on 19 May 2008 and was in custody solely in relation to these matters from 20 May 2008 until 27 June 2008. The sentencing judge backdated the sentence to accommodate this period of custody.  4At the time the applicant committed the offences, that are the subject of this appeal on 14 May 2008, she was on conditional bail for the robbery in company offence.  5For each of the offences for which the applicant was found guilty by the jury she was sentenced to a period of 13 years imprisonment. A non-parole period of 9 years and 9 months commencing on 19 March 2011 and expiring on 18 December 2020 was imposed, with an additional term of 3 years and 3 months commencing on 19 December 2020 and expiring on 18 March 2024. The sentences were made concurrent.  6The applicant seeks leave to raise six grounds of appeal as follows:  1. Both the individual head sentences and the non-parole periods are excessive.  2. His Honour erred in finding that the sentences were above mid-range in terms of seriousness.  3. His Honour erred in making findings of fact which were not based on any evidence in the trial.  4. His Honour erred in not properly applying the principle of totality in totally aggregating the sentences on an earlier sentence.  5. His Honour erred in not finding special circumstances.  6. The aggregate head sentence and non-parole period are excessive.  7The sentencing judge made findings with respect to the relevant facts.  8As at 14 May 2008, Mr Rymaszewski lived at Ashfield and was 84 years. The applicant was aged 34 years. Mr Rymaszewski had travelled to the city that day to have lunch with his son for his son's birthday. After lunch, Mr Rymaszewski went to Central Railway Station. Instead of immediately catching a train home, he went to a bar on the concourse of the railway station to have another drink. The applicant was also in the general bar area. The applicant and Mr Rymaszewski who were previously unknown to each other became engaged in conversation and over a couple of hours, Mr Rymaszewski bought a few rounds of drinks for the applicant and himself. The applicant and Mr Rymaszewski then left the bar and travelled by train to Ashfield. Although they had been drinking, neither of them was intoxicated, nor adversely affected by alcohol. They then proceeded to Mr. Rymaszewski's flat. Mr Rymaszewski prepared a light meal for the applicant and himself.  9In relation to what happened next, there was a contest at trial. However, the sentencing judge said that the applicant's evidence at trial was ""deliberately and calculatedly dishonest"" and ""on any contested issue of fact, I would not accept anything the offender said unless it was independently corroborated.""  10The applicant asked to be shown around the flat. They came to a bedroom where Mr Rymaszewski showed his computer to the applicant. Whilst he was doing so the applicant quickly undressed. She offered to massage the victim. He initially expressed surprise and reluctance but after reassurances from the applicant he undressed and lay on his bed on his stomach. The applicant sat across his low back. While she was massaging his back, Mr Rymaszewski heard the sound of glass breaking. It was a bottle of vodka which the applicant had brought to his bedroom and which she smashed by hitting it with considerable force on the wall.  11Mr Rymaszewski felt a sharp stabbing pain to the left side of his neck. He tried to turn around but could not. The applicant had her knees against his back. Mr Rymaszewski statrted to yell for help and for the police. He could feel more sharp stabbing pains to his neck and upper back. He tried to bang on the wall next to the bed with his fist. The applicant was saying: ""I am going for your jugular; I am going for your jugular"".  12Mr Rymaszewski tried to wriggle out from underneath the applicant but she had him pinned down. Mr Rymaszewski thought he was going to die. At one point he tried to twist his head to look over his shoulder at which point the applicant grabbed one of his pillows and put it over his mouth. He felt her hand pressing against his face, covering his nose and mouth. As she pressed the pillow against his face, Mr Rymaszewski could feel the sharp stabbing pain continuing in his back.  13Suddenly everything stopped. Mr Rymaszewski was exhausted. The applicant left the premises with his mobile phone and $250 in cash. Mr Rymaszewski dialled triple O and was ultimately taken to hospital.  14There was an issue at the trial as to whether Mr Rymaszewski knew the applicant was a prostitute and whether they had returned to his flat with an expectation that they would have sex. In relation to this issue the sentencing judge said:  ""Whether or not the offender actually intended to provide sexual service to Mr Rymaszewski is not clear but what is clear beyond reasonable doubt is that at least from the time she left the bar with him, she intended to rob him. In this regard, Mr Rymaszewski, despite his actual age, was a very fit looking gentleman at the time. Any plan to rob him necessarily involved the very real prospect of the use of violence by the offender to achieve her aim.  Whether it was always her intent to inflict the degree of violence that she ultimately came to inflict is not clear but the attack was not impulsive. Getting Mr Rymaszewski to undress and lie down on his stomach on a bed while the offender sat across his low back pretending to give him a massage was a planned act to render him vulnerable to her subsequent violence.  I am unable to conclude with any certainty when this scheme came into her mind but I have no doubt that immediately before or shortly after she entered the premises, she had decided on the course she ultimately pursued. [ROS 6]""  15The victim suffered three significant stab wounds to the neck, two of which were quite deep. One wound to the neck penetrated the muscle. Another wound to the neck left a 4 x 2 cm skin loss which was unable to be sutured. He also suffered a particularly deep wound at the rear of the neck in the area of clavicle which penetrated into the supraclavicular fossa. He also suffered two deep wounds near the right shoulder blade and near the right rear underarm, one of which went down to the muscle and towards the bone. He had another wound to his back which was a full thickness wound requiring stitching. The victim also suffered numerous superficial lacerations including to head, face, ear, arms and back. He also suffered bruising particular to his face. He suffered a traction injury to his left arm which has led to ongoing problems with his use of the arm. He remained at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from his admission on 14 May 2008 to 27 May 2008 after which he was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.  Grounds 1, 2 and 6  16Both offences carried a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The sentencing judge determined that the objective seriousness of each of the offences was substantially above the middle of the range and accordingly the non-parole period in each case exceeded the standard non-parole period of 7 years. In determining that the offences were substantially above the mid range the sentencing judge had regard to the fact that there was some planning involved and the offences occurred in the victim's home. The victim was 84 years of age and suffered serious wounds inflicting both physical and significant psychological injury upon him. The applicant effectively tricked the victim into lying naked in a vulnerable position where she could confine him and took a broken bottle to inflict injuries upon him.  17Although the applicant complained that it was not open for his Honour to determine that the offences were substantially above the mid-range I am satisfied that this finding and the sentence which his Honour imposed as a consequence were appropriate. This Court has indicated on many occasions that where an offence falls upon the scale of objective seriousness is a matter falling within the sentencing judge's discretion. This Court is reluctant to interfere with the finding made by the sentencing judge. R v Dang (2005) NSWCCA 430; R v Mulato (2006) NSWCCA 282; Perry v R (2006) NSWCCA 351; Stanford v R (2007) NSWCCA 73; R v Fisher (2008) NSWCCA 103.  18In relation to the sentences and non-parole periods which his Honour imposed it is important to remember that the applicant has a criminal record and committed these offences when she was on parole. In a callous and deliberate manner she sought to take advantage of an 84 year old man and inflict physical injury on him facilitating the robbery and escape from the premises.  19The maximum penalty provided for these offences is a term of imprisonment of 25 years. Even if severe the sentences imposed do not require the intervention of this Court (see Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171).  Ground 3  20The complaint under this ground of appeal relates to the finding by his Honour that the applicant formed an intention to rob the victim before she left the hotel.  21Whether or not the applicant had formed the relevant intention when she left the bar or whether it was formed at some later point is to my mind immaterial. It is plain that it was open to his Honour to find that the applicant formed an intention to inflict injury on her victim and rob him and did not act impulsively. She thought of a plan to have him undress and lie on his stomach making him vulnerable to her restraint and available for her to inflict serious wounds.  22The sentencing judge made two findings of present relevance. One finding was that when she left the bar with her victim the applicant intended to rob him. The other finding was that his Honour could not conclude ""with any certainty"" when the scheme which she ultimately carried out came into her mind, although he believed it to be shortly before or after she entered his premises.  23These findings are not inconsistent. His Honour was merely indicating that he was satisfied that she had formed an intention to rob him when she left the bar although the precise manner in which the robbery would be carried out and the intention to attack him with a broken bottle may have been formed at a later point in time.  Ground 4  24Under this ground complaint is made that the sentencing judge failed to pay appropriate regard to issues of totality having regard to the sentence which the applicant was then serving for the earlier offence. It is well established that questions of accumulation and concurrency are matters falling within the discretion of the sentencing judge. R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. There is no general rule which determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [47].  25In the present case it is clear from his Honour's remarks that he was conscious of the issues of totality and accordingly determined to commence the new sentences upon the expiration of the non-parole period of the sentence which had previously been imposed. That sentence included a finding of special circumstances which reduced the non-parole period from that which would otherwise have been required. Mindful of these matters the sentencing judge was careful to indicate that he had had regard to issues of totality and proportionality but had determined that the sentences he imposed were appropriate.  26In these circumstances there is no error in the path which his Honour took. I reject this ground of appeal.  Ground 5  27Under this ground of appeal the applicant complained that his Honour should have made a finding of special circumstances. Special circumstances are a matter falling within the discretion of the sentencing judge. In considering the matter his Honour recognised the fact that the sentence which he proposed to impose would provide a period on parole in excess of 3 years. Mindful of his finding, which was clearly open, that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were dubious, there was no requirement for a longer period of parole.  28There is no error in the course which the sentencing judge took in relation to this issue.  Orders:  1. Grant leave to appeal.  2. Appeal dismissed.  29HIDDEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  30GROVE AJ: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  **********

		22 July 2011",2011-07-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757382,R v Ahmed ARJA [2011] NSWDC 131,"SENTENCE 

1The offender, Ahmed Arja, stands for sentence today having pleaded guilty to an offence pursuant to s 193B(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence indicates that on 28 February 2007 at Hexham and elsewhere he did, together with another person who I will not name because his trial is due to commence in this complex shortly, dealt with the proceeds of crime in the sum of $814,000, being reckless as to whether it was the proceeds of crime. 

2There are Agreed Facts and I will summarise them very briefly. 

3Operation Schoale was a major New South Wales Crime Commission and New South Wales Police Force operation in relation to the importation and supply of cocaine. Two persons in particular were senior principals in this operation. Both have been charged. One was recently sentenced by me to a lengthy term of imprisonment. The other comes to trial in this complex, as I have said, shortly. Other members of the syndicate or those involved with the two principals have been charged with various offences, including those of dealing with the proceeds of crime. 

4It would appear that the man whose trial is to come up shortly was a long-term school friend of the present offender. He had, for a period of time, chosen to live under the radar so far as authorities were concerned. Given what I understand to be the possible criminal charges against him, that is perhaps understandable from his point of view. He sought to utilise his friendship with the offender to assist him in moving a large quantity of cash from Queensland to New South Wales. He did not himself have a credit card. It would appear that he rang the offender and put to him a proposition about going to Queensland. The offender agreed and provided his credit card details to this other man. A flight was booked. They drove to an expensive hotel on the Gold Coast. It would appear that this night out with his friend was the reward the offender received. 

5While they were at those premises police, who had the principal under surveillance and had been lawfully intercepting his telephone calls, noted that two men came to the hotel, one of whom arrived with two bags and left without them. Arrangements were made on the following day by this offender to hire a car. He did so in his own name. That car was driven from Queensland to New South Wales. Police stopped the vehicle on the Hexham Bridge just outside of Newcastle. The offender and his principal were arrested. The vehicle was searched. A bag was found and in that bag was found a total of $814,000 in cash. He was then arrested and bailed. 

6The Crown accepts that the role of this offender was limited to assisting his principal with the transport of cash from Queensland into New South Wales. They also accept that, so far as his criminality is concerned, it falls below that of others who have been sentenced following Operation Schoale. They include Ms Saliba and Mr Peisley. 

7In her written submissions to the Court Ms Gray, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, summarises the role of the offender in terms which are accepted by the defence and accord with the Agreed Facts: 

""The offender's role was that of a person assisting with the transportation of money. The money was not his. The offender was assisting the principal in moving the funds interstate by renting a car in his name and paying for it. The principal did not have any bank accounts or credit cards in his name at the relevant time"". 

8The offender's conduct had the potential to enable the principal to avoid detection for his role in the offence. The telephone calls indicate that this offender was participating in the enterprise, albeit it with some reluctance. The co-offender states in the call that they will need to get a car and that he required this offender's credit card. It was therefore already planned that they would be returning the next day by another means of transport than flying. 

9Whilst the offence is a serious offence, the conduct of this offender was over a limited period of time (two days) and of a limited nature, being confined to the arrangements for the transportation of money. 

10The present offender has some criminal antecedents. Because of them he is not entitled to leniency that would otherwise be extended to a first offender but they do not in any way aggravate the sentence that I impose. 

11During the course of his bail he committed one offence, possession of a drug, for which he was fined $225. That matter does not aggravate the offence but it is of concern when I come to consider the disposition of this matter. 

12There is before me in Exhibit 1 evidence that the offender suffered serious back injuries following a motor vehicle accident. I am sufficiently familiar with the nature of those injuries to appreciate that he would have been, and remains, in considerable pain. The use of illicit drugs to alleviate such pain, while not in any way condoned, is perhaps understandable. Otherwise, it would appear that he used his time on bail to lead a law-abiding life. He has a wife and three children. He has not been able to work and has accumulated debts but I am informed that he now has the capacity to resume work. 

13When I consider matters such as this I have to take into account that the offence to which he pleaded guilty involves dealing with a large amount of currency. The rationale for offences such as this is aimed at stopping not only those involved in the commission of serious offences but also of associates who assist in dealing with such funds. Anyone willing to assist in the dealing of such funds are, in effect, acting as accessories to the very serious crimes committed. Here, I know that the money involved in these offences came from serious drug supply and importation matters. The impact of such crimes on the community can be immense. They are of real concern as they cause substantial harm, both economic and otherwise. 

14While this offence falls towards the bottom of the range of the type of matters covered by the part of the Crimes Act 1900 concerned with dealing with proceeds of crime, it still remains a serious offence. That seriousness is reflected in the ten year maximum penalty provided. 

15While ""recklessness"" is generally regarded as a less serious aspect of the crime than those committed by people who know the source of the funds dealt with, it is still a matter that would, given the amount of funds involved, result in a custodial penalty. Because of the offender's record, it is still in my opinion, having considered all possible alternatives, a matter that does call for a custodial penalty. 

16The plea came late but I am informed from the bar table, and accept, that it still had considerable utilitarian value as the Crown had problems with witnesses. I am also aware that because of the resources required to investigate and pursue the prosecutions that arose out of Operation Schoale, those who fell to the periphery of the operation were not given, understandably, the priority accorded the principals. In those circumstances, more than a ten per cent reduction in penalty is required. When I do some rough calculations it would be less than fifteen per cent but significantly more than ten. 

17In the circumstances, I can recognise the seriousness of the crime by imposing a custodial penalty but when I step back and look at the antecedents of the offender, his prospects for rehabilitation and the need to encourage that rehabilitation in the community, this is a sentence that can be suspended. 

18Were it not for your plea of guilty a sentence of eighteen months would have been imposed upon you. 

19You are convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifteen months. Pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I order that the execution of the sentence be suspended upon you entering into a good behaviour bond for a period of fifteen months, commencing today, 15 July 2011 with the following conditions: 

(a) to appear before the Court to be sentenced if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond; 
(b) to be of good behaviour; and 
(c) to advise the Registrar of the District Court of any change of address. 

20That can be entered in the Registry on Level 3 as soon as it is taken out. 

21In relation to the two goods suspected of being stolen matters on the s 166 certificate, on the application of the Director, those matters are withdrawn and dismissed.

		21 September 2011",2011-07-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757383,R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL :  The respondent was tried for the murder of her baby named Tegan. On 10 November 2010 the trial judge Whealy J determined that the Crown could not rely upon statements made by the respondent, in which she explained that she had given the child to others as evidence of her guilt. It is the Crown case that the respondent lied when she said she had given the child to other people out of a consciousness of her guilt because if she had told the truth she would have admitted the alleged offence.  2The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed the ruling made by Whealy J pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act . Section 5F(2) provides that the Crown may appeal against any interlocutory judgment or order made by the trial judge. The section was amended to s 5F(3A) which expands the Crown's right of appeal and provides that the Director may appeal to this Court ""against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case.""  3As I make plain below the ruling made by Whealy J was as to the purpose for which the disputed evidence was relevant. In R v Jennings [2010] NSWCCA 193 this Court determined that a decision as to the permitted use of admissible evidence was a decision contemplated by s 5F(3A). Latham J referred to the decision of this Court in R v Harker (2004) NSWCCA 427 where Howie J (Santow JA and Bell J agreeing) said:  ""In any event it seems that the legislature had in mind that the Crown could appeal against a determination in respect of the admissibility of evidence that was not a ruling on admissibility. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine the scope of the matters that might fall within the scope of s 5F(3A) but it seems clear to me that the legislature wished to avoid the section being restricted to rulings on the admissibility of evidence strictly defined. In my view a determination under s 100(1) not to dispense with the notice provisions in relation to tendency evidence is at least a 'decision ... on the admissibility of evidence' and thus within the scope of s 5F(3A).""  4There was no issue that the ruling which his Honour made, that the evidence was not evidence of the guilt of the respondent, substantially weakened the prosecution case.  5In any event if as the respondent argued the Crown was not entitled to bring this appeal relying on s 5F(3A) Whealy J's decision was a judgment or order amendable to appeal under subs(2).  6The appeal was heard by this Court on 15 November 2010. On the following day the Court announced its decision and determined that the appeal should be upheld. The Court ruled that the relevant evidence could be relied upon by the Crown as evidence of guilt of the respondent. The Court indicated that it would publish its reasons at a later date. These are my reasons for joining in that decision. These reasons were prepared before the trial had concluded.  7The respondent was charged with one count of murder and three counts of perjury. The perjury charges relate to allegedly false statements which the respondent made in affidavits filed in connection with two sets of adoption proceedings in relation to two of her other children. The first two perjury counts relate to statements made with respect to the adoption of the first child. The third perjury count relates to statements made in an affidavit dealing with the adoption of her third child.  8The Crown case is that the respondent deliberately kept her pregnancy with Tegan secret. The evidence indicates that her pregnancy was unknown to any of her family and friends or her boyfriend. Shortly prior to the birth the respondent attended at Ryde Hospital where she allegedly told lies to the staff about her background and family situation. The Crown alleges that these lies were told to prevent her family and friends learning of her true situation. The alleged lies include statements about her address, the existence of a midwife and other background matters.  9Tegan was born in Auburn Hospital. After the birth the respondent and the child were transferred to the maternity ward. This occurred at about 10.30 pm on 12 September 1996. The respondent remained in the hospital until some time on 14 September 1996 when she left presumably with the child. Both had been checked by the medical staff and were deemed free to go. The Crown alleges that lies were told to the nursing staff and a social worker before she left the hospital. It is alleged that these lies were again told to avoid others knowing of her true circumstances.  10This appeal is not concerned with any of the alleged lies to which I have referred. The alleged lies which are the subject of the present proceedings relate specifically to what the respondent said she did with the child after leaving the hospital. They were described by Whealy J in the following terms:  ""a. The Perth couple lie  From mid 1999, the accused had been dealing with a helpful and sympathetic employee of Anglicare - Virginia Fung - in connection with the adoption of her third child, Aaron. An unusual set of circumstances had led a man John Borovnik, who worked for DoCS, to learn, unexpectedly and accidentally, that the accused may have had a second child who had been born at Auburn Hospital in 1996. When informed by Mr Borovnik that he was going to notify the police about Tegan's birth, the accused sent a fax to Virginia Fung on 25 October 1999. This fax stated that the accused had handed Tegan over 'to a couple from Perth'. The fax suggested that this couple had 'befriended us' shortly before the birth. She asked Virginia Fung to inform Mr Borovnik of this situation. The Crown has suggested that this was undoubtedly a lie told by the accused. In this regard, it relies on the fact that, during the accused's ERISP interviews, she prevaricated in relation to that explanation. The Crown asserts that this lie might properly be characterised as one showing a consciousness of guilt of the murder of Tegan. Mr Chapple SC, on behalf of the accused, disputes the lie may be used in this way and argues that, if it be a lie, it simply should be restricted to a credibility lie and its use limited in that way.  b. The Andrew Morris lie  The accused told Detective Kehoe, in her first ERISP in 2001, that Tegan had been handed over to Andrew Morris, the natural father. The Crown wishes to argue that this was a lie. If it can demonstrate that it was a lie, it seeks permission to raise before the jury the submission that this lie constitutes an awareness or consciousness of guilt. Mr Chapple SC submits that the Court should not permit that this be done.  c. The Andrew Norris lie  In later ERISPs involving Detective Richard Gaut in 2002, the accused maintained that she handed over the child to the natural father whose name was Andrew Norris. The parties take similarly contesting positions in relation to this alleged lie.  The Crown has further argued, as I have said, that the maintenance of these two lies (regarding Andrew Morris/Norris) is consistent only with the desire to hide the real truth, which was that she had murdered Tegan. To this extent, the 'maintenance' of the alleged lies is relied on as evidence of conduct in consciousness of guilt or, perhaps more accurately, a lack of conduct in that no further or different explanation was proffered. In that latter regard, the Crown, as I mentioned, also relied upon the 'perpetuation' of the Morris/Norris lies as probative to disprove that the accused informally adopted Tegan out to some other unknown person or persons. I shall leave the resolution of the 'conduct of perpetuation' issue to a later stage in this decision.'""  11Whealy J gave a comprehensive and carefully reasoned judgment. His Honour discussed the law relating to lies as evidence of guilt. He referred to and extracted passages from the judgment of Simpson J in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52. I need not repeat them in these reasons. See also Quinlan v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 106 at [15].  12Whealy J also discussed what he described as ""an important qualification"" to the approach described by Simpson J. His Honour said:  ""Where, for example, there is no immediate piece of independent evidence to demonstrate that a particular statement may be a lie, and it is necessary to assess the credibility of the accused and the impugned statement in the light of the entire circumstantial case presented by the Crown to determine whether or not he or she had told the truth, the position is by no means clear cut. The situation is even more critical where the suggested lie is, in truth, the central platform of the defence case, or, as here, it is the defence case itself. In that circumstance, it is important that lies in consciousness of guilt not be left before the jury where the jury would be obliged to engage in circuitous or 'bootstrap' reasoning regarding those lies.""  13His Honour referred to a number of decisions to similar effect: R v Zheng (1995) 83 A Crim R 572; R v ST (1997) 92 A Crim R 390 at 394; R v Mercer (1993) 67 A Crim R 91 at 98; R v Middleton [2001] Crim LR 251; R v Harron [1996] Crim LR 581 at 583; R v Laz (1998) 1 VR 453; R v Russo [2004] VSCA 206; R v Sirillas [2006] VSCA 234.  14In Zheng Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Smart and Studdert JJ agreed, stated that if it was only possible to conclude that an accused had lied by finding that he or she committed the offence with which they have been charged the alleged lie could not be used as evidence of guilt. Of course a finding of guilt of the offence may have the consequence that an accused told a lie but because the lie could only be established by a finding of guilt it was not itself evidence of that guilt. This has been described as ""circular reasoning.""  15Whealy J concluded that the reasoning of Hunt CJ at CL in Zheng was applicable to the present case leading to the conclusion that the alleged lies could not be used as evidence of guilt. With respect to the lies described as the Andrew Morris/Norris lie Whealy J concluded that:  ""A jury could only determine that the Andrew Morris/Norris story was a lie if they were to accept the entirety of the Crown's circumstantial case.""  16Whealy J's reasons include a helpful and comprehensive summary of the evidence which the Crown asserted independently of a finding of guilt proved that the Andrew Morris/Norris account was a lie. It includes evidence that no-one of that name had ever lived at the relevant address or ever visited those premises. The Crown alleged that the respondent made a number of changes or additions to her story including the number of times she had been visited by Andrew and his mother at the hospital and other friends associated with her contact with this person. There is evidence that the respondent displayed a lack of interest in genuinely looking for the place where she claimed she had had a relationship with Andrew Morris/Norris. There was other evidence from intercepted telephone calls of her disinterest in ""hunting down"" Andrew Norris capable of supporting a conclusion that the respondent had lied.  17With respect to this evidence his Honour concluded that, notwithstanding the Crown's assertion that from this evidence the alleged lies could be established that because they did not fit the description of ""immediate pieces of independent evidence capable of demonstrating in a straight forward and simple manner that the defence case is a lie"", the lies could not be relied upon as evidence of her guilt.  18Whealy J also referred to other evidence that the Crown submitted could satisfy the jury of the alleged lies. However, his Honour said that their forensic strengths were variable and concluded that the Crown was seeking to mount a ""bootstrap argument upon bootstrap argument."" His Honour concluded that although there may be, as the Crown argued, a considerable body of evidence that might make the respondent's explanation otherwise unbelievable this was all part of the general circumstantial case made against her by the Crown.  19His Honour ultimately stated:  ""The fact is there is no independent evidence to demonstrate that the accused was telling a lie when she said that she gave the baby to the natural father. One would have to conclude, from the entirety of the circumstantial case generally, that this was a lie. Therein, it seems to me, lies the circularity.""  20Notwithstanding his Honour's careful analysis of the situation I have respectfully come to a different conclusion. His Honour's discussion of the evidence and the explanation of that material given to this Court makes plain that there is a body of evidence from which the jury could conclude that the respondent lied when she said she had given the child to Andrew Morris/Norris. Although it is true that the Crown also relied on that evidence as part of its circumstantial case that does not have the consequence that a conclusion that the respondent lied is dependent on a finding that she murdered Tegan.  21Of course there could be an innocent explanation for her statements, even if the jury finds that she lied. The jury will be reminded of the caution with which they must approach lies. However, his Honour's finding that if the jury is satisfied that the appellant told lies in relation to Andrew Morris/Norris the lie could not be used as evidence of guilt was not open.  22Whealy J considered there was a further reason why the Andrew Morris/Norris lies could not be left as evidence of the respondent's guilt. His Honour said:  ""This leads me to a further reason why I consider that these two lies, in particular, should not be left as lies evidencing consciousness of guilt. The jury will be directed that, if they disbelieve the accused's explanation, they are not to thereby find her guilty of murder. They will be directed, in that situation, simply to put the evidence of that explanation to one side altogether. They will next be required to examine the evidence remaining in the case, including such of the evidence that emerges from her interview with the police as they do accept. They will be then required, having regard to all that evidence, to determine whether the Crown has or has not proved each of the essential ingredients of the murder charge beyond reasonable doubt. If there is a reasonable possibility that any of those ingredients is absent, the Crown will have failed to prove its case and the jury will be bound to acquit.  It would be inconsistent with such a direction, and indeed contrary to it, to then say to a jury, 'If you do not believe her explanation, you may regard that as a lie to be used as evidence of her consciousness of guilt.' Indeed, the Crown's opening reveals that it wishes to go so far as to put to the jury that the lies were told because 'the truth was too terrible to contemplate, namely that she had murdered Tegan.' Such a submission, in this trial, would fly directly in the fact of the Crown's obligation to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt, and the direction to be given to reinforce that obligation.""  23It maybe that there has been an error in the transcription of his Honour's reasons. However, it could not be the case that if the jury disbelieve the respondents' explanation they are simply to put the evidence of that explanation to one side altogether. Instead if the respondent's explanation is disbelieved it would be open to the jury to consider it, with the other evidence when considering her guilt. With respect his Honour's analysis inappropriately separates the alleged lie from the other evidence which may indicate guilt. The critical issue in the analysis is that there is evidence capable of supporting a finding that she lied and such a finding is not dependent upon a finding that the respondent is guilty.  24The DPP conceded before this Court that unless the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent lied when she gave the explanations of what she had done with the child the respondent must be acquitted. This concession was rightly made. Unless the jury is satisfied that she has lied there must logically be a reasonable possibility that the child was not killed by the respondent but given to another person. In this event the Crown would not have negatived a reasonable possibility that the respondent is innocent. But this conclusion does not involve any inconsistency in the Crown case. How the Crown case is ultimately advanced to the jury is a matter for the prosecutor. It may be that he will seek to make much of the alleged lies. But I do not presently understand the Crown case to be confined to the lies. It would seem that there is a body of other evidence of circumstances which the Crown will submit supports a conviction.  25His Honour records the fact that the Crown maintained that the lies would be used as an indispensable link in the chain of reasoning underpinning the Crown case. In a sense to which I have referred this is correct. However, it does not follow that a finding that the respondent lied would lead to a finding that she was guilty of murder. The lie may have been deliberately told but for another reason. For example, it may be that the respondent was seeking to protect the person to whom in truth she gave the child.  26Whealy J discusses the caution which this Court and some academic writers have expressed to be appropriate when the prosecution seeks to use a lie as evidence of guilt ( R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697 at 701; R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234; R v Ray (2003) 57 NSWLR 616; Wood ""Criminal Law Update Court of Criminal Appeal (1999) 4 Judicial Review 217). Although caution is necessary it cannot be allowed to inhibit the Crown from having the benefit of the evidence when that is clearly appropriate. The present is such a case.  27The third lie was referred to as the ""Perth couple lie"". This lie was allegedly told when the respondent was responding to questions with respect to the adoption of her children. Whealy J's discussion of the alleged lie is as follows:  ""I turn now to consider the 'Perth couple' lie. I have earlier described briefly the nature of the situation which led to the accused sending a fax on 25 October 1999 to Virginia Fung. The precise sentences relied on by the Crown appear in the early part of the fax as follows:  'There were three children, obviously I can't lie anymore as the paperwork is there. The middle child lives with a family in Perth although I have not had contact with them in a long time. They befriended me just before I had her and supported us. I am not able to give you many details as I am not sure of them myself ... I am aware that this does not have anything to do with Tahlia's and Aaron's placement and really not your issue but I feel you should know and perhaps pass these details onto John.'  The context of the fax is extremely complicated. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that it essentially arose, as I said earlier, in connection with the adoption of the accused third child, Aaron. In the early phases of the adoption proceedings, the accused has said the father of this child was Duncan Gillies. Later, it became patently obvious to Virginia Fung, particularly after speaking to Duncan Gillies, that he was not the father. The accused then said the father was a man named Aaron Williams with whom she had had a brief relationship in London, and had fallen pregnant to him. The Crown case is that this was in fact a lie, principally because the accused had not been in London at the relevant time. Moreover, DNA testing, many years later, demonstrated that the true father of Aaron was a man named Aaron Howison. He was a friend of the accused's younger brother, with whom she had had a brief relationship in the relevant year. He had no idea that the accused had fallen pregnant and had given birth to his child. Against the background of these extremely complex and multi-layered situations, it is likely that the accused, at the time of writing the fax, was principally concerned with two things. First, to ensure that the adoption of Aaron proceeded as efficaciously as possible, notwithstanding the fact that she had been 'found out' in not telling the truth about the paternity of the child. Secondly, it is as clear as it could be that the accused was endeavouring, in a clumsy and ultimately ineffective way, to prevent her family and friends from finding out about Aaron's birth.  A third complication, however, had arisen. This was the fact, referred to earlier, that John Borovnik had learned unexpectedly that the accused had delivered a second child, who had been born at Auburn Hospital in 1996. It was in the context of that additional fact that the sentences I have quoted above appeared in the fax, Exhibit YY. The fax is a very lengthy document. There are many matters stated in it that are probably untrue. It would be open to the jury to conclude, however, that the overall thrust of the letter was an endeavour by the accused to regain the confidence of Virginia Fung so that Aaron's adoption could proceed and that, as a consequence, her family and friends would not find out about her recent pregnancy and Aaron's birth. In one part of the fax, analysing her own actions over the last six years, the accused said:  'Why did I? I didn't have any support any time I was in this situation. I felt very isolated and alone. People dropped off me when they realised I was going to relinquish the babies. How could I do it? Society says that this is wrong, society says that people who do this must be mad, slutty or cruel. I jut don't agree. Being able to have a beautiful, healthy child is a great gift. Being able to give someone else that opportunity when they can't is a gift as well. I don't think my behaviour itself is actually that bad, it's just the secrecy and dishonesty that comes with it ... I live with these decisions and thoughts every day. I have to live with this for the rest of my life. I constantly feel sick, I sleep two to three hours a night, I'm always on edge. I wish the phone would never ring again. I'm sick of bad news and I'm tired of hiding things from people. I worry constantly that people who don't know me or the situation will find out and I will lose more people.'  The Crown, in its submissions, described this fax as 'very manipulative.' It may well be, although it would be open to the jury to conclude that there are a number of statements made by the accused that are likely to be genuine. However, the principal observation for present purposes is that, in my opinion, its probative value, in the present context, is scarcely more than minimal. It seems to me that the real thrust of the 'Perth couple lie' is that it was an attempt by the accused to fob off any inquiry relating to Tegan, because it was a further complication likely to hold up the adoption of Aaron. It is simply impossible to say that the motive for the lie, if it was a lie, was a realisation of guilt for the offence of murder and a fear that the truth would implicate the accused as the perpetrator of the murder of Tegan. The context of the statements was entirely removed from any consideration of the death of her second child. It is only by assuming that the death of the child by deliberate and violent means has been proved that one can begin to draw the inference suggested by the Crown. Put simply, the suggested lie does not have the capacity to do the work the Crown seeks to ascribe to it. In my opinion, to use the lie as consciousness of guilt of murder would fall foul of the conditions set out in Cook's case. In particular, the lie does not appear to me to be capable, in its context, as being seen as indicating an awareness of guilt of the offence of murder. Nor could it be seen as a lie that was told because the accused realised she was guilty of murdering her daughter. In my view, as I have said, it could not be seen as an implied admission in connection with the central charge in this trial.  Another problem facing the Crown argument is that it is not altogether easy, in the light of the Crown evidence, to demonstrate that the Perth couple story is a lie. The Crown argued, however, that it may be seen to be a lie because the accused herself effectively abandoned it in favour of the Morris/Norris explanation given during the later records of interview. The problem with this argument is that the Crown asserts, with considerable vigour, that the Andrew Morris/Norris story itself is a lie. If the Andrew Morris/Norris story is a lie, as the Crown asserts, does that not leave open the possibility that the Perth couple story may have been the true explanation? It is fair to observe that the Crown has not independently endeavoured to prove that the Perth couple explanation was deliberately false. It is true, of course, that the accused prevaricated in relation to the version given to Virginia Fung when she was later interviewed by the police. But that, of itself, would not prove that the Perth couple story was a lie.""  28It may be as his Honour outlines that there are explanations for this statement which would not lead the jury, if they found the statement to be a lie, to conclude that it provided any significant evidence of her guilt. It may also be, as his Honour indicates, that it may be difficult for the Crown to satisfy the jury that it was a lie.  29However, as I understand the evidence it would be open to the jury to conclude that it was a lie otherwise than because they concluded that the respondent had committed the alleged offence. Although in his Honour's opinion the evidence that this was a lie may be weak does not in my opinion exclude it from being put before the jury. It will be for the jury to decide whether it is a lie and if they reach that conclusion the contribution, if any, which it makes to their verdict.  30The respondent allegedly repeated her lies in relation to Morris/Norris on more than one occasion. The Crown submitted to Whealy J that the respondent accordingly perpetuated her lies and the jury could be directed to approach the later occasions when she allegedly lied in this manner. If it be the case that she made the same or a similar statement on a subsequent occasion each of those occasions must be separately addressed. It may be that on the later occasion that the lie was told merely because, for whatever reason, and that reason may have nothing to do with the death of Tegan (if that has occurred), the respondent was not prepared to acknowledge that she had been untruthful on a previous occasion. In other words she may have felt trapped and found it necessary to repeat the lie. In those circumstances each lie would need to be separately considered and the jury instructed that there could be an innocent explanation for each of the subsequent statements even if the jury found them to be lies.  31SIMPSON J :  On 9 August 2010 Keli Lane (the respondent) was indicted on a charge that, on 14 September 1996, she murdered Tegan Lane.  The indictment also contained three counts of perjury.  The respondent entered pleas of not guilty to all charges.  A jury was empanelled and the trial proceeded.  During the course of the trial, the trial judge, Whealy J (as his Honour then was) made a number of interlocutory rulings with respect to evidence and other matters.  32One of these rulings ( R v Keli Lane [No 13] [2010] NSWSC 1540, 3 November 2010) concerned evidence tendered by the Crown of three statements made by the respondent that the Crown contended to be lies, and lies that the respondent had told because she was conscious that she was guilty of the offence of murder.  Although there was no issue that the evidence of the statements said to have been made by the respondent was admissible, and relevant to the assessment of the general credibility of the respondent, Whealy J refused to allow the Crown to rely upon the statements as evidence indicating consciousness of guilt.  There is a discrete body of law, to which I will come, that governs the use that may be made of evidence of lies as consciousness of guilt.  33On 4 November 2010, during the course of the trial, relying upon s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the DPP"") appealed to this Court against that ruling.  Section 5F(3A) is in the following terms:  ""The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence , but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case."" (italics added)  34Section 5F(5) is in the following terms:  ""The Court of Criminal Appeal:  (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and  (b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against.""  35It was not disputed that the evidence was a significant part of the Crown case, and that its exclusion, for the purpose for which the Crown sought to rely on it, substantially weakened the prosecution's case.  36An issue did, however, arise concerning the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal, and I will return to this at a later point in these reasons.  37This Court heard argument on 15 November 2010 and, on 16 November 2010, made an order allowing the appeal, and vacating the ruling made by Whealy J, and ruled, pursuant to sub-s (5)(b) of s 5F, that the evidence in question was admissible as evidence of the guilt of the respondent on the charge of murder.  38At that point, the Court reserved reasons, but made the following brief statement:  ""1. While according due deference to the position of the trial judge in his appreciation of the factual matrix of the evidence in the trial, this Court is satisfied:  (i) that the use of the evidence as consciousness of guilt does not involve circular reasoning;  (ii) that, while proof that the respondent lied about the disposition of the child by saying that she had handed her over to Andrew Norris/Andrew Morris/the Perth couple is a necessary fact for proof of guilt, it is not sufficient to establish guilt of the respondent.  Before this Court the prosecutor accepted this proposition.  (iii) that there exists a body of evidence from which a jury could conclude beyond reasonable doubt that any of the accounts given by the res pondent concerning:  Andrew Norris;  Andrew Morris;  the Perth couple;  was a lie;  (iv) that, subject to proper directions being given, there would be no confusion arising from the use of the evidence as consciousness of guilt;  (v) that the exis tence of evidence of a large number of lies told by the respondent is not a reason to refuse to admit evidence of particular lies as part of the circumstantial case to prove the guilt of the respondent.  It is not appropriate for the Crown to rely upon the 'perpetuation' of any lie as separate evidence of consciousness of guilt.  In respect of the repetition of a lie each must be treated as separate evidence from which the jury may infer a consciousness of guilt.  In each case the jury will have to be directed as to whether there was a reason for telling the lie other than because it revealed a consciousness of guilt.  For example, the respondent may have considered herself locked into repeating the lie because of her previous lie.""  39These are my reasons for joining in the order that was made and in the statement extracted above.  40It is necessary to begin with an account, as brief as the circumstances permit, of the case the Crown set out to make at trial.  The Crown case at trial  41It is to be remembered that the trial judge's ruling, and the orders of this Court, were made during the course of the trial and before the Crown case was completed.  This outline of the Crown case is drawn partly from evidence already given, and partly from evidence that the Crown anticipated calling.  This Court was told that the Crown case was nearing completion at the time of the hearing.  42The Crown case on the murder charge (the perjury charges are of no present relevance) was that, on 12 September 1996, at Auburn Hospital, the respondent gave birth to a daughter, Tegan Lane (the alleged victim), and that, two days later, on 14 December, she discharged herself and the baby, with the approval of the hospital staff.  The same day, in circumstances the Crown cannot establish, the respondent killed the child and disposed of her body, which has never been found.  In the absence of any direct evidence to prove the murder, the Crown relied upon an extensive and factually interwoven circumstantial case.  I interpolate here that the defence case, as opened to the jury at trial, was that the respondent had, after Tegan's birth, given the child to her natural father, a man who was not, in the opening, named.  43I do not propose to refer to all of the evidence the Crown has tendered, or proposed to tender, for the purpose of establishing its circumstantial case that the respondent murdered Tegan.  I will refer to some items of the evidence.  The majority of what follows is drawn from a helpful summary of evidence provided by the Crown, the accuracy of which (as a statement of the Crown evidence) was not challenged:  on 18 March 1995 the respondent gave birth to a daughter, Tahlia Rose, at King George V Hospital for Women.  Publication of the name of the father of that child is restricted pursuant to the Adoption Act 1965.  None of the father of the child, the respondent's parents or other family, or her friends knew of her pregnancy or the birth of the child;  the respondent was at the time a competitive water polo player, with ambition to compete in the Sydney Olympics;  on 21 March 1995 the respondent surrendered Tahlia for adoption.  The adoption was arranged by a social worker to whom the respondent told a series of lies about her personal circumstances.  (These lies were relied upon by the Crown for credit purposes, but not as consciousness of guilt);  the respondent falsely identified Duncan Gillies as the father of Tahlia; for the purpose of the adoption proceedings, she swore two false affidavits to this effect;  in early 1996 the respondent was again pregnant, this time with Tegan.  At this time she was in a relationship with Duncan Gillies.  Duncan Gillies was unaware of the pregnancy.  The respondent's family and friends were also unaware of the pregnancy;  late in the pregnancy the respondent attended the Ryde Hospital, where she gave a significant amount of false information about her personal circumstances;  the respondent gave birth to Tegan at the Auburn Hospital in the morning of 12 September 1996.  Neither Duncan Gillies, nor the respondent's family and friends, were aware of the birth;  the respondent made a number of false statements to a social worker at Auburn Hospital concerning her personal circumstances;  Tegan's birth was never registered;  the respondent left Auburn Hospital on 14 September 1996, with Tegan.  She arrived at her parents' home that afternoon, without Tegan, was joined by Duncan Gillies, and the couple attended a wedding;  on 16 September 1996 the respondent telephoned the Ryde Domiciliary Midwife Program advising that she would not need their services, as her home midwife (whom she named as Duncan Gillies' mother) would take over her care.  This last statement was false;  on 19 September Tegan was enrolled on the respondent's Medicare card; no claim has ever been made on the card for services of a medical, pharmaceutical or other nature for Tegan;  in August 1998 the respondent became pregnant with a third child.  She inquired about termination, but was told that the pregnancy was too far advanced.  On 21 May 1999 she gave birth to a son whom she named Aaron Jai.  The father of Aaron is known, and gave evidence in the trial.  He was unaware of the respondent's pregnancy and unaware of the baby's birth.  The respondent told a series of lies about her personal circumstances;  the respondent surrendered Aaron for adoption.  In that process she dealt with a social worker employed by the Anglicare Adoption Agency named Virginia Fung, and an employee of the Department of Youth and Community Services (John Borovnik).  In the course of this process she told many lies about her personal circumstances including naming the father of the child as Aaron Williams;  on 13 October 1999 Mr Borovnik discovered that the respondent had given birth to a daughter in September 1996.  He made inquiries of the respondent.  The respondent denied having given birth to a daughter at that time.  Mr Borovnik informed Ms Fung;  Ms Fung asked the respondent if she had given birth to any children other than Tahlia and Aaron; the respondent replied that she had not;  on 18 October the respondent again denied to Mr Borovnik that she had given birth at Auburn Hospital in 1996;  on 25 October 1999, in a letter to Ms Fung, the respondent confessed to having given birth to a daughter.  She wrote:  ""There were 3 children obviously I can't lie anymore as the paperwork is there.  The middle child lives with a family in Perth although I have not had contact with them for a long time.  They befriended me just before I had her and supported us.  I am not able to give you many details as I am not sure of them myself.  If my story isn't unusual enough as it already is!  I know you probably can't believe it but I know that somehow that you know I am now being honest with you.""  44Mr Borovnik reported what he knew to police.  By 2001, police were investigating.  The respondent was interviewed on a number of occasions.  Three interviews, respectively on 14 February 2001, 9 May 2003 and 8 January 2004, were electronically recorded.  In the interview of 14 February 2001 the respondent told Detective Kehoe that she had had a brief affair with a man named Andrew Morris, to whom she had become pregnant, and that, on 14 September 1996, she had given him, as the natural father, the baby.  She said that Andrew Morris was then in relationship with a woman ""Mel"" who had accompanied him when the respondent handed over the child.  They had then driven her to her then residence in Venus Street, Gladesville.  She said that Andrew Morris had lived in Balmain, and she no longer knew his whereabouts.  45In another interview that was not electronically recorded (on 16 October 2002) the respondent identified Andrew Norris as Tegan's father, and gave a different account of some (relatively immaterial) circumstances.  She said that she handed the baby to Andrew Norris at Auburn Hospital, and that she had then travelled home to Venus Street by taxi.  In the course of this interview she named a ""Lisa"" as a person who had known her at the time of Tegan's birth, and had known of her relationship with Andrew Norris, and of her pregnancy.  46In the interview of 9 May 2003 the respondent confirmed to Detectives Gaut and Edgtton that she had previously (on 14 February) misnamed the father of the child (as Andrew Morris), whose correct name (she said) was Andrew Norris, but maintained that she had handed the child to him.  Detectives observed a number of inconsistencies in the account the respondent gave.  In this interview, the respondent claimed that, in referring to ""the Perth family"" (in her letter to Ms Fung), she was referring to ""Andrew and Mel"".  She named ""Lisa"" as Lisa Andreatta.  In subsequent inquiries made of Lisa Andreatta, Ms Andreatta denied any knowledge of Andrew Morris.  47Following that interview, on 19 May 2003, the respondent accompanied Detective Gaut on a drive around the Balmain and Rozelle area, where she had said Andrew Norris lived during the time she knew him, in order to locate his home unit.  The respondent directed Detective Gaut to a unit block at 24 Wisbeach Street in Balmain, which she identified as closely resembling, in many respects, the block in which Andrew Norris had lived; and she identified two of the units as similar to, and possibly being, the unit in which Andrew Norris lived.  Subsequent inquiries made by police revealed that no person by the name of Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris was known to have lived in that block, or in either of the identified units.  48The Crown also relied on evidence obtained by authorised interception of the respondent's telephone conversations after the investigation began.  49Although the Crown evidence includes almost countless lies said to have been told by the respondent, and numerous inconsistencies and discrepancies in accounts she had given concerning the birth of her three children (and there is no issue about the admission into evidence of the great bulk of these lies) only three were advanced by the Crown as evidencing a consciousness of guilt on the part of the respondent.  These were:  (i)the account given by the respondent to Ms Fung, that she had given ""the middle child"" to ""a family in Perth"" with whom she had lost contact (this came to be called ""the Perth couple lie"");  (ii)the account in the interview of 14 February 2001 (and previously) that she had given the child to her natural father, whom she named as Andrew Morris (this came to be called ""the Andrew Morris lie"");  (iii)the later account, given in the interviews of 16 October 2002 and 9 May 2003, that she had given Tegan to her natural father, who she named as Andrew Norris (this came to be called ""the Andrew Norris lie"").  50In my opinion, the ""Andrew Morris lie"" and the ""Andrew Norris lie"" were essentially the same lie.  The substance of what was asserted to be a lie, in each case, was that the respondent had handed Tegan to her natural father.  The change of name added strength to the Crown proposition that the respondent lied in saying that she had handed Tegan to her natural father.  51The evidence relied upon by the Crown to establish the falsity of ""the Perth couple lie"" was, at least in part, as follows.  The respondent had been arranging for the adoption of her third child, Aaron.  In doing so, she was dealing with Mr Borovnik and Ms Fung.  In what Whealy J described as ""an unusual set of circumstances"" (particulars of which were not before this Court) Mr Borovnik discovered that the respondent might have had a second child born at Auburn Hospital in 1996.  He told the respondent that he intended to notify the police of the birth.  On 13 October 1999 he informed Ms Fung of the birth.  Ms Fung asked the respondent if she had given birth to any children other than Tahlia and Aaron; the respondent said that she had not.  On 18 October 1999 Mr Borovnik telephoned the respondent at her place of employment and told her that he had received information that she had given birth to a baby girl at Auburn Hospital on 12 September 1996.  The respondent denied having done so.  On 20 October 1999 the respondent sent by facsimile a letter to Mr Borovnik, asking him not to contact anybody without giving her prior notice.  On 25 October she sent the letter to Ms Fung that has been extracted above, acknowledging that she had in fact had three children; the letter contained the statement that is said to constitute ""the Perth couple lie"", that the respondent had given the child to ""a family in Perth"", with whom she had lost contact.  52Shortly after, the respondent told Ms Fung that she was leaving Sydney for London.  Ms Fung asked for information concerning the second child, to include in materials to be provided to Aaron or his adoptive family.  The respondent said that she would call back but did not.  53She then wrote to Ms Fung, saying that she would send a copy of ""my story"".  The Crown contended that the respondent engaged in evasive conduct, and showed no interest in locating the Perth couple.  That, the Crown suggested, was because the respondent knew that the Perth couple did not exist.  54Further, so far as it appeared in this Court, in order to prove that ""the Perth couple"" account was false, the Crown relied upon the subsequent Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris versions of what had become of Tegan, the absence of any detailed information from the respondent, and what the Crown characterised as prevaricating answers given by the respondent when interviewed.  The answers given to a series of questions in the interview of 9 May - questions 283-321 - amply support that characterisation.  55The evidence upon which the Crown relied to support its assertion that each of the Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris accounts was false was significantly more extensive.  It included inconsistencies in the detail given by the respondent on various occasions on which she spoke of the father of Tegan.  It also included exhaustive investigations by police of individuals with the names Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris, that produced no relevant result; and it included the evidence that the respondent had identified the address which she said closely resembled the unit at Wisbeach Street, Balmain at which she had visited Tegan's father, inquiries in respect of which cast serious doubt upon the respondent's veracity.  The relevant legal principles  56The principles applicable to evidence of lies told by an accused person as evidencing consciousness of guilt were comprehensively spelled out in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193.  They had their origin in Reg v Lucas (Ruth) [1981] QB 720 as summarised (uncontroversially) by McHugh J in Edwards (although in a dissenting judgment as to their application).  They are (I have slightly paraphrased):  (1)the lie must be deliberate;  (2)the lie must relate to a material issue;  (3)the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth;  (4)the statement said to constitute a lie must clearly be shown to be a lie by admission or by evidence; where evidence of the lie is tendered as corroboration of the evidence of a witness, the evidence showing that the statement is a lie must be from a person other than that witness.  57In the joint judgment of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, the following appears:  ""But not every lie told by an accused provides evidence probative of guilt.  It is only if the accused is telling a lie because he perceives that the truth is inconsistent with his innocence that the telling of the lie may constitute evidence against him.  In other words, in telling the lie the accused must be acting as if he were guilty.  It must be a lie which an innocent person would not tell.  That is why the lie must be deliberate.  Telling an untruth inadvertently cannot be indicative of guilt.  And the lie must relate to a material issue because the telling of it must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence with which he is charged.  It must be for that reason that he tells the lie.  To say that the lie must spring from a realisation or consciousness of guilt is really another way of saying the same thing.  It is to say that the accused must be lying because he is conscious that 'if he tells the truth, the truth will convict him'.""  58Underlying the four propositions stated by McHugh J (and echoed in the joint judgment) is an initial proposition that is so obvious that it hardly needs to be stated (and usually is not).  That is that the statement made by the accused said to be a lie is factually false or wrong.  That a statement is factually false or wrong does not necessarily connote that it is a lie - that is what is meant by including in the requirements that it is a deliberate lie.  (Where such evidence has been admitted for the stated purpose, it is always necessary that the trial judge give a direction drawing to the jury's attention possible alternative reasons that the accused person might have lied.  That issue does not presently arise.)  59It was, of course, essential for conviction that the Crown establish, to the satisfaction of the jury, and beyond reasonable doubt, that each of the Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris account, and the Perth couple account, was false.  If there were any reasonable possibility that any one of those accounts was true, then plainly, the Crown could not prove that the respondent murdered the child.  However, while that was a necessary condition for conviction, it was far from a sufficient condition for conviction.  60It is necessary here to make one additional and important point.  The decision in Edwards was primarily concerned with the directions to be given to the jury once the evidence has been admitted, and permitted to be used for the purpose of showing consciousness of guilt.  Whether:  a statement is false;  a false statement is a deliberate lie;  a deliberate lie relates to a material issue;  a deliberate lie was told out of a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth (and to avoid the consequences of that)  are all questions of fact, and within the province of the jury.  The task of the trial judge, in determining whether the evidence may be used in this way, is to determine whether it would be capable of meeting those tests - that is, whether it would be open to the jury to find affirmatively that it did.  If the evidence is capable of meeting those tests, then it is admissible, and, subject to discretionary considerations, or considerations raised by, for example, s 137 of the Evidence Act , the prosecution is entitled to have the evidence admitted as part of its circumstantial case.  If admitted, it is the task of trial judge carefully to direct the jury in accordance with the four propositions stated in Edwards .  The evaluation remains the task of the jury.  61In some cases, factual falsity may be established by, for example, an admission by the accused.  In others, factual falsity may be established by independent evidence of another witness, or, for example, photographs or documentation.  In those cases, factual falsity is proved by direct evidence.  But, like the offence the subject of the indictment, factual falsity of a statement made by an accused person may also be established by circumstantial evidence.  That was the case here.  The Crown sought to prove the factual falsity of the three statements made by the respondent by circumstantial evidence: a circumstantial case within a circumstantial case.  62The circumstantial case relied upon to prove that the respondent's statements about the Perth couple, about Andrew Morris, and about Andrew Norris were lies had some overlap with, but was not entirely co-extensive with, the circumstantial case relied upon to prove the murder.  For example, the Crown relied upon tendency evidence as a circumstance to prove that the respondent murdered Tegan (the tendency evidence was evidence that the respondent had, on one occasion before the birth of Tegan, and on one after, disposed of children by adoption, although on those occasions it was done lawfully).  That evidence could not possibly go to the question of whether or not any of the three asserted lies was in fact a lie.  63As is the case with proof of an offence by circumstantial evidence, it is the cumulative effect of the individual circumstances of which evidence is given that establishes (if the accumulation is sufficient to do so) that a statement was false.  Thus, evidence tending to show that nobody by the name of Andrew Norris or Andrew Morris ever lived at the unit block at Wisbeach Street, Balmain could not, of itself, prove that nobody by either of those names existed; together with other evidence, however, it may make up a sufficient basket of facts to satisfy the jury that that is the case.  64Each of the lies (whether they are seen as three lies, or two lies, one of which was repeated with variation as to name) directly concerned the respondent's disposal of her daughter, as to whose whereabouts the respondent knew inquiries of an official nature (by Mr Borovnik) were being made.  By the time of the second and third lies, she was aware that a serious police investigation was under way.  65There could be no serious dispute but that, if any of the asserted lies was in fact false, it related to a material issue.  Nor, in the circumstances, was there any room for suggesting, of any of the statements found to be in fact false, that it was other than a deliberately told lie.  There was no credible avenue for the respondent to have been mistaken about how she disposed of the child.  In truth, the issues about each of the statements were:  whether it was false; (as demonstrated by evidence);  if so, whether it was motivated by a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth.  66It will be recalled that counsel appearing for the respondent told the jury in opening that the respondent had given the child to the natural father.  That being the case, the falsity of each of the statements assumed critical importance.  That position taken on the part of the respondent, if it were accepted, also necessarily implied that her account to Ms Fung of giving the child to the Perth couple, or family, was false.  It is difficult to see any real room for suggesting that that was other than deliberately false.  It also necessarily suggested that at least one of the statements that the child had been given to Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris was false, although it is not so clear that that statement was deliberately false.  As I have said, the substance of each of those accounts was that the respondent had given the child to her natural father.  The name was of secondary importance.  67The reasons for the trial judge in rejecting the evidence as consciousness of guilt were, essentially, encapsulated in a few paragraphs of a lengthy judgment.  He said that that the respondent gave the baby to the natural father was ""not merely peripheral to, or simply part of"" the defence case, but was the defence case.  He therefore held that a jury could only determine that the Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris story was lie if they were to accept the entirety of the Crown's circumstantial case.  68He rejected the Crown's proposition that numerous pieces of evidence independently proved that the Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris account was a lie, and made reference to some of those items of evidence.  He then said that the recitation of those suggested modes of proof clearly demonstrated that:  ""... they by no means answer the description of immediate pieces of independent evidence capable of demonstrating, in a straightforward and simple manner, that the defence case is a lie.""  69He said that the evidence concerning the residence of Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris at Wisbeach Street, Balmain ""is hardly a matter that is conclusively proved in the Crown case"".  He said that although that evidence may cast doubt upon the respondent's explanation, even considerable doubt, it could not, without the entirety of the Crown's circumstantial case, prove that it should be disbelieved as a reasonable explanation.  70He then recognised that all other matters relied on by the Crown were ""circumstantial matters"" and considered that this gave rise to circular reasoning: he characterized the circular reasoning in the following way:  ""... to argue that those facts can be used to demonstrate that, when she claimed she handed the baby to Andrew Morris/Norris, she must have lied; and that this lie, in turn, may be taken to demonstrate her guilt of the crime of murder.""  71In my opinion, as I have indicated above, there was a considerable circumstantial case upon which the Crown relied to demonstrate that each of the respondent's accounts of what she had done with Tegan was a lie.  This was not, as was suggested, co-extensive with the circumstantial case of murder that the Crown sought to make.  That is not to say that there were not common elements, or that the circumstantial case to prove lies was entirely quarantined from the circumstantial case on murder.  It was therefore not correct to say that the jury could only find the Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris story to be a lie if they accepted the entirety of the Crown case.  It was for the jury to determine whether or not any of the statements was false, and if so whether it was deliberately false; and, finally, whether any statement found to be false was made out of consciousness of guilt of the crime of murder.  72The circularity argument was also advanced in Edwards , and rejected in the joint judgment.  The Court said:  ""... an alleged admission constituted by the telling of a lie may be considered together with the other evidence and for that purpose does not have to be proved to any particular standard of proof.  It may be considered together with the other evidence which as a whole must establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt if the accused is to be convicted ... ordinarily a lie will form part of the body of evidence to be considered by the jury in reaching their conclusion according to the required standard of proof.  The jury do not have to conclude that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt in order to accept that a lie told by him exhibits a consciousness of guilt.  They may accept that evidence without applying any particular standard of proof and conclude that, when they consider it together with the other evidence, the accused is or is not guilty beyond reasonable doubt.""  73Whether the statements made by the respondent were false, whether they were deliberately false, and, if so, whether they were made out of a consciousness of guilt, are three separate and independent questions.  The evidence was available for the jury to make each determination.  It does not necessarily follow, from a finding that the statement that the respondent gave the child to her natural father was false, that it was a deliberate lie; and, even if it were, it does not necessarily follow that the false statement was made because the respondent was conscious of having murdered the child.  That was an inference available to the jury; and, commonsense dictates that it was an obvious inference if they were to make the preliminary findings.  74In my opinion it was incorrect for his Honour to rely upon a finding that doubt about the residence of Andrew Morris or Andrew Norris at Wisbeach Street, Balmain was not a matter ""conclusively"" proved in the Crown case.  That was to separate one aspect of the circumstantial case made in respect of the falsity of the statement, and elevate it to an essential requirement.  Rather, the evidence concerning the Wisbeach Street residence was part of the factual matrix upon which the jury would be invited to find that the Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris story was false.  75Moreover, in my opinion it was an error for his Honour to say that the suggested modes of proof:  ""... by no means answers the description of immediate pieces of independent evidence capable of demonstrating, in a straightforward and simple manner, that the defence case is a lie.""  There is no requirement that evidence of a lie demonstrate ""in a straightforward and simple manner"" that a statement is a lie; there will be occasions where evidence in a Crown case is complex and difficult to follow, but is nevertheless admissible.  76I was, and remain, satisfied that the evidence is clearly capable of meeting the requirements of evidence as consciousness of guilt as succinctly stated by McHugh J in Edwards , and was therefore admissible for that purpose. Since the evidence was, in any event, admissible, no discretionary basis for its exclusion could arise.  Section 137 of the Evidence Act had no application.  In truth, the argument involved the proposed application of s 136, which empowers a court to limit the use of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of it might be unfairly prejudicial, or misleading or confusing.  None of those conditions here existed. For that reason, I joined in the order that the Court made.  Perpetuation  77The Crown also sought to rely upon what it called ""perpetuation"" of the Andrew Morris/Andrew Norris lie.  By this, it meant repetition of the assertion that the respondent had given the child to her natural father (by which ever name).  The Crown identified nine different occasions upon which (in substance) that account had been given by (or on behalf of, in the defence opening) the respondent.  78In my opinion, each such assertion must be treated as an individual and separate asserted lie, and the same tests will apply to each.  As indicated in the short statement made by this Court in making the orders it did, each statement progressively made by the respondent may raise different considerations to be given as to alternative reasons for the lie.  As suggested, the jury needed to consider the possibility that the respondent considered herself locked into a false story.  Jurisdiction  79As indicated above, the Crown, in filing its appeal, originally relied upon sub-s (3A) of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act .  The jurisdiction of this Court under s 5F(3A) depends upon the existence of two circumstances:  a ruling on the admissibility of evidence;  that the ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecutor's case.  The jurisdictional issue arises because, on behalf of the respondent, while the significance of the evidence was recognised, it was contended that his Honour's decision was not a ""decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence"".  That is because, as mentioned above, the evidence was admissible; the debate concerned the use that the Crown wished to make of the evidence.  80The jurisdictional issue having been raised, senior counsel for the Crown sought, and was granted (without opposition) leave to amend the Notice of Appeal in order to rely upon sub-s (2) of s 5F, which is in the following terms:  ""The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.""  81Sub-section (3A) was inserted following a number of decisions of this Court to the effect that sub-s (2) does not permit an appeal against a ruling that evidence is inadmissible: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; R v Bailey (1988) 36 A Crim R 30; R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213; Steffan v R (1993) 30 NSWLR 633.  It was inserted in order to protect the Crown against a final, but erroneous, ruling on evidence against which, if the accused were acquitted, the Crown would have no redress.  The limitation, that the appeal may be brought only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case, was designed, in accordance with the restrictions on s 5F itself, to limit the fragmentation of the criminal process by interlocutory appeal.  82In R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427, Howie J (with whom Santow JA and Bell J agreed) appears to have thought that ""a decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence"" expresses a broader concept than, for example, ""a decision to admit evidence"" (see [32]).  As I have indicated, there was no issue that the evidence here in question was admissible, and no ""decision or ruling"" to admit it was called for.  The decision or ruling was as to the extent of the use that could be made of it - the inferences the Crown could invite the jury to draw from it.  83I have concluded that it is unnecessary finally to determine the basis of jurisdiction.  In my opinion, while it is arguable, on the basis of Harker , that the decision was a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, if it were not that, then it was plainly, within sub-s (2), an interlocutory judgment or order.  Accordingly, the Court had jurisdiction.  84On one view, what Whealy J was asked to do was make an order under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995, which permits the court, in specified circumstances, to limit the use to be made of evidence.  That, in reality, is what his Honour did, although, in the bustle of the trial, no attention was paid to the technicalities of the ruling.  85HOWIE AJ: I agree with Simpson J.  **********

		22 July 2011",2011-07-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757385,R v Aouli [2011] NSWSC 1393,"Judgment  1HIS HONOUR: On 9 May 2011 the offender, Maher Aouli, pleaded guilty to offences of affray and manslaughter.  The offences are against s 93C and ss 18 & 24 respectively of the Crimes Act 1900 and the maximum penalties are imprisonment for 10 years and imprisonment for 25 years.  2On 24 June 2011 I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence before standing the matter over until today.  Facts  3The matter concerns events in the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009 when there was conflict between members of two rival motorcycle clubs, the Hells Angels and the Comanchero.  The offender has acknowledged that he was criminally concerned in an initial incident near Gate 5 of the terminal which gave rise to the charge of affray and that he was also concerned in a second incident a short time later near the check-in area of the departure hall which resulted in the tragic death of Mr Anthony Zervas.  4A statement of agreed facts was tendered before me.  I draw what follows from that document.  5The offender was a full member of the Comanchero.  He was aware, in a general sense, that there had been hostility and enmity between members of the Comanchero and the Hells Angels for some time prior to 22 March 2009.  6There was a hierarchical structure within the Comanchero motorcycle club.  At the time of the incident on 22 March 2009, Mahmoud Hawi was the national president; Daux Ngakuru was the ""commander""; Farres Abounader was the ""road captain""; Tiago Costa was the secretary; Francesco La Rosa was the treasurer; Rui Antao was the ""nominee boss""; and Herb Laupepa was the ""sergeant at arms"".   7Full members of the club, as the offender was, were required to obey instructions from the commander and the national president.  The rules of the club included not speaking with police, not talking about club business outside the club, leaving mobile phones outside meetings, and obeying orders.  Club rules were reduced to writing.  Rule number 1, for instance, was, ""Any display of cowardice will not be tolerated"" .  8On 22 March 2009 the offender travelled on a Qantas flight from Melbourne to Sydney with fellow Comanchero members Mahmoud Hawi, Canan (aka Ishmail) Eken, Christian Menzies and Pomare Pirini.  9By chance, Derek Wainohu, the president of the Hells Angels, happened to be on the same flight and was seen by Comanchero members.  It was this happenstance that triggered the events that took place shortly after the flight landed in Sydney.  Before the flight took off in Melbourne, Mr Hawi directed the offender to call other Comanchero members to attend Sydney airport.  Telephone records show that he called Mr Abounader, the road captain.  Calls were also made by Mr Eken.  Mr Wainohu sent text messages to Hells Angels members in order to have them attend the airport.  10Passengers on the flight observed animosity from the Comanchero members towards Mr Wainohu before the flight took off.  Most of this emanated from Mr Hawi.  There is no evidence that the offender was involved but he was aware of it.  11Seven Comanchero members arrived at the airport.   Five of them went through to Gate 5 whilst two of them, Mr Abounader and Usama Potrus, remained outside the secure area.  12Seven Hells Angels members or associates, including the deceased, also arrived.  Two of them, Tom Baker and David Padovan, went to Gate 5.  The other five remained in the non-secure area.   13The offender telephoned Mr Abounader once more.  This was at 1.30pm, shortly after the flight landed.  The Gate 5 affray  14The five Comanchero members who had been on the flight disembarked at Gate 5 and met up with the five who had proceeded through security screening.   Similarly, Mr Wainohu met up with Mr Baker and Mr Padovan.  In all, there were 10 Comanchero members and 3 Hells Angels members in the terminal in the vicinity of Gate 5.  15Mr Hawi confronted Mr Wainohu.  There was a short verbal argument before Mr Wainohu was punched, causing him to fall to the ground.  Members of the Comanchero were then observed to chase and assault Mr Padovan.  The affray escalated into violent punching and kicking of Mr Padovan by Comanchero members.  The other two Hells Angels, Messrs Wainohu and Baker, were not seen to engage in any violence.  The fighting resulted in Mr Padovan losing his shirt.  At one stage he was on the ground being punched and kicked by numerous Comanchero members.  The offender was involved as part of the moving group chasing Mr Padovan at Gate 5, but there is no evidence that he punched or kicked Mr Padovan whilst he was on the ground.  16None of the participants in the affray received serious injuries.  There were, however, a large number of members of the public at Gate 5 at the time, including children and elderly people.  The offender accepts that those who witnessed the affray were put in fear by his actions and those of his fellow Comanchero members.   17A small part of the affray was captured by a CCTV camera inside a bookshop.  It shows the group of Comanchero moving past the shop as they were assaulting Mr Padovan.  The offender is seen in this footage but he was some distance behind the pursuing pack and he had a bag slung over his shoulder.  18Mr Padovan re-joined Mr Wainohu and Mr Baker at the conclusion of the fighting.  Mr Hawi pointed and yelled out threats, including the words, ""You're fucking dead"" .   19This incident, from the initial confrontation between Messrs Hawi and Wainohu until the utterance of threats by Mr Hawi, occurred within less than three minutes.  20The 10 Comanchero members then walked towards the exit and as they did so the offender once again called Mr Abounader.  When the group emerged into the departure hall they met up with Messrs Abounader and Potrus who had been waiting in the vicinity of the escalators leading down to the baggage claim level.  The confrontation in the check-in area  21The offender veered to the right towards the escalators but almost immediately rejoined the group as the now 12 Comanchero members moved quickly towards a group of 5 Hells Angels members and associates, including the deceased, who were waiting in the departure hall in the vicinity of the furthest of 20 economy class check-in counters.  CCTV footage shows that when the offender rejoined the group after his brief movement towards the escalators, he was at the front of the group as it proceeded into the departure hall towards the Hells Angels members.   22The Comanchero members passed 14 of the check-in counters and covered a distance of about 73 metres to the point where they met up with the deceased and the Hells Angels members.  23There was a short verbal argument before the fighting commenced.  Witnesses described the two sides fighting each other and ""punches flying everywhere"".  There is conflicting evidence as to precisely how the fighting started.  The witnesses SP and AL, two of the Comanchero members who have pleaded guilty and have agreed to give evidence for the Crown, gave evidence at the committal hearing that the fight started when the deceased either punched or stabbed at Mr Hawi.  However, none of the eyewitnesses saw the deceased with a weapon.  24It is common ground that the question of precisely how the fighting started does not need to be resolved.  The offender has acknowledged by his plea that as part of his common purpose with others to intimidate one or more of the Hells Angels, he contemplated the possibility that an unlawful and dangerous act would be committed and that such an act carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury.  25After the fight erupted behind the check-in counters it continued with the participants moving to the area in front of the counters.  The offender came through but towards the rear of the moving group of Comanchero members and the Crown accepts that he was not fighting.   26Eyewitness descriptions include that the fighting was between two groups with more men in one group than the other.  There are references to it being an ""all in brawl"" with ""everybody punching"".  Bollards used to guide the queuing of passengers in front of the check-in counters were taken up and used as weapons.   These bollards weigh about 12 kilograms each.  There were a number of fights taking place simultaneously, the attack upon the deceased being one of them.  27The offender accepts that the deceased died as a result of the actions of others in the fighting, but he has not nominated any of the individual participants who caused the death.  The Crown contends that it was Messrs Hawi, Menzies and Abounader who assaulted the deceased towards the end of the fighting.  Eyewitnesses vary in their accounts from there being anywhere between two to seven persons involved in the fatal assault.  28CCTV footage from a camera focused just outside the area of the main action shows the offender stepping back out of the area where the brawl was occurring and then running back in to it.  It shows that he still had a bag slung over his shoulder.   29The Crown accepts that there is no evidence that the offender committed any physical acts during the brawl.  He was present whilst it was going on, but the Crown accepts that he was not willing to physically assist in it.   30The fighting was relatively brief.  It was over in no more than two minutes.   31Mr Zervas died from the combined effects of blunt force injuries to the head and stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.  There were three stab wounds, at least one inflicted by a pair of scissors.  They caused injuries to the liver, the stomach and one of the lungs and caused significant internal bleeding.  The head injuries were severe.  They included extensive fracturing at the base of the skull, bleeding over the surface of the brain and bruising of the brain tissue.  32The offender fled in a taxi with Messrs Eken, Kisacanin and Pirini.  He made calls to Mr Abounader, SP and Mr La Rosa before the taxi was stopped by police and the occupants were arrested at Brighton-Le-Sands a short time later.   33The offender was taken to Mascot police station.  He declined to be interviewed.  He was charged with riot and affray.  A charge of murder was preferred on 11 August 2009.   34The offender has been at liberty for 5 days since his initial arrest and it is agreed that if I am to back-date sentences, then that should be to 27 March 2009.  Alternatively, if I am to give credit for pre-sentence custody by reducing sentences, the allowance should be for 841 days.  Seriousness of the offences  35I have previously sentenced Messrs Pirini and La Rosa for affray and manslaughter.  I said when I sentenced them, and reiterate now, that it is important to stress that I am not sentencing the offender for directly causing the death of the deceased.  I am not sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise that had as its object the doing of an act with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm.  I am not sentencing him for his participation in a joint enterprise with the contemplation that the commission of murder was a possible occurrence.  36For the affray, the offender is being sentenced for his threatening unlawful violence towards one or more members or associates of the Hells Angels by being part of the moving group of Comanchero members in that incident.  This affray was committed in front of members of the general public in circumstances that caused those members of reasonable firmness to fear for their personal safety.   37It is significant that all that is necessary for the offence to be committed is that the conduct ""would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety"" and that it is not necessary that such a person actually be, or be likely to be, present:  s 93C(4) Crimes Act .  Further, the offence may be committed in private as well as in public places:  s 93C(5).  In this case, of course, the offence was committed in a very public place and there were a significant number of people present.  Further, it is an agreed fact that the affray did in fact cause those of them who were of reasonable firmness to fear for their personal safety.   38In the light of submissions that were made on the offender's behalf by Ms Francis of counsel, it is important to also recognise that the agreed facts are that the offender threatened unlawful violence ""along with his fellow Comanchero members"".  In the light of this, an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence cannot be made solely upon an examination of the actual role played by the offender.  The ""conduct of them taken together ... must be considered"":  s 93C(2).  39I acknowledge that the affray was relatively short-lived and that the offender's role was less than that of other participants.  He did not engage in any of the physical violence.  These features were at the heart of the submission by Ms Francis that if this was the only offence for which he was to be dealt with, it would not attract a full-time custodial sentence.  40I do not accept that submission.  The offence involved the offender engaging in conduct with nine of his Comanchero associates that struck fear in a significant number of members of the public in a place where they were entitled to feel safe and secure.  It was an agreed fact that there were a large number of persons in the vicinity and that they included children and elderly people.  It cannot be ignored, as well, that the offender played a role in having further Comanchero members attend the airport, adding numbers to the five who were on the flight.  The matter is of quite some seriousness.  41The starting point in assessing the gravity of an offence of manslaughter is always to recognise that it involves the unlawful taking of a human life.  There are, however, a wide variety of ways in which the crime of manslaughter can be committed and there are an equally wide variety of ways in which an offender may be culpable.  42For the manslaughter, the offender is being sentenced for his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to assault, by way of intimidation, one or more members or associates of the Hells Angels, a rival motorcycle gang.  He contemplated the possibility that an unlawful and dangerous act, namely a physical assault, would take place.  It is accepted that this was an assault that carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury.  Obviously, the physical assault that he contemplated might possibly occur was not something trivial, given that the offender acknowledges that a reasonable person in his position would have appreciated that serious injury was at risk.  43Ms Francis submitted that the level of risk associated with the contemplated unlawful and dangerous act was a relevant matter in the assessment of objective seriousness.  I accept that if an offender contemplates that in the course of a joint criminal enterprise an act will be committed which carries a very high risk of serious injury, the offence would be more serious for that reason.  In the present case, the offender contemplated the possibility of an assault being committed by at least one of his Comanchero associates.  A number of these men were very large and powerfully built.  The contemplated assault was upon one or more members of an opposing motorcycle club with which there was a known history of hostility.  The offender had just witnessed the national president of his club punch the president of the Hells Angels, causing him to fall to the ground.  He had then witnessed his companions punching and kicking another Hells Angels member after that man was assaulted and then chased, caught and brought to the ground.  In short, the level of risk associated with the contemplated unlawful and dangerous act was far from insignificant.  44The incident in the departure hall occurred in a very short period of time. I accept that, at least in so far as this offender was concerned, it was not an event which was anticipated.  Indeed, the fact that he first headed towards the escalators down to the baggage carousals when he emerged from the secure area indicates that he quite likely thought that the affray was the end of the confrontation with the Hells Angels.  However, it is notable that he did not waste any time rejoining his companions when the five Hells Angels waiting further inside the departure hall were seen.  The offender was amongst the Comanchero group of 12, at the front at least initially, when they quickly advanced over a considerable distance towards their clearly outnumbered rivals.   45As with the affray, the location in which the second incident occurred is highly relevant.  The level of violence being perpetrated in amongst airport staff and the travelling public was of a very high order.  The offender did not desist when he obviously saw this.  Although he did not participate in it, and the Crown accepts that he was not willing to assist, the CCTV footage shows him momentarily stepping away from the activity and then running back towards it.   He then fled the scene in a taxi with three of his companions.  It is right that the offender should feel sorry for not only the deceased's family but also for ""all of those men, women and children"" who were present.  In his affidavit he advances an apology to these people, acknowledging that, aside from the deceased's family, ""other people's lives have been changed as a result of having witnessed the events"".  As he rightly put it, ""No-one ... should have been subjected to the violence that took place on that day"".   46The role that the offender played was less than others.  Its seriousness relative to the roles played by the others whom I have sentenced will be considered later.  However, my conclusion is that the offence remains a serious one.  Denunciation, punishment and deterrence  47It is appropriate that I reiterate some other things I said in the course of sentencing Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa.  Members of the community have an entitlement to feel safe and secure in public places.  The selfish and mindless arrogance of those who perpetrate extreme levels of violence for their own ends with complete disregard for others warrants the strongest condemnation.   This includes those who are prepared to associate themselves with such violence, even though not directly participating,  48It is necessary in the assessment of sentence to denounce the offender's conduct.  It must be made clear to him, and others who may contemplate acting in such a way, that such conduct will be met with condign punishment.  Aggressive and violent conduct between rival gang members in public places will not be tolerated, the more so where there is an appreciable risk of somebody suffering serious injury.  That risk, in what occurred in this case in the departure hall, was high indeed.  The offender must be punished and made accountable for his part in this tragic affair.  Subjective features  49The offender was born in 1981.  He was aged 28 at the time of the offences and is 30 now.  50He has committed criminal offences in the past.  At the Downing Centre Local Court on 18 June 2008 he was convicted and fined for an offence of knowingly making a statement that was misleading in a material particular. On the same occasion he was placed on a recognizance but not convicted for an offence of importing prohibited imports.  He said in his evidence that this involved steroids for personal use.  51Of more significance, on 12 November 2009 he received an 8 month suspended sentence of imprisonment in the District Court for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company.  He was initially charged with aggravated robbery in respect of that matter and he was on bail for it at the time of the incident at the airport on 22 March 2009.  That is a significant aggravating factor that must be taken into account.  I was informed that at the time of the commission of that offence the offender was on bail in respect of charges of affray and assault with intent to participate in the criminal activity of a criminal group.  Those charges were subsequently dismissed.  I do not regard this feature as being of any additional significance.   52The agreed facts in the District Court matter were tendered before me by the Crown.  They indicate that there was a business dispute concerning the supply of motor vehicle tyres between a wholesaler and two retailers.  The offender was one of five men who went to see the wholesaler one day.  The wholesaler was punched and kicked.  A sixth man arrived and the assault continued for two to three hours.  The offender did not participate in the physical violence but it was an agreed fact that he shared a common purpose with the other offenders and he was ready to assist in the assault if required.  The offender agreed in his evidence that one of the two retailers involved in the dispute was a man who was an associate of the Comanchero.  He claimed, however, that this had nothing to do with his own involvement in the matter.  I did not find his evidence on the topic to be very convincing.  53Evidence was tendered before me by Ms Francis as to the offender's personal circumstances.  It comprised affidavits by himself and three of his sisters, a handwritten letter by himself, various testimonials and a report by Ms Anna Robilliard, forensic psychologist.  54The offender was born in Lebanon.  He came to Australia with his family in 1985.  He is the eldest of seven children.  His youngest sibling is a 16 year old school student.  The other siblings are aged 20 to 27 and are all in employment, as is his father.  His mother is said to suffer from a variety of physical and mental ailments.  Only his eldest brother lives independently;  the offender and the rest of his brothers and sisters still reside at home at Casula in Housing Department accommodation.  By all accounts the family is stable and close knit and they are deeply saddened by the offender's incarceration.  Celebrations of significant family events have either been deferred or have not taken place because of his absence.  55As the eldest sibling the offender accepted considerable responsibility for his brothers and sisters as they were growing up, particularly with his father working and his mother not having a driver's licence.  He contributed towards many household expenses as well.  Affidavits by three of his sisters have a common theme of describing him as a role model.  56The offender completed the Higher School Certificate in 1998.  He worked part-time in his last two years of school.  He has since been actively involved with employment, often holding a full-time job as well as a second job. He has worked in security, as a cleaner, domestic cable installer and as an electrician.  He lost his security licence following his conviction in November 2009.  He has work available to him upon his release.  He aspires to start his own business doing painting and electrical maintenance work.   57He purchased an investment property at Bankstown in about 2002.  The property is leased and this has enabled him, with some assistance from his family, to meet the mortgage repayments since being in custody.   58Certificates attesting to charitable donations to Muslim Aid Australia were annexed to the offender's affidavit.  He said that he donated $100 per month for projects such as the provision of clean water to impoverished people in Cambodia.   59The offender has had an interest in bikes since he was young.  He bought his first road bike in about 2002 so that he could go riding with his friend, Farres Abounader, whom he has known since primary school.  It was Mr Abounader who introduced the offender to Mahmoud Hawi and other Comanchero members at a wedding in either 2005 or 2006.  The offender joined the Comanchero in 2006 after friends that he used to ride with had joined.  He described life with the Comanchero thus:  When I joined the Comanchero I would often go riding with the boys and we would get together at BBQ's, birthday parties and children's birthday parties.  It was like a big family.  60In a curious juxtaposition with that rather benign description of the Comanchero, the offender also said that being a member made him feel "" tough "".   61The offender was romantically involved with Mr Hawi's sister-in-law for a number of years and they became engaged about a year before his arrest.  The relationship, however, ceased about 6 months ago.  He said that she never approved of the Comanchero.   62The offender also ceased his relationship with the Comanchero in recent times.  There have been no recriminations.  He said, "" I've spoken about it to the boys from the club and they said it's all good"" .   63Various expressions of remorse are to be found in the evidence.  I earlier referred to the offender's regret for the fact that so many people had to witness the violence.  I accept that the offender regrets his involvement in what happened and that he has an appreciation and empathy for the grief undoubtedly experienced by the deceased's mother and family.   64The offender also gave evidence about his desire to change.  Forsaking his membership of the Comanchero is a start.  He said in his affidavit that he has "" drawn a line in the sand and want to put the past behind me and move forward in my life for the better "".   Having spent two years in custody, he says that he realises that he needs to change in order to enjoy what life has to offer.  He is fortunate in this respect to have a strongly supportive family.   65Ms Robilliard assessed the offender's physical and mental health as stable and reasonable in the circumstances.  She detected that he was highly anxious and had symptoms of depression.  I accept that, in part, this is a result of his realisation of his role in such horrifyingly violent events that occurred at the airport and his remorse for the death of the deceased.  I suspect that this will resolve to some extent once he is sentenced and his future is clearer.   There are no substance abuse issues and, although Ms Robilliard suggests that the offender would benefit from committing to psychotherapy, it does not appear to be strongly indicated.   66The testimonials that were tendered contain expressions of various good qualities that the offender exhibits.  They include that he is kind, caring, polite, well-spoken, honest, trustworthy, reliable, hardworking and highly respected.  I accept that, aside from his previous offences and his involvement with the Comanchero, he has generally been a person of good character.  Specific mitigating features  67As I indicated earlier, the offender entered pleas of guilty to affray, and manslaughter as an alternative to murder, on 9 May 2011.  In his affidavit he said that he instructed his solicitor that he would plead guilty to affray late last year.  It seems safe to assume that such a plea was not acceptable to the Crown.  He gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence to the effect that he readily agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter as soon as his counsel informed him of the factual basis that the Crown was prepared to accept.   I am aware that negotiations between the Crown and the offender's representatives took place following my sentencing of Mr Pirini on 18 March 2011.   68Ms Francis submitted on behalf of the offender that there should be a reduction of his sentence of 15 to 20 per cent to reflect the utilitarian benefit of the pleas.  The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the reduction should be in the range of 10 to 12.5 per cent.   69The pleas were entered on the trial date, although the offender's intentions were known before that date.  Ordinarily, such a late plea of guilty would attract a reduction of 10 per cent.  The present case has the additional element of the prospective trial being lengthy and, by virtue of the number of accused and the number of prosecution witnesses, rather complex.  I propose to allow for a reduction of 12.5 per cent.   70There are a number of other statutory mitigating factors that I must take into account.  I am satisfied that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.  Renouncement of his membership of the Comanchero, his close and supportive family and his strong work ethic are particular features I have taken into account in respect of those findings.  71I am also satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful.  This is evident not only from what he has said to the court directly on the subject but also from what he is reported to have said to others.  Sentencing of co-offenders  72AL, a Comanchero member, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to charges of affray and riot.  He was sentenced by Charteris DCJ on 17 June 2010 to a total term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 9 months.  The starting point for the affray sentence was 3 years and for the riot sentence was 6 years.  These were reduced by 55 per cent on account of the pleas of guilty and assistance to authorities.  73SP, another Comanchero member, also pleaded guilty in the Local Court to charges of affray and riot and was sentenced by Charteris DCJ on 18 June 2010.  The sentence imposed was in identical terms to that imposed upon AL except for the commencement date.  His Honour allowed a reduction of 55 percent in his case as well.  74It is unnecessary to refer to the sentencing of AL and SP in any further detail.  I undertook that task in sentencing Mr Pirini on 18 March 2011 and, whilst the sentences imposed upon AL and SP are not irrelevant, it is the sentences imposed upon Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa that are more directly relevant.  75Mr Pirini had been committed for trial for the same charges as the offender but entered pleas of guilty to manslaughter and affray on arraignment on 16 December 2010.  The facts as to his offending included that he had been a passenger on the flight from Melbourne with his four Comanchero colleagues.  He was aware of some aggression being shown on the plane towards Mr Wainohu, but not the extent of it.  He was involved in ""scuffles"" during the Gate 5 affray.  The only physical activity in which he was involved during the subsequent riot in the check-in area was to confront, but not land a blow upon, a Hells Angels member who was menacing him with a bollard.  76Mr Pirini was aged 21 at the time of the offences. There were no previous convictions of significance.  He had only been a member of the Comanchero motorcycle club for about a year.  There was no suggestion that he was involved in any criminal activity.  He regarded it as ""just a bunch of boys who rode around on bikes, all hanging out together"".  He had a good employment history and support from his partner and extended family.  Since going into custody he had returned to his Christian faith and renounced his Comanchero membership.  There was evidence that he was a loyal, hardworking, quiet, respectful, humble, gentle and well-mannered young man.  77I specifically found in Mr Pirini's favour that he was of prior good character and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  I was particularly well-satisfied that he was deeply and genuinely remorseful. I found special circumstances for reducing the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  78Mr Pirini received a fixed term of 2 years 2 months for the affray (starting point 2 years 8 months) and a sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years for the manslaughter (starting point 7 years 6 months).  The sentences were partially accumulated so that the total term was 6 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 3 years 6 months.   79Mr La Rosa was also committed for trial for the same charges as the offender but entered pleas of guilty to manslaughter and affray on 8 April 2011.  Mr La Rosa was one of the Comanchero members who heeded the call to come to the airport.  He, like the present offender, was involved in the affray but was not directly involved in any of the fighting.  The agreed facts in his case in respect of the manslaughter were to the effect that he was a party to a joint enterprise to assault Hells Angels members.  He did not commit any physical acts of violence but he was willing to assist if required.   80Mr La Rosa was aged 37 at the time of the offences.  He had no previous convictions of significance.  However, he was on bail in respect of a driving offence, a matter which I took into account as an aggravating feature.  Mr La Rosa joined the Comanchero in about 2003 and became the treasurer.  There was no evidence that he had been involved in any criminal activity in that context.   He had a history of regular employment.  He was generous in respect of charitable donations.  Mr Tim Watson-Munro, forensic psychologist, assessed Mr La Rosa as having long-standing issues with depression, anxiety and low self esteem.  These issues stemmed from his suffering from morbid obesity.  Mr Watson-Munro's opinion was that he required treatment in respect of his significant level of unresolved psychological distress.   81I found in Mr La Rosa's favour that he had no significant record of previous convictions and was of prior good character.   I was satisfied that he was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  He was genuinely remorseful.   For the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty I reduced the sentence I otherwise would have imposed by 15 per cent.   82Mr La Rosa received a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years 4 months for the affray (starting point of 2 years 9 months) and a sentence of 6 years 7 months (starting point 7 years 9 months) for the manslaughter.  The sentences were partially accumulated so that the total term was 7 years 1 month with a non-parole component of 3 years 9 months.   83I do not intend to isolate each and every one of the similarities and differences between the present case and those concerning Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa.  Three matters do, however, stand out.   84The first is that the offender was involved in the activity that brought about the attendance at the airport of greater numbers of Comancheros.  He was directed by Mr Hawi to ""call other Comanchero to attend"" the airport.  He called Mr Abounader before the flight took off in Melbourne.  By way of contrast, Mr Pirini was not involved in summoning reinforcements.  He was generally aware of the hostility directed towards Mr Wainohu, but seems to have been somewhat ambivalent about it, did not participate in it, and slept for most of the flight.   85The second matter is that in the affray, unlike Mr Pirini, but like Mr La Rosa, the offender was part of the moving group of Comanchero participants but was not otherwise responsible for any physical act of violence.  This is not a point of very great distinction.  The seriousness of the offence also lies in a number of other factors which I have discussed earlier and, although Mr Pirini was physically involved, it was to a relatively minor extent (""scuffles"").   86The third matter is more significant.  In respect of the manslaughter, Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa were parties to a joint enterprise to physically assault Hells Angels members.  Mr Pirini was directly involved in a fight with one Hells Angels member, albeit in a defensive way and he did not land a blow.  He was otherwise willing to assist as required.  Mr La Rosa did not physically participate at all, but he, too, was willing to assist as required.  The agreed facts in respect of the present offender, on the other hand, are that he was a participant in a joint enterprise to assault by way of intimidation, not physically, and he was not willing to assist in any physical assault.   87I do not regard the seriousness of the affray insofar as it concerns the offender as being appreciably different from the assessment I made with respect to Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa.  I do, however, find that the seriousness of the manslaughter offence for him is less than it was in respect of those two.   The Crown accepted that this was so.   88The subjective circumstances of the three cases have a number of distinguishing features.  It is impossible to isolate and evaluate the relative weight to be assigned to every such feature but there are some which bear mention.  In the offender's case, he has a criminal record of greater significance than the other two.  The aggravating factor of being on conditional liberty should be given a little more weight in his case than in Mr La Rosa's case on account of the matter for which he was on bail being one involving violence.  There is also the different assessments of the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty to be taken into account.   89Balancing all of the relevant considerations, I have concluded that the starting point for the sentence to be imposed for the offence of affray should be similar to that which applied in the cases of Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa.  The starting point for the sentence for manslaughter should be less.  Other sentencing considerations  90It is necessary to determine sentences for the individual offences and then to determine whether they should be served concurrently or otherwise.  That determination is made with the principle of totality in mind.   91The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there should be some level of partial accumulation of the sentences because there were two distinct offences committed some distance apart.  The affray at Gate 5 had ended but instead of the Comanchero members leaving it at that and proceeding downstairs to the arrivals hall to collect baggage and leave the terminal, they proceeded through to the departure hall to take on the Hells Angels in greater numbers.  Indeed, the offender was initially intent on proceeding downstairs but quickly re-joined his companions.  There is no suggestion that he did so anything other than willingly.   92Ms Francis, on the other hand, submitted that there should be complete concurrency.  This submission was based upon her contention that the affray offence was insufficiently serious to warrant any discrete custodial imposition.   I do not accept that this is the case.  The factors I identified earlier in my description of the seriousness of the matter are such that if this offence stood alone it would indeed warrant a full-time custodial sentence.  For the reasons identified by the Crown Prosecutor I propose to order that there be some partial accumulation along the lines of that which was ordered in the cases of Mr Pirini and Mr La Rosa.   93Ms Francis referred to some other first instance sentencing judgments and made submissions as to those features within them that were comparable,  and those which could be contrasted, with the present case.  With respect, I found them to be of little assistance.  The objective facts, and the personal circumstances of the offender, in each of the cases were not identical and they brought a judge to exercise the sentencing discretion in a particular way.  The present case is quite unique, involving as it does two very violent confrontations between rival outlaw motorcycle gang members in the midst of large numbers of members of the public, including children and the elderly, in an environment normally regarded as safe and secure.  94I do not propose to set a non-parole period for the affray sentence as there would be no utility in doing so.  My view as to the correct construction of s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is to be found in the other sentencing judgments and does not need to be repeated.   95Ms Francis submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  I accept that submission.  The offender has a sound history of employment and his personal and family lifestyle (putting aside his Comanchero involvement) has been quite stable.  Exposure to a significant period of full-time imprisonment carries a risk that there may be difficulties in resuming such a life.  In this regard I am particularly mindful of the need for him to establish social contacts that do not include his former Comanchero associates.   96Finally, it was submitted that I should take into account the time to date that the offender has been in custody and reduce the sentence I impose by an equivalent period.  It was submitted that this would produce a sentence that would carry with it an entitlement to parole release, as opposed to an eligibility that would need to be considered by the Parole Authority.  Whilst I acknowledge that I have a discretion in this respect, I do not propose to follow such a course.  In my view, the consideration that there should be a sentence which openly and transparently demonstrates the seriousness with which the offences are regarded, balanced appropriately against all of the other circumstances of the case, should prevail.  SENTENCE  On each:  Convicted  Affray:  Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years 5 months.  The sentence is to date from 27 March 2009 and expire on 26 August 2011.  Manslaughter: Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years 8 months.  The sentence is to date from 27 September 2009. The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 26 September 2012.  The total term will expire on 26 May 2015.  That is a total sentence of 6 years 2 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.  The sentence of 2 years 5 months for the affray, but for the offender's plea of guilty, would have been one of 2 years 9 months.  The sentence of 5 years 8 months for the manslaughter, but for the offender's plea of guilty, would have been one of 6 years 6 months.  **********

2757390,Ollis v R [2011] NSWCCA 155,"Judgment 

1MACFARLAN JA : On 31 March 2009, at the conclusion of a trial in the District Court before McLauchlan ADCJ and a jury of 12, Scott John Ollis (""the appellant"") was convicted upon the following charges to which he had pleaded not guilty: 

""1. On 4 September 2005, at SYDNEY in the State of New South Wales, [the Appellant] detained [the Complainant], without her consent and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely, to have sexual intercourse with [the Complainant]. 

2. On 4 September 2005, at SYDNEY, in the State of New South Wales, [the Appellant] did have sexual intercourse with [the Complainant], without the consent of [the Complainant] and knowing she was not consenting. 

3. On 4 September 2005, at SYDNEY, in the State of New South Wales, [the Appellant] did have sexual intercourse with [the Complainant], without the consent of [the Complainant] and knowing she was not consenting. 

4. On 4 September 2005, at SYDNEY, in the State of New South Wales, [the Appellant] did have sexual intercourse with [the Complainant], without the consent of [the Complainant] and knowing she was not consenting"". 

2On 25 February 2010 the trial judge imposed the following sentences upon the appellant: 

""Count 1: Fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to commence on 11 June 2014 and expire on 10 June 2015. 

Counts 2&3: On each count imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 11 December 2009 and expire on 10 December 2014 with a non-parole period of 4 years to expire on 10 December 2013. 

Count 4: Imprisonment for 6 years to commence on 11 December 2009 and expire on 10 December 2015 with a non-parole period of 5 years to expire on 10 December 2014"". 

3The appellant appealed against his convictions upon the ground that they are ""not supported by the evidence"". This ground invokes the power conferred upon this Court by s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to allow an appeal if the Court ""is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"". 

4In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13, French CJ, Gummow and Keifel JJ described the principles to be applied in determining an appeal on this ground as follows: 

""11. It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen ([1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493) by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ: 

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty'. 

12. This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen ([2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 623-624) McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'. 

13. The starting point in the application of s 6(1 ) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses ( M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ). However, the joint judgment in M went on to say [at 494]. 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred'. 

... 

14. In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA , the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality' ( Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ). In M , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated [at 492-493]: 

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'"". 

5Later in the joint judgment of French CJ, Gummow and Kieffel JJ, their Honours referred to the ""central question"" for the Court of Criminal Appeal as being ""whether on the evidence the Court was satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences"" (at [20]). 

THE COMPLAINANT'S EVIDENCE 

6On 4 September 2005 the complainant was a 17 year old student from Japan who had been in Australia for about 20 weeks. During this period she had been studying to improve her limited command of English before commencing attendance at a high school in Bathurst. On the morning of 4 September 2005 she travelled by train from Woy Woy to Central Station, to catch a train to Bathurst to start her attendance at the school. Whilst at Central Station she was approached by the appellant, who was then aged 28 and whom she had not previously met. She accepted the appellant's offer to help her with her luggage, which included a large suitcase, a guitar, a backpack and a handbag. They talked as they walked towards the platform and the appellant helped the complainant to put her luggage on the train. Whilst waiting for the train to leave they sat on a bench on the platform and talked further. The appellant indicated to her that he had been to Japan and that he was able to speak some Japanese. The complainant gave evidence that she asked for the appellant's mobile phone number at this time ""because he is being nice to me"" (Transcript p 19). 

7The complainant said that whilst she was talking with the appellant on the railway platform the appellant said, in Japanese, words to the effect of ""I want to lick your pussy"". She responded with the words ""[n]o kidding"" by which she meant ""don't be silly"". When the appellant repeated his request a number of times, the complainant said ""No"". The complainant deposed that the appellant said that ""he was being nice to me and he helped me so I have to - why I can't do what he want"" (p 21), to which the complainant said she replied ""[t]his is different, it is different"". 

8The complainant then stood up and walked towards the train. The appellant followed her and, once they were on the train, stood blocking the door into the carriage compartment where the complainant's luggage had been placed. The complainant deposed that ""he said to me 'Go into the toilet because he wants to speak with me in the toilet'"" (p 25). The complainant said ""No"" and did not move. The appellant then said ""if I don't listen to him he will take my luggage out from the train and then he will take the luggage to where we meet at first"". 

9The complainant said that ""I just wanted to escape from that situation but I couldn't find anyone near me. There was no one at all looking at us or listening to us. ... And then he pulled my jumper which red and black striped jumper and then he forced me to get into the toilet"". She said that he dragged her into the toilet and she said ""something similar to no but I just can't remember exactly"". The appellant came into the toilet also, and shut and locked the door. 

10The complainant said that the appellant then committed various types of sexual assault being cunnilingus (Count 2), fellatio (Count 3) and penile/vaginal intercourse (Count 4). At one stage the complainant tried to unlock the door but said that the appellant told her not to and that, as she was scared, she stopped trying. The detention of the complainant in the toilet was the subject of Count 1 of the charges against the appellant. 

11After a period of ""about 20 to 30 minutes"" the appellant allowed the complainant to leave the toilet. The train had commenced to move whilst they were in the toilet. The complainant went to the seat for which she had a ticket and the appellant came and sat in the aisle seat next to her. The complainant said that she had commenced to cry in the toilet and was still doing so. A conductor came to check their tickets. 

12After some time the train stopped and the appellant left, saying ""I'll call you later"". Soon after this occurred the conductor came by again and on seeing the complainant crying asked her whether something was wrong. She said that there was and, in a carriage away from the other passengers, she told him that she had been raped. After arriving at the school she told a Japanese assistant teacher that she had been raped and then said the same to the School Principal, to whom she was taken by the assistant teacher. The complainant was then taken to Bathurst Hospital where she was examined by a doctor. 

13Counsel for the appellant cross-examined the complainant at considerable length. He did not suggest to the complainant that the sexual activity did not occur. Rather, he put to her that she had consented to it. 

OTHER EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL 

14Mr Powell, the train conductor to whom the complainant referred in her evidence, was called to give evidence. He recalled seeing the complainant and the appellant at the platform on Central Station and again on the train when he asked for their tickets. His observation of the complainant on the latter occasion was that ""[s]he was very quiet"" (p 149). 

15Mr Powell said that he saw the complainant and the appellant again later and noticed that the complainant was crying. He asked her if she was ""okay"". He said that ""[s]he didn't really reply anything she just kept her head down and kept on crying"" (p 151). Later again he saw the complainant sitting on her own. He deposed that: 

""I asked her if she was okay again she didn't say anything. I asked her if the gentleman was still on board with her. She shook her head. At that stage I was very worried about her. She seemed like she was - I felt like she was like scared or she had something really bothering her so I asked her to stand up and walk with me to the next carriage. I took her bags for her"" (p 152). 

16When they reached the next carriage, the complainant told Mr Powell that she had been raped. 

17Statements of the School Principal and a student at the school to which the complainant was travelling were read at the trial. Both described complaints of rape by the complainant after her arrival at the school. 

18The only other evidence of present significance was a handwritten statement of Dr Michael Thompson that was tendered. Dr Thompson examined the complainant at about 5.45 pm on 4 September 2005. His report included the following in his account of what the complainant said to him: 

""A man in Sydney (unknown to her) helped her to carry her gear to the train. The train was still stationary he said, 'I've helped you so you must help me'. She said no. He told [the complainant] he had a very powerful position in Government and that if she did not have sex with him his father would make her go back to Japan. Then he said 'no you cannot make this decision - he told her then he just wanted to talk to her ... "". 

19In addition to the sexual assaults of which the complainant gave evidence, Dr Thompson recorded that the complainant told him that the appellant had ""digitally penetrated her anus"". 

20The appellant did not call any evidence. 

THE APPELLANT'S SUBMISSIONS 

21In his Written Submissions counsel for the appellant contended that the Crown's case was ""deeply flawed"" because the complainant's evidence, upon which the Crown relied ""almost exclusively"" was ""seriously undermined"" by what he said were inconsistent versions of events given by the complainant and contradictions between her evidence and other evidence at the trial. 

22He submitted further as follows: 

""Particular heed was had to the issue of the demeanour of the witness. It is submitted that it is evident from the transcript that the [complainant] was prevaricating in answering questions, that she sought to be evasive and failed to respond to questions in an appropriate way. It is further submitted that this cannot be explained merely by reference to the fact that English was her second language, there is the evidence of at least one witness that she spoke [quite] good English and that there is nothing to suggest she required an interpreter when speaking to police or the doctor at Bathurst hospital. Further, a great deal of her evidence was given in English without the assistance of an interpreter. 

Further, the transcript evidence is supported by observations and concessions of the Crown and the trial judge. 

When one takes this weakened evidence and combines with the evidence of the actions of the [appellant] on the day - providing her with his phone number, remaining on the train until Katoomba, giving her his passport, and later telephoning her later that evening - and take into further consideration that even on the basis of the evidence of the complainant that her only response to the crudery of the accused was ""You're kidding"" or ""This is different"" and that there is no evidence of any violence or any threats of physical violence, coupled with the lack of any violence, that this is clearly a case where a reasonably jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt"". 

THE COMPLAINANT'S EVIDENCE - ALLEGED INCONSISTENCIES 

23Counsel for the appellant submitted that the inconsistencies in the complainant's version of events included both internal inconsistencies and inconsistencies between the complainant's evidence and other evidence. The primary areas in which the complainant's evidence was asserted to be inconsistent are dealt with below. 

Inconsistencies with CCTV evidence 

24Counsel for the appellant referred in his written submissions to the complainant's evidence that the appellant had followed her back to the train, and submitted that this evidence was inconsistent with the CCTV evidence of the complainant and the appellant on the platform, which ""clearly showed that [they] walked together to the train"". This was a minor point as walking with someone could well be regarded as following them, depending on the circumstances. 

25In both oral and written submissions counsel for the appellant said that the complainant gave evidence that whilst she was on the platform with the appellant there was ""nobody else around"" and that this was also inconsistent with CCTV evidence. Although requested by the Court to do so, counsel did not give a reference to the point where he alleges that the complainant gave that evidence. As best I can determine he appears to have in fact had in mind the complainant's evidence that when the appellant ""cornered"" her after they got on the train that there was ""no-one around"" (p 56). While there was CCTV evidence played to the complainant in cross-examination that depicted a number of people getting on the train at roughly the same time as the appellant and complainant, there was no CCTV evidence of the location of those passengers once inside the train to contradict the complainant's evidence that there was no-one around when the appellant ""cornered"" her. 

Whether people were around after the complainant left the toilet 

26Counsel for the appellant submitted that the complainant had given evidence that there was no-one around after she left the toilet but that other evidence indicated that not to have been the case. He said that the passenger manifest in evidence, and the evidence of Mr Powell, indicated that there were over 20 people in the carriage at the relevant time. The manifest however also indicated that there were some 68 seats in the carriage. There was not necessarily any inconsistency between that evidence and the complainant's evidence in circumstances where there was no evidence as to how the people were distributed in what was clearly a carriage of substantial size. 

27Furthermore, the complainant did not adamantly assert that there was no-one around. She was willing to concede that there were a number of people in the carriage, but said that she would not in any event have complained to them ""because [she] was too scared because [the appellant] was beside [her]"". In any event, the complainant's explanation for any inability on her part to accurately recall the number of passengers in the carriage was a reasonable one, namely that ""she was too upset and... couldn't notice any of it"". The trauma that the complainant alleges that she had just experienced was hardly conducive to accurate recollection. 

When the appellant left the train 

28Counsel for the appellant submitted that the complainant said that the appellant left the train at the ""first stop"" when objective evidence showed that he did not do so until a number of stops had passed. However some of the stops may have occurred whilst the complainant and the appellant were in the toilet. In any event any deficiency of recollection of the complainant in this regard is of no significance bearing in mind the trauma that she had allegedly experienced. 

Phone calls made by the complainant 

29Counsel for the appellant submitted that the telephone records in evidence showed that the complainant made a number of mobile phone calls after the sexual assaults had occurred and whilst the appellant was sitting next to her on the train. In contrast, the complainant's evidence was that she made the calls after the appellant got off the train. 

30The complainant gave her evidence in March 2009, that is, some three and a half years after the events in question. That lapse of time and the trauma that the complainant had allegedly experienced rendered insignificant any deficiency in the complainant's evidence in this respect. A conclusion that, contrary to her recollection, the complainant made the phone calls whilst the appellant was present would not raise any serious concerns about the veracity of the complainant's evidence as a whole because, as the Crown suggested on the appeal, the complainant may well have seen her mobile phone as a ""great ally"" in a situation where she had no choice but to remain in the company of the appellant. 

The Doctor's statement 

31Counsel for the appellant alleged that two major inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence arose out of the report of Dr Thompson. 

32The first concerned the complainant's reason for going into the toilet with the appellant. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant dragged her into the toilet (Transcript pp 25-26), that he threatened that he would take her luggage off the train (pp 25 and 74) and that the ""biggest reason"" that she went into the toilet with the appellant was that she was scared of him (p 75). As the appellant's counsel pointed out, she did not give in her evidence, as one of the reasons, the reason recorded by the doctor, which was that the appellant said that ""he had a very powerful position in government and that if she did not have sex with him his father would make her go back to Japan"". 

33The second inconsistency related to Dr Thompson's reference in his report to the appellant having ""digitally penetrated her anus"", which was an allegation that the complainant did not make to the police or in her evidence in chief. 

34These are matters of more significance than the other matters to which counsel referred. However for a number of reasons I do not consider that these discrepancies seriously undermined the complainant's evidence. 

35First, the complainant's evidence at the trial was given three and a half years after the events in question. Deficiencies in recollection after such a period are to be expected. Secondly, the appellant's point relates to what occurred in the course of an event that, on the complainant's evidence, was highly traumatic. There were at the time obviously a number of statements being made by the appellant and physical contact involving him dragging the complainant into the toilet was occurring. It is not surprising that her recollection about that incident might be deficient and might vary at different times. Thirdly, it is not a point that suggests any dishonesty in the complainant's evidence. At most it points to a deficiency in her recollection. It does not in any way affect the consistently maintained import of her evidence that the sexual intercourse occurred without her consent. Fourthly, the complainant spoke to Dr Thompson on the day of the alleged sexual assaults in the context of a criminal investigation. It is entirely possible that the complainant believed that anything she had said to the doctor (to whom she spoke prior to giving her statement to the police) would be passed on to the police. 

36As pointed out by McClellan CJ at CL in Mohamed v R [2008] NSWCCA 45 at [18]: 

""18 Merely because there are inconsistencies in the evidence of a witness it does not follow that it should be rejected either in whole or in part. There are many reasons why inconsistencies may emerge in an account of an event by a person who has been physically threatened and subject to inordinate stress at the time the events occur. See ""Who is telling the truth? Psychology, common sense and the law."" (2006) 80 ALJ 655; see also R v Tubou [2001] NSWCCA 243 at [38]"". 

37To similar effect were the following comments that McHugh J made in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487. The force of his observations are not in my view affected by the fact that his Honour dissented as to the outcome of that appeal and that the majority took a different view to McHugh J concerning the significance of the particular inconsistencies evident in that case: 

""It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness's evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital - such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue - discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness's account may make it impossible to accept that person's evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail, is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of occurrence of the witness's general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment"" (at 534). 

38In my view, whether taken individually or together, the alleged inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence and with other evidence did not cast doubt upon the veracity of her evidence that she had not consented to the sexual activity. 

CONSIDERATION OF THE APPELLANT'S OTHER SUBMISSIONS 

39Contrary to the appellant's counsel's submission, the complainant was not, on my reading of the transcript of her evidence, guilty of prevarication or evasion such as to cast serious doubt on her evidence. The jury, which heard the complainant give evidence and was thus in a better position than this Court to consider such a submission, must ultimately have reached a similar conclusion. 

40In written submissions, counsel submitted that ""[t]here is no evidence that [the complainant] expressed any dissent in relation to the earlier two acts of intercourse"" (that is, the acts that were the subject of Counts 2 and 3). In respect of Count 4, counsel submitted that ""when she said to the [appellant] to stop, he did stop"". These submissions do not in my view take proper account of the complainant's evidence in chief. In respect of Count 2, the complainant deposed that the appellant said to the complainant when they were in the toilet ""I want to lick your pussy again"", to which she responded ""No"" (Transcript p 30). In respect of Count 3, her evidence (through an interpreter) included the following: 

""Well he first grabbed my head or the knot possibly and bring - brought my head into his penis then. And he put his penis into my mouth. Well I didn't move myself so he made me move back and forwards"" (p 33). 

41In respect of Count 4, the complainant's evidence was that ""I was crying and I said nearly 'stop, stop' and like 'no' like those kind of things. I can't remember the exact words but similar to 'no' and 'stop'."" When the Crown prosecutor asked the complainant whether the appellant stopped when she used words to that effect, the complainant responded ""not at that stage"". 

42Reference should also be made to the complainant's evidence of her initial rejections of the appellant's sexual advances (see [7] above) and of the appellant's use of force to drag her into the toilet (see [9] above). 

43Contrary to the appellant's counsel's submission that the complainant did not make her lack of consent plain, the complainant's evidence (assuming it is to be accepted) clearly showed that she did. 

44The ""observations and concessions of the Crown and the trial judge"" referred to in the appellant's submissions (see [22] above) were, in effect, the decision of the trial judge to give a Prasad direction (see R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161) and the Crown's concession that such a direction was appropriate. In my view these matters are not of assistance to the appellant on this appeal. So far as this Court is concerned, its task is to make an independent assessment of the evidence. In SKA v The Queen the trial judge's opinion, expressed in his report of the trial, that the jury acting reasonably could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, was not regarded as impinging upon the Court of Criminal Appeal's task (see [115]). What occurred at the present trial fell well short of the opinion expressed by the trial judge in relation to that trial. 

45The effect of the Prasad direction was to put before the jury a number of areas of potential concern in relation to the complainant's evidence. It ensured that the jury was equipped to reach a well-informed view about the complainant's evidence. It does not assist the appellant in this appeal. If anything, it gives confidence in the jury's verdict. 

46In his submissions, counsel for the appellant referred (see [22] above) to evidence that the appellant provided his telephone number to the complainant, remained on the train for a period of time after the alleged sexual assaults, showed the complainant his passport and later telephoned her. I accept his submission that these are matters to be weighed in the balance, as I have done, in making an independent assessment of the evidence. However, these matters could not of themselves be regarded as compelling indications of the appellant's innocence. 

INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE 

47As well as considering the particular points referred to above that were raised by the appellant's counsel, I have reviewed the whole of the evidence given at the trial and considered whether the evidence established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In my view it did. It follows that my view is that it was open to the jury to find that the Crown had proved its case in respect of each of the charges beyond reasonable doubt. 

48The complainant adhered, throughout the long and testing cross-examination of her, to her evidence as to her lack of consent to sexual intercourse. The circumstances in which the intercourse occurred did not of themselves suggest the likelihood of consent. Rather, they pointed in the opposite direction. The complainant was a young girl with limited command of English, in a foreign country, and on her way to start high school in Australia. The sexual intercourse commenced in a train toilet within an hour, or perhaps considerably less, of the complainant having met the appellant. The complainant complained to the train conductor that she had been raped as soon as the appellant left the train. The conductor observed the complainant to be greatly distressed at that time. The conductor had also observed that the complainant was crying prior to the appellant leaving the train. Independent witnesses gave evidence of further complaints by the complainant upon her arrival at the school. The fact that there may have been some inconsistencies within the complainant's evidence and between her evidence and the objective evidence is not surprising and did not engender any disquiet as to the veracity of her evidence as to her lack of consent to sexual intercourse. 

ORDERS 

49As the appellant's appeal was not on a ground ""that involves a question of law alone"", he required leave to appeal ( Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5(1)). In my view that leave should be granted but, for the reasons I have given above, the appellant's appeal against his convictions should be dismissed. 

50I agree with the judgment of Johnson J in relation to the appellant's application for leave to appeal, and appeal, against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him. 

51JOHNSON J : For the reasons given by Macfarlan JA, I agree that leave to appeal against conviction ought be granted, but that the appeal should be dismissed. 

APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE 

52I turn to consider the Appellant's application for leave to appeal against sentence. 

53The facts are set out in the judgment of Macfarlan JA. 

54Following conviction by the jury, the Appellant was sentenced on 25 February 2010 to the following terms of imprisonment: 

(a) Count 1 - detain for advantage contrary to s.86(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 14 years' imprisonment) - fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months to commence on 11 June 2014 and expire on 10 June 2015; 

(b) Count 2 - sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s.61I Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty 14 years' imprisonment; standard non-parole period seven years) - non-parole period of four years commencing on 11 December 2009 and expiring on 10 December 2013, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 11 December 2013 and expiring on 10 December 2014; 

(c) Count 3 - sexual intercourse without consent under s.61I Crimes Act 1900 - non-parole period of four years commencing on 11 December 2009 and expiring on 10 December 2013, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 11 December 2013 and expiring on 10 December 2014; 

(d) Count 4 - sexual intercourse without consent under s.61I Crimes Act 1900 - non parole period of five years commencing on 11 December 2009 and expiring on 10 December 2014, with a balance of term of one year commencing on 11 December 2014 and expiring on 10 December 2015. 

55The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of five years and six months commencing on 11 December 2009 and expiring on 10 June 2015, with a balance of term of six months commencing on 11 June 2015 and expiring on 10 December 2015. 

THE APPELLANT'S SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES 

56The Appellant was 28 years' old at the time of the offences and 32 years' old at the time of sentence. 

57The Appellant's criminal history recorded low-range PCA offences in 2000 and 2001, and offences of driving whilst suspended (2000), driving whilst disqualified (2001) and driving whilst licence cancelled (2001). For the 2000 offences, he was fined and disqualified. For the 2001 offences, the Appellant was ordered to perform community service and was further disqualified from driving. 

58His Honour approached sentence on the basis that the Appellant had no relevant prior criminal history. 

59Before the District Court on sentence were a presentence report dated 10 August 2009, a psychological report dated 25 June 2009 prepared by Forensic Psychological Services with the Department of Corrective Services and a report of Rima Nasr, psychologist, dated 10 December 2009. 

60The Appellant suffers from epilepsy for which he has been treated for some years. He has no history of psychiatric disorder. 

61The Appellant left school prior to completing Year 12. After working initially in a family business, he travelled overseas and worked as an English teacher in Asia and also performed restaurant and bar work. He asserted that he had also worked in commodity training. Ms Nasr observed that the Appellant ""impressed as a superficial individual socially, whose responses often related to social image and financial subject matter"" . 

GROUNDS OF APPEAL ON SENTENCE 

62The Appellant relied upon the following grounds of appeal with respect to sentence: 

(a) Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to make a finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence in respect of Counts 2, 3 and 4; 

(b) Ground 2 - his Honour failed to give reasons for declining to set a non-parole period in respect of Count 1; 

(c) Ground 3 - his Honour erred in finding that there was an aggravating factor in terms of s.21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that the ""injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial ..."" ; 

(d) Ground 4 - his Honour erred in finding as an aggravating feature that the victim was a vulnerable person; 

(e) Ground 5 - the sentences were manifestly excessive. 

63At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant was granted leave to rely upon the following additional ground concerning sentence: 

Ground 6 - that his Honour erred in setting a measure of accumulation and concurrency such that the non-parole period exceeded 75% of the total head sentence. 

GROUND 1 - FAILURE TO MAKE FINDINGS AS TO OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF OFFENCES CARRYING STANDARD NON-PAROLE PERIODS 

64The second, third and fourth counts on the indictment each alleged an offence of having sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, contrary to s.61I Crimes Act 1900 . The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for 14 years, with a standard non-parole period of seven years. 

65The second count related to the act of penetration in the form of cunnilingus, the third count involved penetration in the form of fellatio and the fourth count, penetration by way of penile/vaginal sexual intercourse. Each of the offences was committed in the course of the sustained sexual assault by the Appellant upon the victim in the toilet of the train. 

66Following conviction, the Crown submitted on sentence in the District Court that each of the s.61I offences were at, or just below, the middle of the range of objective seriousness (AB398-399). Defence counsel in the District Court submitted that the offences did not lie in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, as there was not ""some sort of gross physical force, trauma, punching, slapping or threat with a weapon etc"" nor any ""apparent gratuitous violence or violence of any form"" (AB403-404). A little earlier, defence counsel had submitted (by reference to the victim impact statement) that, although there was emotional trauma, there was ""no physical harm as a result of violence threat, there's no bruising there's no punching bashing any of the indicia which are common in matters like this"" (AB403). 

67In passing sentence, his Honour made no finding concerning the level of objective seriousness of each of these three crimes. As the Appellant had been convicted after trial, the standard non-parole period required direct consideration and not merely as a guidepost to be used on sentence following a plea: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. 

68His Honour observed (AB53) that the offence involving penile/vaginal intercourse was ""more serious involving, as it does, a more serious and degrading violation of the body and person of the victim"" . His Honour adverted to the maximum penalties and stated correctly the standard non-parole period applicable to the second, third and fourth counts. 

69His Honour observed that the ""standard non parole period represents the non parole period for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness, and the court is required to set the standard non parole period as the non parole period in the case before it, unless it determines that there are reasons for setting a longer or shorter non parole period"" with those reasons emanating from s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (AB53). His Honour then referred to potential aggravating and mitigating factors in s.21A, before stating (AB55): 

""Weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, I consider there is sufficient reason to depart from the standard non parole period in counts 2, 3 and 4. The matter to which I have particular regard in that respect is the matter last mentioned [his Honour accepted that the Appellant had 'a disability which prevented him from being fully aware of the consequences of his actions']. The standard non parole period nevertheless remains relevant in setting a non parole period for these offences."" 

70It may be inferred from this that his Honour was placing these three offences at, or close to, the middle of the range of objective seriousness. However, there was no express finding to this effect. I am satisfied that his Honour's failure to make such an assessment constitutes an error of process: R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 at [89]; Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [49]. 

71That said, his Honour proceeded to fix a non-parole period of five years with respect to Count 4, the offence involving penile/vaginal intercourse, and entirely concurrent non-parole periods of four years with respect to Counts 2 and 3, which involved cunnilingus and fellatio respectively. 

72As Simpson J observed in R v McEvoy at [89], an omission to make a finding concerning the position of an offence on the range of objective seriousness is an error of process, and it does not necessarily follow that the sentence imposed was erroneous. Even if such an error of process has occurred, a sentence may well lie within the range of the sound exercise of sentencing discretion: Corby v R at [50]. 

73An error of process such as occurred here does not take this Court directly into the realm of resentencing the Appellant: HJWG v R [2011] NSWCCA 50 at [15]. 

74The submissions of Mr Jauncey, counsel for the Appellant, in support of this and other grounds of appeal, repeated and sought to emphasise the submissions made by defence counsel at first instance, relying upon the suggested absence of non-sexual violence. 

75In Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and RS Hulme J, I said at [37]-[38]: 

""37 A significant part of the Applicant's argument related to the absence of non-sexual violence. It is not correct that substantial non-sexual violence is required before a s.61I offence moves above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The victim was highly vulnerable given her intoxicated state and the Applicant took full advantage of it. He did not need to resort to threats or acts of violence to give effect to his criminal intent. 

38 If, of course, the Applicant had intentionally or recklessly inflicted actual bodily harm to the victim at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, or had threatened to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, he would be liable for the offence of aggravated sexual assault under s.61J Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by imprisonment for 20 years and carrying a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The type of injury required to constitute actual bodily harm lies at a low threshold: McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305 at [44]. It would be wrong, in passing sentence for a s.61I offence, to have regard to the absence of a feature which, if it were present, would constitute a different and more serious offence under s.61J Crimes Act 1900: cf R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128 at [90]."" 


76The observations in Ali v R at [38] are pertinent to this case. Further, unlike Ali v R , the present Appellant did resort to threats and the use of some degree of physical force which placed the victim in fear, and finally drew her physically into the toilet cubicle in the train. The offences contained in the second, third and fourth counts are offences of sexual violence. These were serious offences of this type, involving three different forms of penetration committed against a 17-year old girl whom the Appellant had only recently met. It is fair to observe that the Appellant had befriended the complainant, and then betrayed the friendship in a manner involving significant criminality on his part. 

77It was open to the sentencing Court to find that these offences lay at, or close to, the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. 

78The non-parole periods of four years for the second and third counts were entirely concurrent and subsumed within the concurrent non-parole period of five years on the fourth count. Bearing in mind the applicable standard non-parole period of seven years, this approach to sentence was not unfavourable to the Appellant. 

79Although the sentencing Judge's findings may not have reached the point required by law, it has not been demonstrated that the non-parole periods imposed with respect to each of these offences discloses error. 

GROUND 2 - FAILURE TO GIVE REASONS FOR DECLINING TO SET A NON-PAROLE PERIOD ON THE FIRST COUNT 

80The sentencing Judge imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months with respect to the first count, an offence of detain for advantage under s.86(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum term of 14 years' imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence. 

81With respect to this offence, his Honour said (AB53): 

""The offence of detaining with an intent to obtain an advantage is generically different and in terms of the total criminal conduct of the offender was much less serious than the other offences. I think it should attract a term of imprisonment of 12 months."" 

82His Honour imposed a fixed sentence of 12 months' imprisonment for this offence, without explaining why that course was being taken. As is apparent from the orders made, it is clear that his Honour took the view that an effective measure of six months' accumulation ought apply by reference to the first count. 

83Section 45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides considerable latitude for a sentencing Judge to decline to set a non-parole period, including (under s.45(1)(c)) ""for any other reason that the court considers sufficient"" . Section 45(2) provides that, if a Court declines to set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment, it must make a record of its reasons for doing so. However, the failure of a court to comply with the requirements of s.45(2) does not invalidate the sentence: s.45(4). 

84A recognised circumstance where a court may decline to set a non-parole period is where an offender is being sentenced for multiple offences and some accumulation is appropriate. In these circumstances, fixed terms of imprisonment may be utilised because, if a sentence containing a non-parole period and a parole period was set for each offence, the parole terms of some sentences may be subsumed in the non-parole period or fixed term of other longer sentences: R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346 at [161]. Although not stated in the remarks on sentence, it seems clear enough that this was the reason for his Honour utilising a fixed-term sentence in this case. 

85I am not persuaded that the course taken by his Honour, without expressing reasons as required by the statute, discloses error in the resulting sentence. 

GROUND 3 - SUGGESTED ERROR IN USE OF VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT 

86In the course of the sentencing proceedings, a victim impact statement was tendered by the Crown, without objection from counsel for the Appellant (AB392). The victim impact statement, written by the complainant on 13 May 2009, was in the following terms (AB119): 

""After the incident, I was suffering on depression and panic disorder and have seen a counsellor and a psychiatrist for lest [sic] of my high school life which was 2 years. 

I was cutting my wrist so many times due to the depression and I tried to suicide because I felt my life went wrong. 

I have been scared to go to the toilet on train and I still cannot go even more than 3 years has past. 

It is so hard for me now to believe any males and I still am suffering of depression and panic disorder. And also I am too scared of sexual intercourse so that I sometime have problem with my boyfriend and I am not sure if I am able to have a child. 

The incident happened to me on 2005 gave me lots of suffering and I never be able to forgive the man who gave me such a stress and scared my heart. It affected my life a lot."" 

87The sentencing Judge set out the victim impact statement in its entirety in his remarks on sentence (AB49). 

88Defence counsel in the District Court made submissions by reference to the victim impact statement, contending (as mentioned earlier at [66]) that it recorded ""some psychological issues which are natural sequelae in this type of offence"" (AB403). 

89In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge referred to s.21A(2)(g), an aggravating factor where the ""injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial"" and continued (AB54): 

""This is a reference to emotional harm etc which exceeds what is to be expected from the nature of the offence. Significant harm is anticipated in offences of this kind and that is reflected to some extent in the provisions fixing a maximum penalty and a standard non-parole period. However there is in this case evidence in the form of a Victim Impact Statement that the victim suffers severe emotional harm going well beyond what might be reasonably anticipated and which is therefore an aggravating factor."" 

90In this Court, Mr Jauncey submitted that the sentencing Judge should not have accepted uncritically the contents of the victim impact statement, given what were said to be concerns with respect to the credibility and reliability of the victim's evidence at trial. He submitted that the District Court should not have relied upon the victim impact statement without corroborative evidence concerning counselling or psychiatric treatment. 

91The victim impact statement was admitted without objection in the District Court. Further, the submissions made for the Appellant with respect to it did not include arguments of the type advanced to this Court. In particular, it was not contended that less weight ought be given to it because of the victim's evidence given at trial nor the absence of other evidence. In any event, the jury had clearly accepted the evidence of the victim, giving rise to the conviction of the Appellant on all counts. 

92In my view, it was open to the sentencing Judge to reach the conclusion which he did by reference to the victim impact statement. The contents of the victim impact statement go beyond what might be regarded as the type of harm expected from offences of this type. 

93Ground 3 ought be rejected. 

GROUND 4 - SUGGESTED ERROR IN FINDING THAT VICTIM WAS VULNERABLE 

94In the course of the remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge said (AB54): 

""It is also an aggravating factor that the victim was vulnerable and subsection [21A](2)(l) gives examples of this. In this case the fact that the victim was of a foreign nationality, linguistically and culturally disadvantaged and relatively young, justifies the conclusion in my opinion that she was vulnerable in the situation which developed, although I would not regard this as a major factor."" 

95Mr Jauncey submitted that, in the circumstances of this case, the finding of vulnerability was not open to the sentencing Judge. He pointed to the words of s.21A(2)(l) which provide for an aggravating factor of an offence if ""... the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim's occupation (such as a taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant)"" . He submitted that the complainant in this case was not ""very young"" and that there was no basis for concluding that she was vulnerable. 

96As the terms of s.21A(2)(e) make clear, the provision does not purport to be an exhaustive list of circumstances of vulnerability for the purpose of sentence: Perrin v R [2006] NSWCCA 64 at [35]. A combination of factors may operate, in a particular case, to render a victim vulnerable for the purposes of sentence. The fact that the complainant in this case was 17 years of age and not, in that sense, ""very young"" does not mean that she cannot be a vulnerable victim. 

97With respect, his Honour's analysis of the victim's vulnerability was both open and correct. She was a 17-year old girl from a foreign country who had come to Australia for the purpose of study. She was travelling alone on public transport. The Appellant, who could speak some Japanese, approached her in a manner which gave the appearance of friendship and assistance. Travelling on a public transport system in a foreign land, the adolescent victim no doubt felt somewhat at ease with the Appellant and trusted him. In this context, he sexually assaulted her. To my mind, the characterisation of the complainant as a vulnerable victim was entirely appropriate. 

98I would reject the fourth ground of appeal on sentence. 

GROUNDS 5 AND 6 - CLAIM OF MANIFEST EXCESS AND OF ERROR IN SETTING A TOTAL EFFECTIVE NON-PAROLE PERIOD THAT EXCEEDED 75% OF THE TOTAL HEAD SENTENCE 

Submissions 

99It is appropriate to consider these grounds of appeal together, although Ground 6 was only added, by leave of the Court, during the course of the hearing in light of the arguments advanced for the Appellant. 

100Mr Jauncey submitted that the sentences were manifestly excessive. With respect to Ground 6, he submitted that the sentencing Judge had fallen into error in imposing an effective sentence of mandatory imprisonment of five years and six months with a non-parole period of six months. He submitted that this did not comply with the requirements of s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

101The Crown submitted that the sentences were not manifestly excessive and that the sentences imposed, in reality, operated favourably to the Appellant in that the balance of term was shorter than that which would have been appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 

Decision 

102With respect to Ground 5, the question to be determined is whether the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. 

103These were serious offences for which the Appellant was convicted by a jury. With respect to three offences, a standard non-parole period applied. The Appellant's subjective circumstances were taken into account by the sentencing Judge. 

104In my view, no error has been demonstrated in the non-parole periods imposed with respect to the second, third and fourth counts. The non-parole periods were entirely concurrent, with a longer non-parole period for the fourth count which was characterised as being of greater objective seriousness by the sentencing Judge. 

105It was open to the sentencing Judge to partially accumulate the sentence on the first count, that being an offence involving different criminality to the other counts, although related in time and context. 

106The sentences imposed in this case are, in one sense, unusual. Section 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the Court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence, and that the balance of term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of a non-parole period for the sentence, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more. 

107It does not appear that any submission was made to the sentencing Judge that a finding of ""special circumstances"" should, or should not, be made in this case. 

108The non-parole periods for the second and third counts represented 80% of the full term for each offence. The non-parole period for the fourth count represented 83% of the full term for that offence. His Honour did not refer at all to s.44(2) and the issue of ""special circumstances"" . 

109It has been said that there is no statutory requirement to give reasons where the statutory ratio is left unvaried at 75%: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 721 [86]. 

110However, this Court has said that a sentencing Judge's silence as to the reason for increasing the proportion of the non-parole period relative to the full term above 75% may create an impression that the Judge has overlooked giving appropriate focus to the statutory ratio: Briggs v R [2010] NSWCCA 250. If the non-parole period exceeds the statutory relationship, some reasons should be provided to avoid an inference that there has been an error or oversight: Russell v R [2010] NSWCCA 248 at [41]. 

111Indeed, in Briggs v R , this Court intervened when the Judge who sentenced the present Appellant approached sentence in the same way as in this case. Fullerton J (Hodgson JA and Price J agreeing) said at [34]: 

""However, and despite the clarity of his Honour's sentencing remarks and his express finding that the non-parole period should be 8 years, his silence as to the reason for increasing the proportion of the minimum period in custody relative to the total term above 75 per cent leaves me with a sense of disquiet that he may have overlooked giving appropriate focus to the statutory ratio provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the result, I am persuaded that error is demonstrated in this limited respect and that an adjustment to the non-parole period should be permitted."" 

I observe that his Honour sentenced the present Appellant on 25 February 2010, well before the judgment in Briggs v R was handed down on 5 November 2010. 

112Section 44 does not mandate a relationship between an overall non-parole period and the remainder of the overall sentence: Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [11]. Nevertheless, once a measure of six months' accumulation was applied on the first count, the effective non-parole period was one of five years and six months with a balance of term of six months. The aggregate non-parole period is approximately 92% of the aggregate total sentence. 

113Like the Court in Briggs v R at [34], I am left with a sense of disquiet that the sentencing Judge seems to have overlooked giving appropriate focus to s.44(2) in this case. I am persuaded that error is demonstrated in this limited respect, and that some adjustment to the effective non-parole period should be made. An effective reduction of six months ought be made. 

114There ought be a total effective non-parole period of five years with a balance of term of one year. This will see the aggregate non-parole period being 83% of the aggregate total sentence. I am satisfied that a total effective non-parole period of no less than five years is appropriate. This represents the minimum period which the Appellant ought spend in custody, having regard to all the elements of punishment including rehabilitation, specific and general deterrence, the objective seriousness of the offences and the Appellant's subjective circumstances: R v Simpson at 717 [59]. At the same time, provision for a 12-month parole period will allow a more realistic period of conditional liberty in the event that the Appellant is released to parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period. 

115I would uphold the sixth ground to the extent of reducing the total effective non-parole period by six months. This can be achieved by adjusting the commencement date of the fixed term of 12 months' imprisonment on the first count to 11 December 2013, to expire on 10 December 2014. 

116It has not been demonstrated that the sentences imposed upon the Appellant were manifestly excessive. I would reject the fifth ground of appeal. 

CONCLUSION 

117I propose the following orders: 

(a) grant leave to appeal with respect to sentence; 

(b) the sentence on the first count, being a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months, is varied to commence on 11 December 2013 and to expire on 10 December 2014; 

(c) the earliest date upon which the Appellant will be eligible for release on parole is 11 December 2014. 

118GARLING J : I agree with Macfarlan JA and Johnson J.

		15 July 2011",2011-07-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757408,The Application of Robert Minniti [2011] NSWSC 835,"JUDGMENT  1The applicant, Robert Minniti, was convicted by a jury on 2 December 2004 on a charge of attempting to possess not less than a commercial quantity of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) that had been imported into Australia on 4 October 2003.  2The applicant was sentenced on 17 March 2005 by the trial judge, Dodd DCJ, to a non parole period of eight (8) years, with a head sentence of twelve (12) years.  3The applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence.  That appeal was dismissed on 20 February 2006 : Robert Minniti v R [2006] NSWCCA 30.  Whilst I was a member of that Bench and joined in the orders that were made, the present application relies upon a ground that was not argued for the purposes of the appeal.  4The applicant seeks an order under s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act) referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  The basis for the application arises out of the contents of a number of affidavits, which collectively assert that the trial judge and some members of the jury were asleep at various times during the trial.  It is submitted that this evidence suggests that there was a significant departure from the proper conduct of the trial, in that the trial judge's supervision of the trial and the jury's attention to the evidence were inadequate.  5The Court can only refer the case ""if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"" : s 79(2) of the Act.  The inquiry is not a judicial act, but an administrative function : Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) (2003) 214 CLR 318 at 362 [124].  6It is necessary to briefly refer to the Crown case at trial and the nature of the issues that were joined between the parties.  7On 4 October 2003 a large piece of farm equipment was imported into Sydney from Belgium.  A very large quantity of tablets were secreted within the machinery.  On examination by Customs the tablets were found to contain 3-4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine also known as MDMA or ecstasy.  8On 9 October 2003, a Dutch national named Rutten entered Australia to supervise the distribution of the tablets.  Later that month, two Belgian nationals came to Australia, removed the tablets from the machinery and provided them to the Rutten.  9Rutten took the tablets to a city apartment. Rutten and the Belgian nationals were arrested on 1 November 2003 by Federal police agents.  On the same day, a Mr Vermes borrowed a white VW transporter with Victorian registration plates.  10Police substituted the ecstasy tablets in one of the containers with a large quantity of an inert substance.  The police also took the Toyota vehicle which had been used by Rutten in Sydney and parked it in Goulburn Street at the intersection of George Street.  The bag containing the inert substance was placed inside the vehicle.  11Rutten agreed to assist the police.  He made a phone call to a man whose number had been provided to him by his European contact.  On 2 November 2003 Rutten travelled to the corner of George and Goulburn Streets in possession of a covert recording device.  Federal police kept Rutten under surveillance.  12Later that afternoon, Rutten met Vermes at a cafe at that location.  Rutten recognized Vermes' voice from a telephone conversation the previous night.  After some conversation they left the cafe together and headed towards the Toyota parked in Goulburn Street.  They were joined en route by the applicant.  13At the vehicle, Rutten took out the bag the police had placed there and all three men retraced their steps back to the corner of George Street and Goulburn Street.  Along the way, the applicant took over possession of the bag from Rutten.  The applicant then left Rutten and Vermes at the intersection and took the bag from that location to Rawson Place, further south of George Street near Central Railway.  On the way the applicant met up again with Vermes and another man who was standing in the street.  All three kept walking south.  The applicant left Vermes and the other man at the intersection of George Street and Rawson Place and proceeded along Rawson Place towards Pitt St.  14The Victorian VW was parked in Rawson Place.  The applicant took the bag to an alcove near the vehicle and was then told to stop by a Federal police agent.  The applicant left the bag and ran along Rawson Place away from George Street.  He was apprehended by a number of Federal police agents.  The bag was recovered and the applicant was found to have the keys to the VW vehicle in his pocket.  15Following retrieval of the recording device from Rutten later that day, a conversation between Vermes, Rutten and the applicant contained references by the applicant to walking back to the car with the bag ""like normal fucking ... normal tourists.""  16The applicant's case at trial was that he knew nothing about the contents of the bag.  Upon his arrest, he exercised his right to silence.  It was suggested to a number of police witnesses in the course of the trial that the applicant had not run from the police.  The applicant's senior counsel submitted to the jury that at least one police witness had fabricated his account of the chase in that regard.  The applicant did not give evidence and did not call any witnesses.  17Proof of the applicant's knowledge of the contents of the bag was circumstantial.  The Crown relied upon the fact that the applicant and Vermes were at the relevant location together to meet Rutten, that the applicant took a very heavy bag, walked towards Central, was in possession of the keys to the vehicle, ran from police when they identified themselves and that the conversation recorded prior to his arrest was consistent with a plan to collect drugs whilst appearing to be tourists.  18The jury obviously drew the conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that there was no reasonable explanation on all of the evidence other than that the applicant was aware that the bag contained an illicit drug.  Antecedent to that conclusion, it was necessary for the jury to find as a fact that the applicant ran from the police and that his ""flight"" evidenced a consciousness of guilt.  In addition, the jury must have accepted the reliability of the tape recording and that the applicant's words disclosed a concerted effort to appear unobtrusive.  19The applicant has been represented throughout his trial, the Court of Criminal Appeal proceedings and in the lodgement of this application by the same solicitor.  This factor assumes some significance for the purposes of determining whether the contents of the affidavits give rise to a sense of disquiet or unease in allowing the conviction to stand.  20As the affidavit evidence demonstrates, the applicant and members of his family complained to senior counsel at trial that the trial judge appeared to be sleeping for periods of time of up to 20 minutes.  Up to three jurors were also observed to ""nod off"" during the trial.  It is said that the applicant's legal representatives told the applicant that there was no legal redress available to him.  21About one month after the applicant was sentenced, the applicant's solicitor received an email from one of the applicant's supporters at the trial.  In that email, which is annexed to the solicitor's affidavit of 24 June 2010, the author confirmed that the judge and a juror were asleep during the trial and that the applicant's family were of the opinion that the applicant did not get a fair trial.  22The solicitor responded by email on 2 May 2005, in part in the following terms :- ""once we are in a position to prepare the grounds of appeal, I have no doubt that [counsel] will be keen to take every point and if he feels there is any mileage to be made out of the judge's attentiveness during the trial then by all means it will be made.  Further I believe the shadow that this matter has cast over all the trials the judge has conducted will be something we can use in the appeal.""  23Nine months elapsed between this email exchange and the hearing of the appeal.  Different senior counsel appeared for the applicant on the hearing of the appeal.  The applicant maintains that he and members of his family again raised this issue with counsel before the hearing of the appeal, but were told that it was not a viable ground of appeal.  The applicant's solicitor confirms that he received the same advice from counsel.  24Six months after the applicant's trial, the applicant made a complaint to the Judicial Commission, consistent with the evidence that is now produced, to the extent that it was asserted that the trial judge slept from time to time.  That complaint was not ultimately the subject of a hearing in the Conduct Division because of the retirement of the judge in late July 2005.  25Following the High Court's decision in Cesan v The Queen ; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen [2008] HCA 52 on 6 November 2008, the applicant and members of his family provided the affidavits (in December 2008) that are the basis of this application.  All of those affidavits annex statutory declarations that were originally prepared in January 2007.  The affidavit of the applicant's solicitor however was not prepared until June 2010 in response to the Crown's submissions on the application.  26I turn to the affidavits.  27The applicant's affidavit indicates that the applicant saw the trial judge ""sleeping on many occasions throughout my entire trial proceedings.  At times it was blatantly obvious that he was sleeping as his head fell forward and his reading glasses slid down towards the end of his nose and we could hear him snore.""  28An affidavit sworn by Josie Minniti indicates that she witnessed the trial judge ""fall asleep several times during the court case"" and that the trial judge ""would occasionally sit back in his chair, close his eyes and what appeared to be snoring.""  29The affidavit of Giuseppe Minniti indicates that throughout the applicant's trial he saw the trial judge ""close his eyes and what appeared to be him falling asleep.""  Mr Minniti also saw one member of the jury fall asleep, in that ""she closed her eyes and appeared to have lost interest in the case and fell asleep"".  30Teresa Minniti refers in her affidavit to the trial judge ""closing his eyes, and appeared to be falling asleep on numerous occasions"" and that this occurred ""when important evidence was being given.""  31Ms Christine Minniti says that she saw the trial judge ""fall asleep throughout the trial"".  32The applicant's partner, Kim Powell, says in her affidavit that she saw the trial judge ""sleep for short and long periods of time"".  Ms Powell recalls one occasion when the trial judge slept throughout the whole of senior counsel's closing address which lasted, according to her estimate, for two hours.  Ms Powell also saw three jurors ""nodding off"".  33Ms Angela Perrone says in her affidavit that she saw the trial judge falling asleep, in that ""when he nodded off his glasses would slide to the end of his nose and his head would recline forward.  At times he would nod off for short periods of five to 10 minutes and other times 20 minute intervals.  I once even heard him snore.""  Ms Perrone also refers to one of the jury habitually falling asleep.  34Mr Anthony Ozzimo says in his affidavit that he saw the trial judge ""falling asleep every day for up to 20 minutes at a time.""  He also saw ""various jury members having naps and not paying attention during the trial.""  35The applicant's mother says in her affidavit that she saw the trial judge asleep ""on numerous occasions"".  She remembers certain characteristics, including ""when he fell asleep he had a pen in his hand that would fall when he'd sleep.  Glasses he was wearing would slide down his nose when his head would lower, he would awaken and fix them to their proper position.  He would also rest his head in the palm of his hand and when he fell into a deep sleep his head would fall down.  [The judge] would also bang his hands on the bench from awakening.""  Mrs Minniti said that she saw a number of jurors asleep.  36The applicant's father says in his affidavit that he saw the trial judge ""lean back in his chair with his head resting on the back of the seat sleeping.""  37Antonella Ozzimo, the applicant's sister, says in her affidavit that she saw the trial judge ""on various occasions falling asleep at the bench.""  She also saw ""various members of the jury falling asleep during the trial.""  38Gino Perrone says in his affidavit that the trial judge was ""sleeping or nodding off on many occasions.""  He indicates that the judge would fall asleep for five or 10 minutes ""and snore loudly"".  Mr Perrone also describes the trial judge adjusting ""his glasses towards the bottom of his nose as a decoy for his eyes closing and entering in a sleeping pattern.""  39The affidavit of Gregory Goold, the applicant's solicitor during the trial, confirms that various members of the applicant's family were present during the trial and that, from time to time, members of the applicant's family approached him during breaks in the proceedings and at the end of the day's proceedings, in order to bring to his attention their observations of the trial judge's behaviour.  Mr Goold responded on one occasion ""well I saw him with his eyes closed but don't know whether he was sleeping or not.""  Mr Goold goes on to say that he brought these matters to the attention of the applicant's senior counsel.  Mr Goold says that he remembers ""from time to time looking at the judge and noticing that he had his eyes closed and was leaning back in his chair.  For a majority of the time however my gaze was either directed at witnesses giving evidence or I was taking notes of the proceedings.""  Mr Goold raised the matter with senior counsel at the end of the trial in response to further complaints from members of the applicant's family and from the applicant himself.  According to Mr Goold, senior counsel ""indicated that he was unsure what could be done about this situation.""  40Mr Goold's affidavit also confirms that the applicant's supporters were seated throughout the trial behind a glass wall separating the public gallery from the courtroom.  Mr Goold maintains that he also sat there on occasions during the trial and that his hearing was not impeded by the glass wall.  41In summary, the evidence that emerges from the affidavits is:-  All of the deponents were present throughout the eight days of the trial in the public gallery, which was separated from the courtroom by a glass wall.  The trial judge was observed to close his eyes, drop his head and snore on several occasions during the trial, indicating that he had fallen asleep.  These periods of sleep were variously estimated at 5 to 10 minutes, up to 20 minutes, and on one occasion (during the applicant's counsel's closing address) for up to 2 hours.  The trial judge appeared to sleep for some period of time every day of the trial.  At least one, and as many as three, jurors appeared to ""nod off"" or sleep for some indeterminate periods of time during the trial (although the evidence is silent as to whether more than one juror was asleep at the same time on any given occasion).  42The Commonwealth Crown's instructing solicitor, Crown Prosecutor and the Australian Federal Police informant during the trial have no recollection of the trial judge sleeping on any occasion, although that may well be due to the passage of time since December 2004.  More importantly, the Crown notes that the Judicial Commission records indicate that the judge commenced treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea in September 2004, that is, between the trial of Cesan ; Mas Rivadavia in June 2004 and the applicant's trial.  Some improvement in the judge's condition might be reasonably expected to have occurred by the start of the applicant's trial on 23 November 2004.  43The tenor of the evidence in support of the application is consistent with the observations made of the same trial judge by witnesses in this Court in the appeal of Cesan v Director of Public Prosecutions and Mas Rivadavia v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCCA 273.  Given the reliance placed by the applicant upon the High Court's decision overturning the majority decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, a closer analysis of the reasons supporting the High Court's decision is warranted.  44French CJ in Cesan at [72] noted that :-  The appearance of a court not attending to the evidence and arguments of the parties and control of the conduct of the proceedings is an appearance which would ordinarily suggest to a fair and reasonable observer that the judicial process is not being followed. That is not to say that every minor distraction, inattention, sign of fatigue or even momentary sleepiness constitutes a failure of the judicial function. The courts are human institutions operated by human beings and there must be a margin of appreciation for human limitations. Otherwise the judicial system would be rendered unworkable by the imposition of unachievable standards. Nevertheless, it would be an unnecessarily narrow view of the judicial duty to say that appeal courts are to judge such lapses solely by reference to their effects upon the outcome of the case. In so saying, it must be accepted that the question will ordinarily fall for consideration in the application of statutory language, in this case the common form provision for criminal appeals reflected in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act .  45Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that the Court may set aside the verdict of a jury if it is of the opinion that there has been a miscarriage of justice.  Notwithstanding the success of the appellant's case, the Court may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred (the proviso).  46Later in the course of French CJ's judgment in Cesan , ""miscarriage of justice"" was examined having regard to other High Court decisions, notably, TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 212 CLR 124 and Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614, where the defect in the trials was one of trial process rather than error in directions.  47Ultimately, the Chief Justice formulated the approach to be taken in cases where a miscarriage of justice is said to arise from a failure of the judicial function in these terms (at [93]) :-  If, by reason of sleep episodes or serious inattention, the reality or the appearance exists that a trial judge has substantially failed to discharge his or her duty of supervision and control of the trial process in a trial by jury, then enough has been made out to establish a miscarriage of justice. The question whether there has been the reality or appearance of a substantial failure by the judge to perform his or her duty will require assessment of a number of factors including:  1. Whether the conduct of the judge can be said to have affected the outcome of the trial.  2. Whether the conduct of the judge has created a risk that the outcome of the trial may have been affected.  3. Whether counsel raised the question of the trial judge's conduct at the trial.  4. Whether the jury appeared to have noticed or to have been distracted or otherwise affected by the judge's conduct.  None of these factors, taken by itself, is determinative. There is an overall assessment to be made in deciding whether a failure or apparent failure by the judge for whatever reason to attend to the duty of supervising and controlling the trial process amounts to a miscarriage of justice. In so saying it should be emphasised that the duty of counsel in a case of non-trivial inattention or sleep episodes is to draw these issues to the attention of the judge in the absence of the jury. The failure of counsel to do so may support an inference that the judge's conduct did not amount to a substantial failure in the judicial process at trial. However, it will not always be determinative.  48The outcome of this approach in Cesan was that a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the trial judge's substantial failure to maintain the necessary supervision and control of the trial and because the jury was distracted by his conduct, particularly during the accuseds' evidence.  The substantial failure of the judicial process was established by the evidence before the Court of Criminal Appeal, which included the fact that the trial judge was asleep on a number of occasions on the 11 days when evidence was being given, that he slept at least once on most of those days and on some days on two or three occasions, that some of the sleep episodes lasted from 10 to 15 minutes while most lasted between two and 10 minutes, and that the judge's sleeping was accompanied by heavy breathing on a number of occasions and snoring during the accused's evidence.  Furthermore, ""it could not be said in this case that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice [given that] the judge's conduct had a discernible distracting effect on the jury."" (at [97])  49Gummow J also found that there was a miscarriage of justice constituted by the fact that ""the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence and that the very source of the distraction was the sleeping judge.""  (at [105])  His Honour agreed with Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ with respect to the application of the proviso.  50Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ noted at [112] that ""the occasion for the departure from the proper conduct of the trial was the trial judge falling asleep. ...  But for present purposes, attention should focus upon the consequences of the trial judge falling asleep.""  (referring to TKWJ and Nudd ).   Their Honours placed particular emphasis upon the evidence in the Court of Criminal Appeal which demonstrated that ""during the cross-examination of one of the two accused on trial, at least some members of the jury were not paying attention to the evidence being given."" (at [116])  51Later their Honours said at [120] - [121] :-  Ensuring that the jury is not distracted from paying full attention to its task is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge.  If trial counsel is concerned that members of the jury cannot give, or are not giving, proper attention during the trial it will be for counsel to raise that issue with the trial judge.  Ordinarily, if the trial judge does not act of his or her own motion, and if trial counsel says nothing, an appellate court will not later be able to conclude that the jury did not pay attention to the evidence that was led.  In particular, proffering the opinion of one or more observers about whether the jury appeared to be paying attention to proceedings would not ordinarily suffice to show that there has been a miscarriage of justice.  The absence of intervention by the trial judge will usually far outweigh the value of any opinion offered by some observer after the trial is over.  In the present cases, however, the evidence that was accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeal went beyond the bald assertion of observers that the jury seemed not to have paid attention during the trial.  The evidence that was led in the Court of Criminal Appeal showed that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence and was distracted because the trial judge was asleep.  52With respect to the application of the proviso, their Honours said :-  127. In these cases the miscarriage lies in the distraction of members of the jury from their task.  And because that is the miscarriage of justice that occurred in these cases, it is not possible to conclude, on the written record of the trial, that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt. ...........  129. In many cases where the proviso is to be considered, the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict will indicate rejection of any explanation proffered by the accused in evidence.  In the present cases, however, the relevant hypothesis is that the jury did not pay attention to all the evidence led at trial.  In particular, the jury was distracted when one of the two accused persons was giving his evidence. In those circumstances, it is not possible, in these cases, to place any weight upon the fact that the jury returned its verdicts of guilty.  130. Each accused proffered an explanation of what was put against him. ...   But whether the evidence as a whole, including what each accused said in explanation, was sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt was a question for the jury to decide having regard to more than the words that are recorded in the transcript of the proceedings.  But because members of the jury were distracted, they did not perform this task.  53Heydon J agreed with Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.  54It is appropriate to observe at this point that the question whether the circumstances relied upon by the applicant give rise to the relevant sense of unease or disquiet is of a different character to the question whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  The test under s 79 of the Act is less demanding than that under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act : Application of Pedrana [2000] NSWSC 970.  However, the matters taken into account by the High Court in Cesan have a bearing on this application.  55The claims advanced in support of the application suggest that there has been the reality or appearance of a substantial failure by the judge to perform his duty.  However, an examination of the trial transcript produces a rather different impression.  56The transcript demonstrates relevant and regular interventions by the trial judge on every day of the trial during the evidence of every witness.  The frequency of these interventions can best be gauged by noting that there are 45 of them, eleven of them occurring on sequential pages, five of them at intervals of three pages, five of them at intervals of five pages, and the remainder at intervals of two, four, six, eight, nine and twelve pages.  The longest period of no intervention is represented by 28 pages of transcript.  The trial judge's comments include the repetition of a witness' answer to a question that is misinterpreted or misheard by counsel, queries as to the relevance of a question, directing a witness' or the jury's attention to an exhibit that is the subject of a question and rejection of repetitive questions.  57The trial transcript also reveals some exchanges between the judge and counsel which suggest that one specific claim made about the judge's conduct is grossly exaggerated, namely, the assertion by one deponent that the judge slept through the whole of senior counsel's closing address.  58The last witness in the Crown case commenced his evidence at 10:40 am on 30 November 2004.  The Crown commenced its closing address immediately after the cross examination of that witness and continued until the luncheon adjournment.  There was no morning tea adjournment.  59Following the luncheon adjournment the trial judge said :-  Members of the jury, I owe you an apology for having kept you there this morning for so long.  I'm sorry about that.  I should have thought about that earlier, so please accept my apology, and if at any stage this afternoon any of you are feeling uncomfortable for any reason in the jury box, just give me a bit of a wave and let me know. I was looking at all of you from time to time, of course, this morning.  I didn't see any signs of discomfort, otherwise I would have taken a break, but please let me know if there is anything like that this afternoon or at any time, for that matter. It sometimes happens for various reasons, I know.  60The Crown Prosecutor then continued his closing address for a further short period of time, which, judging from the four pages of transcript, may not have lasted more than about 10 minutes.  The applicant's senior counsel commenced his closing address immediately thereafter.  The address continued uninterrupted until the following exchange :-  HH : Mr Ramage, I notice it is four o'clock.  Are you going to be some further time?  Counsel : I am not going to finish in the next minute, your Honour.  HH : All right.  Can I interrupt you there ... and can we finish it for the day?  Counsel :  Yes.  61The trial judge then allowed the jury to separate.  The following discussion took place between the trial judge and senior counsel in the absence of the jury :-  HH : Mr Ramage, I have let you go on because I don't like to interrupt counsel, but I am going to have to tell the jury that all of this stuff about the surveillance observations and the police officers' notes or not taking notes and the way in which they made their statements, and all that kind of stuff is, in view of the way the issues now stand, completely irrelevant.  62Senior counsel responded to that statement.  The judge further queried the relevance of those aspects of his closing address, against the background of the content of the Crown address.  The applicant's senior counsel submitted that the Crown Prosecutor had not confined himself in his address to six circumstances in order to establish the Crown case.  His Honour then said :-  That's what he did in the end, whatever it is he said along the way. You have conceded at the outset of your address that your client took the bag and took it down George Street, whether it was a long way, a short way, that's what he did.  [And further]  At this stage of the case I'm going to tell the jury to concentrate on what the real issues are. .....   I didn't interrupt your address while you were doing it, and I said that right at the start.  If you are going to continue with it tomorrow, well, that's up to you.  But I thought I should let you know now that that's what I will be saying to the jury.  63The applicant's senior counsel made further comments in relation to certain irrelevant portions of the Crown's closing address.  The trial judge agreed to some extent, saying :-  I will say appropriate things to the jury about both addresses, but you spent a lot of time on the evidence quoting particular bits of the evidence of particular police officers , and I thought I should say that to you at this stage, because that's my view, unless you can persuade me that it is in some way relevant to the issues that the jury has to decide.  64The proceedings then adjourned to 1 December 2004.  65The next day there was some preliminary discussion between the bench and counsel on the subject of directions relating to flight.  The applicant's senior counsel resumed his closing address, which was transcribed over 11 pages, until the morning tea adjournment.  Following the morning tea adjournment the closing address continued until the luncheon adjournment.  66After the luncheon adjournment, but in the absence of the jury, the judge said :-  Just while the jury is coming, Mr Ramage, there was one thing, I know you didn't say it deliberately, but I thought I heard you say in respect of Ms Owens something like ""who claims to have heard"" - and this is not quoting you exactly - ""what the accused yelled out"".  Counsel : I thought I withdrew that.  It said she heard but couldn't make out the words.  I quoted exactly.  HH : No, no, but later on in another context, I think you said that, when you were talking about her not hearing Galic calling out to the accused, ""police stop"".  Counsel : Yes, I did say that.  Am I wrong?  HH : I don't think she claims to have heard what the accused yelled out.  Counsel : No, no, I accept that.  I read out those passages.  HH : Yes, but subsequently, when you were talking about what Galic said he called out to the accused -  Counsel : Yes  HH : - you said that Owens hadn't heard it, and you referred to her as someone who claimed to have heard what the accused had yelled out to Vermes and -  Counsel : I meant that she claimed to have been present.  .....................................................................  HH : That is not what she said, as I understand it.  She said she didn't hear what they said.  67There was further discussion on the accuracy of senior counsel's representation of the evidence.  68Senior counsel's address then continued for a further 16 typed pages of the transcript.  The trial judge commenced the summing up immediately thereafter, which continued over 18 typed pages of transcript.  After sending the jury home, a further exchange occurred between the trial judge and the applicant's senior counsel.  That exchange contained the following :-  HH : Mr Ramage, there is only one other thing I wanted to raise with you that I think I ought to tell the jury. You said in your address when referring to the recorded conversation which is exhibit C, and the Crown's submission in relation to what occurs at line 34, that Rutten wasn't asked if he understood the conversation in the way suggested by the Crown, but, of course, if the Crown had asked that question of him, then whether you had objected or not, I wouldn't have allowed it.  69The trial was then adjourned to 2 December 2004.  70The judge's summing up continued the next day, concluding at the morning tea adjournment.  During that adjournment, the applicant's counsel raised some aspects of the summing up which he considered required correction or supplementation.  Relevantly, during that discussion, the judge received a note from the jury requesting written directions on possession and circumstantial evidence.  71After morning tea, the jury was given final oral directions and some written directions on flight.  The jury retired on verdict at 12:18 pm.  Written directions on possession and circumstantial evidence were supplied to the jury a short time later.  72The nature and content of the exchanges set out above, particularly the italicised passages, are completely inconsistent with the proposition that the judge slept through the entirety of the applicant's counsel's closing address.  On the contrary, the judge demonstrates by his comments that he has paid close attention to it and that he has been mindful of the jury during this part of the proceedings.  73The judge's invitation to the jury to signal the need for a break during the closing addresses is also inconsistent with a failure to supervise the trial process.  74Having regard to the objective evidence relating to the conduct of the trial, I am not persuaded that there was either the reality or the appearance of a substantial failure by the trial judge to perform his duty.  I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that very experienced senior counsel and a specialist criminal instructing solicitor were not moved to put anything on the record at trial, or to pursue an avenue of appeal that had been plainly raised by the applicant.  The refusal to do so was apparently supported by another senior counsel of the Victorian bar.  The inference that is available from these circumstances is that these practitioners considered that, to the extent that the judge appeared to sleep for short periods of time during the trial, those periods of inattention did not constitute a substantial failure of the judicial process.  75Accepting for the purposes of the application that there may have been occasions when the judge appeared to sleep, or did ""nod off"" for short periods of time, there is no sound basis for concluding that the jury was distracted or otherwise affected by the judge's conduct, in the sense explained by the High Court in Cesan .  None of the material suggests that the jury failed to perform their task of paying attention to the evidence in the trial because they were distracted by the judge's behaviour.  It is said that some members of the jury appeared to ""nod off"" or ""nap"" or sleep from time to time, but episodes of fatigue and momentary inattention in the course of a trial among members of a jury are within ""the margin of appreciation for human limitations"".  There has not been shown to be any compelling connection between the judge's conduct and the behaviour of certain members of the jury, such as was demonstrated in Cesan .  76It is instructive that Mr Goold's affidavit contains no reference to members of the jury falling asleep and that the complaints made to him by members of the applicant's family during the trial did not include observations about the impact of the judge's conduct on any member of the jury.  Nor does Mr Goold refer to any episodes of audible snoring by the trial judge, notwithstanding that he was seated at the bar table for the majority of the trial and was therefore in much closer proximity to the bench than any member of the applicant's family.  The applicant himself does not refer to any episodes of sleep on the part of the jury.  77Finally, once again accepting for the purposes of the application that the judge appeared to sleep or did sleep for relatively short periods of time, that conduct cannot be said to have affected the outcome of the trial, or created a risk that the outcome of the trial may have been affected.  The issue for the jury was a very narrow one.  The applicant made formal admissions under s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 on the second day of the trial as to the whole of the Crown case up to the events of 2 November 2003.  The jury's attention was confined to the evidence from which they were asked to draw the inference as to knowledge on the part of the applicant of the contents of the bag.  The jury received written directions on flight, the concept of possession and the nature of a circumstantial case.  In the absence of any evidence from the applicant that contributed to the pool of evidence from which the jury could draw the critical inference, the jury's task was relatively straightforward.  78Taking all of these matters into account, I have no sense of disquiet or unease in allowing the conviction to stand.  In my view, there is no doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt.  The application is refused.  **********

		04 August 2011",2011-07-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757415,O'Connor v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 161,"Judgment  1BEAZLEY JA :  On 8 September 2009, the applicant pleaded guilty before Keleman DCJ to the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to Henrietta Kahui on 4 August 2098 contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s 35(2).  An offence under that section carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years and a standard non-parole period of 4 years.  As the applicant pleaded guilty, the standard non-parole period does not apply to the sentencing process.  However, it remains as a reference point for the sentencing judge in determining what sentence to impose: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131.  2His Honour sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months expiring on 12 June 2011, being the first day upon which the applicant was eligible to be released.  His Honour imposed a total term of imprisonment of 4 years commencing on 13 December 2008.  In imposing this sentence, the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 10 per cent on the sentence that otherwise would have been appropriate, having regard to the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, which was entered on the day the offender was due to stand trial:  see R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  See also the Criminal (Sentencing Procedure) Act , 1999, s 22.  3The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the ground that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.  The applicant has already served his non-parole period and has been released on parole.  On the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, the applicant, who appeared in person, informed the Court that he seeks a reduction in the balance of the term that was imposed by the sentencing judge.  In effect, the applicant seeks a reduction of the period of 18 months on which he is on parole.  As he put the matter to the Court, "" 18 months is a long time "".  Circumstances of the offence  4The applicant was sentenced on the basis of the following agreed facts.  On 4 August 2008, Ms Henrietta Kahui was performing traffic control duties at Lurnea, where roadworks were underway.  At about 11.45 am, the applicant was riding his bicycle along West Street, Lurnea.  As he approached the intersection where the roadworks were being undertaken, Ms Kahui said to the applicant, "" You can't ride across here, the tar is still hot "".  5Notwithstanding this warning, the applicant continued to ride his bicycle across the intersection.  As he road past Ms Kahui, she said, "" You idiot you shouldn't ride on hot tar "".  In response to this rebuke, the applicant got off his bicycle, threw it to the ground, walked quickly towards Ms Kahui and said, "" I can ride wherever I fuckin want "".  Ms Kahui commenced to say something back to him, when the applicant punched on the right cheek with a closed fist, causing her immediate pain.  Ms Kahui put her hands up, trying to defend herself, but the applicant punched her a second time with his closed fist, this time with his hitting her on the mouth, causing her to fall to the ground.  6As a result of the fall, Ms Kahui sustained a fibula fracture and a tibial plafond fracture in her right lower leg.  She required hospitalisation and underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures.  Ms Kahui also sustained facial injuries caused by the punches to her face.  7Fellow workers of Ms Kahui chased and caught the applicant.  A violent struggle ensued, but the fellow workers were able to subdue the applicant and detained him until the police arrived.  The applicant sustained a number of facial injuries during the course of this struggle.  8The applicant, when arrested, admitted that he had assaulted Ms Kahui.  However, he said:  ""Yeah I did it, but I didn't know it was a girl, look at me I got mine back, she shouldn't have mouthed off at me.""  9The applicant received medical treatment for his facial injuries and also required other treatment which is referred to below.  Sentencing principles  10The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence upon an offender are now identified in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 3A as follows:  "" 3A Purposes of sentencing  The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:  (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,  (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,  (c) to protect the community from the offender,  (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,  (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,  (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,  (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""  11In this case, the sentencing judge identified the offence as "" objectively serious "" and considered that for offences of this type, general deterrence and punishment were of particular importance.  His Honour also considered that having regard to the applicant's prior criminal history, to which I shall refer shortly, personal deterrence was of considerable importance.  The applicant's personal background  12The applicant's background and personal circumstances reveal dysfunctional family relationships, drug and alcohol abuse, and a long criminal history commencing as a juvenile at about age 15 and extending to his last conviction, being only two months prior to the assault the subject of the present application.  13The applicant has been convicted of various break enter and steal offences, various driving offences, drug and alcohol offences, malicious damage offences, wilful and unlawful destruction of property offences and, most significantly for the purposes of the present matter, a number of prior assault offences, three of which were assaults occasioning actual bodily harm.  14As a result of this long history of criminal activity, the applicant has been placed on bonds, fined, committed to juvenile institutions, sentenced to periods of community service and to periodic detention, had suspended sentences imposed and has been sentenced to imprisonment on two separate occasions for non parole periods of 6 months.  15The offence immediately prior to the present offence for which he was sentenced on 6 June 2008 at Liverpool Local Court involved a common assault, damage to property and possession of a prohibited drug.  In respect to the first two of those offences, the applicant was subject to two s 12 bonds for a period of 8 months, which still had 6 months to run at the time of this offence.  Two and a half months earlier, that is, on 19 March 2008, the applicant had been sentenced at Liverpool Local Court on drug charges and placed on a s 9 bond for 18 months, which likewise was current at the time of this offence.  16In a pre-sentence report dated 2 November 2009 tendered at the sentence hearing, it was reported that the applicant had recently made attempts to change his life by maintaining his own rental property and spending time with positive peer influences.  The author of the pre-sentence report considered that the applicant was making a concerted effort to change his lifestyle.  He was also in reasonably steady employment, working three to five days a week as a builder's labourer.  He gave evidence before the sentencing judge that his former employer was prepared to have him back at work following his release.  His Honour was prepared to accept that evidence.  17His Honour also accepted the applicant's evidence that about 2 to 3 months prior to the sentencing hearing he had been diagnosed with a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and had been prescribed antidepressants and was also on antipsychotic medication.  The applicant gave evidence that the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was said to have been caused by numerous attempts on the applicant's life which occurred in around June 2008.  His Honour accepted that his condition explained the applicant's level of anxiety at the time of the offence.  18His Honour also appears to have accepted that the applicant had moderated his alcohol intake but that he continued to be an occasional user of cannabis.  The applicant at that time had not undertaken any programmes to address his drug and alcohol problem.  19In his evidence on the sentencing hearing, the applicant gave two explanations for his offending behaviour on this occasion.  First, he contended that Ms Kahui called him a "" retard "".  He said he reacted badly to this because his younger brother, with whom he maintained a good relationship, suffered from Down syndrome.  His Honour did not accept this evidence, but did accept, that as set out in the statement of agreed facts, that Ms Kahui had called the applicant an "" idiot "".  20The second explanation that the applicant proffered for his conduct was that he did not know that Ms Kahui was a woman.  He thought that the person who had told him to stop was a man.  His Honour, correctly, rejected that explanation as in any way diminishing the objective seriousness of the offence.  His Honour also doubted, having regard to photographic evidence in the case, whether the applicant could have made such a mistake.  Approach of the sentencing judge to sentence  21In sentencing an offender, the court is required to take into account relevant aggravating factors enumerated in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 21A and relevant mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3).  22So far as aggravating factors were relevant, the sentencing judge had regard to the applicant's record of previous convictions:  see s 21A(2)(d);  and the fact that the offence was committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty in relation to other offences:  see s 21A(2)(j).  In taking into account the applicant's lengthy criminal history, his Honour described the offences of violence of "" a minor nature "".  His Honour did not explain why he described those offences in that way, given that there were three convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a sentence of 6 months imprisonment had been imposed on the applicant in respect of one of those offences.  Given that a term of imprisonment was imposed in respect of one of these offences, I consider that this finding was one of a number of findings that were favourable to the applicant.  23Although the sentencing judge did not expressly identify the mitigating factors that he took into account it is apparent from his remarks that he took into account that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity:  s 21A(3)(b);  and that the applicant entered a plea of guilty:  see s 21A(3)(k) and s 22.  24It is also possible the provisions of s 21A(3)(c), that the offender was provoked by the victim, were relevant in this case, in the sense that Ms Kahui called the applicant an "" idiot "" and it appears that the applicant reacted to that comment.  Having said that, the circumstances in which that remark was made were such that if there was any provocation it was of such a minimal nature as to be of no particular relevance.  Indeed, in my opinion, his Honour could have considered, as an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(l), that Ms Kahui was in a vulnerable position.  Although she did not fall into the examples specified in s 21A(2)(l), she was employed to control traffic in respect of public roadworks being carried out by a private contractor.  She was vulnerable in the sense that she was required to give traffic commands on a public roadway.  However, as his Honour did not expressly take that factor into account, it is appropriate for the purposes of considering his Honour's sentencing exercise to put that to one side.  25His Honour had regard to the applicant's personal circumstances, including his dysfunctional childhood, his drug and alcohol problems, his attempts at personal rehabilitation in the period prior to this offence and the recent diagnosis of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  26His Honour also took into account that the applicant suffered extra-curial punishment, in that he sustained injuries in the scuffle that ensued when he was chased by Ms Kahui's fellow workers.  In this regard, his Honour again made favourable findings to the applicant, accepting that in addition to receiving black eyes and swollen lips, he received more serious injuries, requiring admission to hospital on two occasions in the week or two after the offence, because he was passing blood and bleeding from his anus.  Although there was no medical evidence to support that those injuries had occurred in the scuffle, his Honour accepted that that was the cause.  27Balanced against those favourable personal matters, his Honour considered that the applicant did not have a clear insight into his wrongdoing because, whilst having pleaded guilty, he sought to shift blame onto the victim, saying that she should not have "" told him off "".  This was an attitude that the applicant had maintained from the time he was arrested, through to the Probation and Parole officer who interviewed him for the purposes of the pre-sentence report and in his evidence in court.  28His Honour accepted that the applicant suffers from a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and that the disorder was an underlying factor in the commission of the present offence.  However, notwithstanding that the applicant suffered from anxiety due to that condition, his Honour was satisfied that the applicant committed the offence with full knowledge of what he was doing and with full knowledge of the gravity of his actions.  29His Honour found that the offence fell into the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences.  That finding was made with the principle stated in Way in mind, namely, that the standard non-parole period for an offence, whilst not applicable where an offender pleads guilty, is nonetheless relevant as a reference point in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  30His Honour also made a finding of special circumstances and imposed a non parole period which was 62 per cent of the total sentence.  31Having regard to all of those factors, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment, imposing a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months and a balance of term of 18 months, that is, a total sentence of 4 years.  Was the additional term imposed manifestly excessive?  32The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive and in all circumstances another sentence was warranted in law:  see the Criminal Appeal Act , s 6(3).  33In his written submissions, the applicant drew the Court's attention to the fact that the nominal starting point prior to the taking account of a 10 per cent discount for the plea must have been 4 years 4 months and that that was simply too high.  As I have already indicated, in his oral submissions he confirmed this in slightly different terms, namely, that 18 months was "" a long time"".  34In my opinion, there is no basis for accepting that contention.  His Honour found that the offence was in the mid-range of objective seriousness.  Given the circumstances in which it occurred and the severity of the attack, there is no warrant to interfere with that finding.  Once that is accepted, it is apparent that the sentence imposed by his Honour was within an appropriate sentencing discretion.  As has been stated above, the standard non-parole period for this offence is 4 years.  His Honour, correctly recognising that the standard non-parole period was only relevant as a reference point in the sentencing of a person who pleaded guilty, imposed a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months, 25 per cent lower than the standard non-parole period.  35Given that the serious aggravating circumstances of the offence, most particularly the fact that the applicant has a long criminal history, including for the same offence, and that he committed this offence whilst on conditional liberty, including for the same offence, I am of the opinion that no other sentence was warranted in law.  In reaching this conclusion, I have also taken into account that in imposing the non-parole period, his Honour made a finding of special circumstances.  Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.  36I wish, however, to add the following.  In his oral submissions, the applicant was polite and addressed the Court in a coherent, appropriate and helpful way.  He informed the Court that he has moved location so as to take himself away from the influences that had apparently led him into trouble in the past.  To the extent that the Court was able to gauge, he appeared genuinely hopeful of turning his life around.  One of the purposes of a period of probation is to assist a person to do exactly that.  The applicant is to be encouraged to treat the remaining 17 months of his probation as a source of support, not as something negative hanging around his neck, to assist him to maintain his present optimism, so that the way ahead for him will be positive and crime-free.  37The orders I propose are:  1. Leave to appeal be granted;  2. Appeal dismissed.  38HALL J :  I agree with Beazley JA.  39HARRISON J : I agree with Beazley JA and particularly wish to associate myself with her Honour's additional remarks at [36].  **********

2757417,R v WILLIAMS [2011] NSWDC 118,"SENTENCE 




1HIS HONOUR: Elliott Thomas Williams appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of aggravated break enter and steal. The circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown is that Mr Williams was in company at the time of the offence. I have spoken on other occasions about the way that the objective gravity of an offence of this kind is determined insofar as it carries with it a standard non parole period. I can therefore very briefly say that circumstance of aggravation relied on by the Crown (in company) and the actual indictable offence committed after breaking and entering (stealing) are both towards the bottom of the range of their respective criteria. For that reason many offences of break enter and stealing in company would be at a fairly low level of objective gravity. But not this case. 

2The offender, as I will describe, committed this offence in such a way as to cause significant consequences for the victims of it. Mr Williams is 21 years of age. He lives with his mother. His parents separated when he was three. His father left and he remained with his mother and his half brother. His half brother James suffered from cerebral palsy requiring a great deal of care. This involved his mother in almost full time care of James. When the offender turned 14 he too began caring for James. The offender would talk to James and even though James could not communicate, the offender established a good relationship with him. Then James passed away. 

3The offender commenced to move away from the path that he was on. He is a clever boy who had demonstrated an ability to achieve academically and to maintain employment. But he moved out of home and stopped associating with other worthwhile young men and instead began associating with others who had a superficially attractive lifestyle involving alcohol and nightclubs. 

4Sometimes it is said to me that a person moved in with the wrong crowd and I sometimes sceptically wonder whether in fact the person was not the wrong crowd himself. But in this case it does seem to be the case that the offender was influenced by others rather than the offender doing the influencing. And so it came about that the offender then committed a series of offences which I will now describe. 

5As I mentioned earlier the offender has pleaded guilty to one offence of break enter and steal but there are a number of matters on a Form 1 which he asks that I take into account when I sentence him. One of those is also a break enter and steal committed on 2 June 2010. The offender and his co-offender broke into some premises by smashing a window and once inside they ransacked a number of rooms before stealing a number of items including it must be clearly noted, items of clear sentimental value. 

6One of the other things taken was a credit card so the offender in company with another person used that credit card to buy more than $1,000 worth of clothing. That is an offence of dishonestly obtain property by deception which also appears on the Form 1. 

7Some of the property that the offender had taken from the premises he then pawned at a pawn brokers, leading to offences of goods in personal custody suspected of being stolen and furnishing false information to a pawn broker. They are further offences appearing on the Form 1. 

8That brings us to 18 June 2010 where the offender committed the substantive sentence for which he must be punished. Once more this was an offence of break enter and steal in company. The offender broke in during the day accompanied by another man. The offenders had removed a fly screen and got in through a window. When the householders returned home that evening it was discovered that the offence had been committed. Contents of wardrobes had been removed and were strewn on the bed and the floor. Drawers were open in an office, with the contents having been strewn on the floor as well. The offender had gone into children's bedrooms taking gaming consoles, games, televisions, DVD's and the like. 

9Once more the offender took a large number of items of jewellery of clear sentimental value. He pawned some of those which led to another matter on the Form 1. He was detected by police after being stopped in a vehicle that was registered to him. When police searched that vehicle they discovered a number of items that had been stolen in the break enter and steal offences. A search of his bedroom revealed a number of DVD's. That was the final offence on the Form 1, another offence of goods in custody. 

10I suspect that even now the offender does not realise the seriousness of his conduct. Although he used expressions such as remorse when he was giving evidence in the witness box it may well be the case that the offender does not truly appreciate the harm that his offences have caused. The harm that break enter and steal offences like this lead to is found in various aspects of the crime. There is the obvious financial loss to the householders. There is the sometimes more important loss of sentimental items. Whilst it is possible to replace a television for example it is impossible to replace items of a sentimental nature which often have little monetary value. 

11The householders also understandably feel anxious and less safe in their homes. Householders generally have responded to offences of this kind by putting bars on windows, and by installing burglar alarms with the result that many householders feel that they are living in fortresses. And finally the community as a whole suffers through insurance premiums being increased to cover offences such as these. The offender certainly did not think about these at the time he committed these offences, and as I said, I doubt that he really appreciates what he has done even today. 

12He pleaded guilty at an early stage and so the sentence I impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. The fact that there are Form 1 matters of course indicates the greater need to impose a sentence on the offender which will personally deter him than would be the case in the absence of the Form 1 matters. 

13After committing these offences the offender has returned to live with his mother and once again began associating with friends who are supportive of him and demonstrate good behaviour, behaviour that the offender should emulate. He is working as much as the weather and the building trade allows him to and he has wishes to go to university as a mature age student. It is entirely possible that this series of serious offences will be an isolated deviation from a law abiding path that the offender will tread in the future. On the other hand it is entirely possible that this is also the start of the offender's criminal career. It is important therefore that I impose a sentence upon him which will bring home to him at a very early stage in his life what is likely to happen to him if he commits further offences in the future. 

14Mr Pridis concedes that a custodial sentence is required. He at first submitted that, assuming that the length of the sentence I have chosen would allow me to, I should deal with this by way of a suspended sentence. But this would mean no punishment at all. In fact I suspect it would do the offender no favours. There would be a real risk that he would get the idea that a young man can commit offences of this seriousness and get away with it even after being detected by police. It is in his interests that he be punished so that he might now understand what will happen to him if he offends again. 

15Mr Pridis's fall back position was that I would deal with this matter by way of an intensive corrections order. The Crown did not speak in opposition to that as an appropriate way of disposing of this matter. I also consider it is an appropriate sentence. As I explained to Mr Pridis it of course does carry the risk that the offender will be found to unsuitable for an ICO or perhaps even that there will be no place available for him. So there is no guarantee that the offender will not ultimately serve a sentence of full time custody. Much will depend on the results of the assessment which is to come. 

16The offender is convicted. I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is required. I am satisfied that that period of imprisonment will be less than two years. I refer the offender for assessment as to his suitability for an intensive correction order as a means of serving his sentence.

		31 August 2011",2011-07-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757418,R v Ali ALKAN [2011] NSWDC 107,"Judgment 



1. The Director of Public Prosecution charges Ali Alkan that he bashed and robbed a man named Penjman Joneidi on 10 May 2010. The evidence which forms the basis for that charge comes substantially from four sources. One is a triple-0 call made by Mr Joneidi the day after the alleged assault. The second is an account given by Mr Joneidi to police who responded to that triple-0 call some hours later. The third is a statement made by Mr Joneidi to the police made some four days later on 14 May 2010. The fourth is a statement made some months later on 4 November 2010 by Mr Joneidi - after he had been present at a process of identification - to the effect that Ali Alkan was the perpetrator of the bashing. 

2. Normally of course the prosecution would call Penjman Joneidi as its principal witness and expect that Mr Joneidi would give an account of what he claimed happened which would be consistent with the four sources which I have referred to. But in this case Mr Joneidi has died. He died earlier this year at some stage during the first half of January. 

3. The Director of Public Prosecutions nevertheless pursues the prosecution of Ali Alkan by tendering the four sources of information from Penjman Joneidi, each of which contains certain assertions. The tender is made under the Evidence Act 1995, specifically s 65(2). 

4. Mr E Balodis, counsel who appears as Crown Prosecutor, argues that each of those pieces of information is admissible under one or other provision of s 65(2) of the Evidence Act . Mr M Pickin of counsel who appears for Mr Alkan objects to the tender arguing that none of them is admissible under s 65(2). 

5. I admitted into evidence on the voir dire the four sources of information as well as some other material. It is common ground that Mr Joneidi is not available to give evidence because he is dead. That means that s 65 is engaged because of subs (1). 

6. The relevant parts of s 65 which Mr Balodis relies upon are these - ""s 65(2): 
"" The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation: 

... 

(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or 

(c) was made in circumstances that made it highly probable that the representation is reliable ."" 

7. Mr Balodis argues that the triple-0 call and the assertions made by Mr Joneidi to the police, both of which occurred the day after he claimed he was assaulted by Mr Alkan, are admissible under s 65(2)(b) and that the later two statements are admissible under cl (c). 

8. I have been assisted by both counsel significantly in references to the various authorities which discuss this provision of the Evidence Act . 

9. I should make some preliminary observations about the statutory provisions. I begin with s 65(2)(b). As Mr Studdert J said in Harris v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 454 at 461 ([32]), the provision "" imposes time restraints on the admissibility of evidence. Those restraints are expressed alternatively. The representation under consideration is to be made when the asserted fact occurred, or it is to be made 'shortly after' that occurred ."" 

10. In addition, in order to be admissible under cl (b), the representation is to be made ""in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication "". I am satisfied that fabrication essentially means made up or concocted. 

11. There is a contrast between cl (b) and cl (c), in that in order to be admissible under cl (c) the representation must have been made in circumstances "" that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable "". There is, argues Mr Balodis, an important distinction between cl (b) and cl (c). A focus of cl (b) is fabrication. The focus of cl (c) is reliability. That becomes important for the development of his argument. 

12. There has been admitted into evidence material that indicates the following. It is likely that Mr Joneidi was a drug addict. Mr Joneidi's death is likely to have been brought about by an overdose. A police officer and Mr Joneidi's GP are both of that opinion. Mr Joneidi had been treated for depression, and indeed had been prescribed medication for that depression. 

13. Some months after these claimed events Mr Joneidi made an unrelated allegation about being assaulted on another occasion in his home. There is evidence that two accused were charged in respect of that claim. However the evidence includes that the charges were "" ultimately withdrawn due to the unreliability of the deceased who kept changing his version of events "". 

14. The evidence admitted on the voir dire also indicates that Mr Joneidi asserted that he was assaulted by Mr Alkan around about 10 or 10.30 at night on 10 May 2010. He said that Mr Alkan came to his unit to borrow some money. Mr Joneidi said he did not have enough money to lend him. At that stage he said Mr Alkan picked up a dumbbell and dropped it on his foot and then started to punch him. He tried to cover his head. He started bleeding. He described himself as "" very dazed and confused "". He did not remember how Mr Alkan left, "" but I remember the front door closing "". Mr Joneidi went on to say that he "" lost consciousness after that and didn't wake up until about 11am the next day "". 

15. It was the next day, 11 May 2010, that he made the triple-0 call. That was not made until after 4.30pm on that day so, as Mr Pickin points out, there is a delay of some eighteen hours between the claimed assault by his client and the report to police emergency. 

16. Police came to visit him later on that evening of the 11th, which was about twenty-four hours or more after the time of the claimed assault. 

17. As I said, four days after the claimed assault he made his formal statement to the police and later that year he purported to select Mr Alkan's photograph from an array as representing the person who had assaulted him. 

18. Mr Pickin argues that in considering the admissibility under s 65(2) I need to take into account evidence about the fact that Mr Joneidi was a drug user and had mental health problems. I need to take into account his own version that he was confused and dazed after the claimed assault. I need to take into account that the delay is largely unexplained. Mr Joneidi said that he was unconscious for a significant amount of time overnight which Mr Pickin argues is for a greater period of time than one would expect from the extent of the injuries. In addition there is a further delay between the time he claims to have regained consciousness and when he made the phone call. There is also the evidence about his later complaint being regarded as unreliable so far as the police were concerned. 

19. Evidence about Mr Joneidi's phone usage and Mr Alkan's phone usage, has been produced by the police. Mr Joneidi does not acknowledge calls which had been made the day before the claimed events, nor does there appear amongst the records a call that one might expect to find there. 

20. There are inconsistencies within accounts, for example the triple-0 call refers to "" he "" and to "" they "", and there are inconsistencies between earlier accounts and later accounts. 

21. Mr Pickin reminds me of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia's description of s 65(2)(c) as containing "" onerous requirements "", which appears at [55] of the decision of that court in Regina v Williams (2000) 119 A Crim R 49 at 504. 

22. Mr Balodis, as I said, highlights the distinction between fabrication and reliability. He argues that the earlier statements are unlikely to be fabricated because the assertions made in the phone call and to the police are consistent with observations made by the police when they arrived. 

23. There is evidence that Mr Joneidi did not appear to be drug or alcohol affected when the police saw him on the night of 11 May. There is evidence of his attendance at hospital after he saw the police on 11 May and a consistent account of being assaulted. There are also observations of injuries which are consistent with his account. 

24. Mr Balodis emphasises the difference between cl (b) and (c), one focussing on fabrication and the other focussing on reliability. He argues that the earlier statements were made shortly after the facts which they assert. The accounts were made in what has been described in various authorities, including Harris v The Queen , as under the "" proximate pressure "" of the events which they describe. He argues that the evidence about depression should not derogate from his reliability, nor suggest fabrication. 

25. I have seen the evidence of the photographic array and I conclude that Mr Joneidi did not appear to be drug or alcohol affected. The only issue was a heavy accent. Mr Joneidi was not born in Australia. 

26. I regard the difference between the emphasis of the two provisions as important. First I should say however that I am satisfied that the descriptions given to the police emergency number, and to the police when they called, were made "" shortly after "" the asserted facts occurred. As the authorities have indicated the section obviously distinguishes between a contemporaneous account, which would be covered by the word "" when"", and a later account covered by the expression "" shortly after "". As one of the authorities said, the expression is not "" immediately after "" but "" shortly after "". 

27. The accounts given by Mr Joneidi in the triple-0 call and to the police were both made in his unit and, as Mr Balodis points out, in circumstances where he was surrounded by the results of what he claimed to have occurred. 

28. I think it is unlikely that the representations made in the circumstances were a fabrication by Mr Joneidi. That is unlikely, in my opinion, because of the consistency between his accounts and the observations made by the police, as well as the consistency between his account and the hospital record. I regard the small inconsistencies in the triple-0 account concerning he or they as minor. 

29. I am not looking, so far as that provision is concerned, at whether or not the account is reliable, but at whether it is unlikely to be a fabrication in the circumstances. I take into account the matters that I have just referred to, but also the absence of any motive which appears in the evidence for Mr Joneidi to fabricate the account which he gave. 

30. In addition there was evidence that a cap was in his unit, which DNA testing indicated has DNA consistent with Mr Alkan's. There is evidence that he had been there on another occasion, but to my mind it supports the unlikelihood of Mr Joneidi fabricating his account. 

31. However the account given by Mr Joneidi some days later on 14 May 2010 is a different matter. As Mr Balodis fairly points out, that is not caught by cl (b) and he must rely upon cl (c) of s 65(2). He needs to convince me that that statement was made in circumstances "" that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable "". 

32. This is where evidence of the reliability referred to by Mr Pickin is significant. The statement, although consistent with earlier statements, suffers from being made after a lengthy period of unconsciousness, and some days after the event, by a person who appears to be a drug addict, and with some mental health issues and who was admittedly confused and dazed. 

33. I would not regard that statement as being made in circumstances that make it highly probable, given the emphasis which the Full Court of the Federal Court places on the onerous requirements of that provision. 

34. Finally there is the statement made by Mr Joneidi selecting Mr Alkan's photograph from the array. Here it is important, Mr Balodis says, to identify the asserted fact. There is evidence that Mr Joneidi and Mr Alkan knew one another beforehand. Mr Balodis argued that what happened in the photograph array was that Mr Joneidi recognised Mr Alkan. That does appear to be consistent with what I saw when I viewed the videotape of the photographic array. Mr Balodis argues that it was not a process of identification but of recognition. The asserted fact was a representation about Mr Joneidi's current memory when he purported to recognise the photograph of Mr Alkan. 

35. Mr Balodis drew my attention to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Gee [2000] NSWCCA 198 and the distinction made at [10], in Grove J's judgment, between identification and recognition. I accept that argument. 

36. The asserted fact, I find, was the representation by Mr Joneidi that the photograph he saw coincided at the time that he saw it with his memory of the person he already knew. In other words he recognised it. It was, as Mr Balodis described it, a compelling act of recognition and should be distinguished from Mr Joneidi's assertions of what had happened on the night. I accept that argument. 

37. For the reasons which I have just given, I am of the opinion that the hearsay rule does not apply to the evidence contained in Exhibit VDA, tabs 6 and 7, of the telephone calls made on 11 May 2010 by Mr Joneidi to police emergency. Nor does the hearsay rule apply to the statement made by Mr Joneidi to the police dated 4 November 2010, which is also contained in exhibit VDA at tab 5. 

38. I am of the opinion that the hearsay rule does apply to the statement made by Mr Joneidi dated 14 May 2010, which is the subject of tab 4 in VDA, and I would reject its tender unless it is pressed on some other basis. 

39. I would admit the tender of the other three documents, including the audio recording and the video recording, unless there is some other objection.

2757419,REGINA v MANKARYOUS; REGINA v MANKARYOUS [2011] NSWCCA 158,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP, P: I agree with Hall J. 

2HIDDEN J: I agree with Hall J. 

3HALL J: The Crown appeals against the sentences imposed by the District Court upon the two respondents on 10 February 2011. The Notice of Appeal was filed by the Crown on 9 March 2011, within the prescribed time. 

4The Crown appeal is brought pursuant to the provisions of s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of the claimed leniency of the sentences. 

5The respondents were jointly charged on the indictment. They are brothers and both pleaded guilty to the two offences in question, namely, an offence of robbery in company and, at the time of such robbery, wounding the victim (s.98 of the Crimes Act 1900) and an offence of robbery in company when armed with a dangerous weapon (s.97(2) of the Crimes Act ). 

6The guilty pleas came after the jury had been empanelled. Indeed, it was the third time the matter had been set down for trial. Twice before there had been aborted trials. 

7Particulars of the offences and prescribed maximum penalties are as follows:- 

""Count 1: On 8 February 2009, robbery in company with wounding of Rachael Deering of her purse and mobile phone: 

Section 98, Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty 25 years' imprisonment; prescribed statutory non-parole period: 7 years 

Count 2: On 8 February 2008, robbery in company when armed with a dangerous weapon of Todd Hinton of his money, wallet and mobile phone: 

Section 97(2), Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty 25 years' imprisonment; no prescribed statutory non-parole period."" 

8On each count, the sentencing judge imposed entirely concurrent sentences:- 

""Michael Mankaryous: Imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 5 months dating from 9 March 2009. 

Medhat Mankaryous: Imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 5 months dating from 8 February 2011."" 

9In the Notice of Appeal, the Crown relied upon a single ground, namely, that the sentence imposed in respect of both respondents was manifestly inadequate. 

10On 9 June 2011, in relation to the respondent Michael Mankaryous, the Crown filed Amended Grounds of Appeal in the following terms:- 

""1. It was not open to his Honour to make a positive finding that there were no continuing injuries to Rachael Deering. 

2. His Honour erred in his classification of Count 1 as being substantially below mid-range. 

3. The degree of departure from the applicable standard non-parole period is so great that it manifests error. 

4. His Honour erred in his approach to the respondent's criminal history. 

5. It was not open to his Honour to find the respondent had 'turned over a new leaf' and was unlikely to re-offend. 

6. His Honour failed to assess the seriousness of Count 2. 

7. His Honour erred in making the sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2 entirely concurrent. 

8. His Honour was in error in finding special circumstances. 

9. The sentences, both individually and when combined, were manifestly inadequate."" 

11On the last-mentioned date, in relation to the respondent Medhat Mankaryous, the Crown also filed Amended Grounds of Appeal in the following terms:- 

""1. It was not open to his Honour to make a positive finding that there were no continuing injuries to Rachael Deering. 

2. His Honour erred in his classification of Count 1 as being substantially below mid-range. 

3. The degree of departure from the applicable standard non-parole period is so great that it manifests error. 

4. His Honour erred in firstly determining manifestly inadequate sentences in respect of Michael Mankaryous and then fixing sentences for Medhat Mankaryous as a proportion of them. 

5. His Honour erred in reducing the statutory ratio specified in s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without a finding of 'special circumstances'. 

6. His Honour failed to assess the seriousness of Count 2. 

7. His Honour erred in making the sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2 entirely concurrent. 

8. His Honour gave too much weight to subjective features. 

9. The sentences, both individually and when combined, were manifestly inadequate."" 

12At the hearing of the appeal on 28 June 2011, leave was granted to the Crown to amend the Notices of Appeal in the terms set out in the two preceding paragraphs. 

13On the sentencing hearing in the District Court, a Statement of Agreement Facts dated 16 November 2010 was tendered. 

14The Crown summarised the facts and circumstances referred to in the Statement of Agreed Facts on which the sentencing judge proceeded in its written submissions. I reproduce paragraphs 6 to 10 of the Crown's written submissions:- 

""6. In his remarks on sentence the Judge did not recite the facts of the offences but incorporated by reference the agreed statement of facts which had been tendered in the sentencing proceedings. They can be briefly summarised. The respondents are brothers and shall be referred to by their first names without intending any disrespect. The victims and they knew each other [sic] . Rachael Deering had recently fallen out with Medhat's sister-in-law. Rachael Deering had two items of her clothes. Sometime after late January 2009 but before the offences, Medhat telephoned Rachael Deering threatening that if she did not return the clothes and hand over money 'we'll get it one way or the other'. 

7. At about midday on Sunday 8 February 2009 the respondent went to the unit where both victims lived. Medhat was armed with a 'black pistol'. After knocking on the front door and as it started to open the door was kicked in and both respondents entered. 

8. Michael pushed Todd Hinton to the ground. He received grazing to the back and side. Medhat put the pistol to his face. 

9. Rachael Deering was punched to the face by Michael. As she fell to the ground she hit her head on a TV cabinet. Medhat then kicked her to the head. As a result she suffered a 4 cm gaping laceration to the left side of her head and multiple lacerations to her face. Her two upper front teeth were broken horizontally near the gum line. 

10. A demand for the property was made. The respondents ultimately took clothing belonging to Medhat's sister-in-law, as well as items belonging to Ms Deering (a purse and a mobile telephone). They threatened to later shoot the victims if the police were called and stated they would be back to collect $5,000."" 

15In relation to the respondent, Michael Mankaryous, the Crown set out the following matters:- 

""11. Michael was aged 20 years 4 months at the time of the offences and 22 years 4 months at the time of sentencing (DOB 15 August 1988). 

12. At the time of the offences he was on bonds imposed only a little over a month before for destroy or damage property and possessing prohibited drug. He had a record that commenced in the Children's Court in 2004, with an offence of demanding property in company with menaces with intent to steal. There was a conviction (2007) for assaulting a police officer in the execution of duty. 

13. There was a pre-sentence report. He left school after completing Year 10 and thereafter held casual jobs with periods of unemployment. He was unemployed at the time of the offences. He had been in custody since his arrest on 9 March 2009 (a month after the offences) and during that time had fathered a child. The relationship with his partner broke down in December 2010 when he made offensive remarks to her in a telephone conversation. The respondent gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings during which he agreed in response to a question from his counsel that he planned to 'make amends and to resume your relationship with your de factor (sic) wife' (T 7.42 on 4.2.11). 

14. The respondent has past drug and alcohol problems. He gave evidence that past drug and alcohol counselling had been of no benefit to him (T 9.16ff). The pre-sentence report noted that he had been generally non-compliant with reporting directions and failed to attend programs during the supervision of his past bonds. Despite this he gave evidence he wanted 'to do a drug and alcohol course', an anger management course and 'get my life on track' (T 10.12). 

15. Apart from his criminal history referred to above the respondent had a number of offences against prison discipline since being taken into custody in March 2009. These included 2 offences of intimidation (May 2009 and October 2010), 1 offence of assault (May 2009) and 2 offences of disobeying a direction (January 2011 and February 2011)."" 

16In relation to the respondent, Medhat Mankaryous, the Crown submissions set out the following factual matters:- 

""16. Medhat was aged 26 years at the time of the offence and 28 years 4 months when sentenced (DOB 10 August 1982). 

17. Relevantly he had a prior conviction for common assault but that was in 2001 for which he received a bond. 

18. Medhat did not give evidence. There was a pre-sentence report. He was married with two children. He had been consistently employed as a plumber since leaving school and had been running his own business in partnership for a year prior to sentence. There were a number of testimonials stating that he had been a trustworthy and reliable worker as well as educational and trade certificates. There was a testimonial from his mother-in-law that the offences were out of character for him and one from the parish priest of the Coptic Orthodox Church describing both he and his brother as 'genuinely good people ... hijacked by deep anger'. There was a [sic] one sentence letter form Advantage Psychology dated 25 January 2011 confirming that the respondent had attended 'a session today' - a little over a week prior to sentencing and over a year since the offences."" 

17Evidence was given from Dr Theocharous and by the parents of the respondents. The evidence established that the parents suffer from a variety of medical problems. The respondents' father had a series of medical conditions including diabetes, heart disease and gangrene to both feet. However, the point made by the Crown was that it was not suggested on behalf of either respondent that this unfortunate situation would make more difficult their time in custody. 

18Following the sentencing judge's reference to the parents' medical problems, his Honour went on to state:- 

""These proceedings have been a real struggle for the parents and, of course, the parents have become innocent victims in this matter."" 

19The Crown relied upon the proposition that it is only in the most exceptional case that a sentencing Court would mitigate sentence because of the impact of an offender's imprisonment upon family members: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510. The Crown's point was that, if this had been relied upon by the sentencing judge, then he was in error. 

Intervention by this Court 

20By way of overview, I will briefly state, before turning to the specific grounds of appeal, the basis upon which I have concluded that this Court should intervene and the approach proposed in respect of the re-sentencing of the respondents. 

21A consideration of the facts and circumstances concerning the offence by each respondent under s.98 of the Crimes Act leads to the conclusion that the finding by the sentencing judge that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below the mid-range of seriousness for such an offence was an erroneous determination. 

22I have, accordingly, concluded that the sentences imposed upon each respondent in respect of the offences under s.97 and s.98 in terms of the head sentence for each offence must be set aside. 

23However, for reasons later set out, I have concluded that, whilst the sentences imposed in respect of the offences of each respondent produced non-parole periods which were inadequate having regard to the seriousness of those offences, this Court should not disturb those non-parole periods. The imposition of the higher head sentences which I propose will result in sentences that reflect the gravity of the respondents' offending and provide for extended parole periods. 

Grounds of Appeal 

(1) Michael Mankaryous 

Summary of the Crown's contentions 

24On the hearing of the application, it was the Crown's submission that the sentences imposed in respect of both Counts 1 and 2 were manifestly inadequate. In this respect, the Crown contended that the sentencing judge, firstly, failed to make a proper assessment of the seriousness of the offence embodied in Count 1 and, secondly, that his Honour failed to consider at all the seriousness of the offence the subject of Count 2. 

25As indicated above, an offence under s.98 of the Crimes Act attracts a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment and has a prescribed standard non-parole period of 7 years. In light of the guilty pleas entered by the respondents, the standard non-parole period operates as an important reference point or guide to the sentence to be imposed: R v Davies [2004] NSWCCA 319; Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282. 

26The Amended Grounds of Appeal raised discrete issues. In effect, they constitute matters by way of complaint or criticism that are essentially directed to a contention that the sentences pronounced in respect of the two offences were manifestly inadequate. However, as they have been pleaded as separate grounds, I will seek to identify below the particular facts and matters that are subjacent to each of those grounds. 

Ground 1: It was not open to his Honour to make a positive finding that there were no continuing injuries to Rachael Deering 

27The essential point raised in the Crown's submissions was that there was no evidence affirmatively establishing that there were no continuing effects from the injuries sustained by Ms Deering. It was said that the most that could be said on the evidence was that there was no evidence either way that the injuries were continuing. 

28In the circumstances in which there was no evidence that established ongoing sequelae from the injuries, I do not consider that this ground in itself carries any significance in relation to matters that are material to Grounds 2 and 3 which are discussed below. 

29In relation to Ground 1, Ms A Francis, of counsel who appeared in this Court on behalf of the respondents, submitted that the sensible interpretation in relation to the finding as to no continuing injuries was that his Honour was simply conveying the notion of a recovery by Ms Deering. The particular wounds and injuries sustained, in other words, were not of a kind that produced ongoing sequelae. So understood, the finding was open on the evidence. 

30The provisions of s.98 of the Crimes Act , Ms Francis observed, cover a very wide range of offending including very serious offending and that the permanence of injuries is a relevant circumstance where serious wounding or grievous bodily harm has been inflicted. The absence of permanent effects of injury, on the other hand, was a relevant factor in determining objective seriousness in terms of the notional mid-range offence and the application of the standard non-parole period. 

31Having regard to the nature of the injuries, and in the absence of any evidence establishing ongoing physical sequelae from the injuries, it was not erroneous, in my opinion, for the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that his Honour did. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in his classification of Count 1 as being substantially below mid-range 

Ground 3: The degree of departure from the applicable standard non-parole period is so great that it manifests error. 

32The Crown argued Grounds 2 and 3 together as raising related issues. 

33Ground 2 requires consideration of a number of discrete matters said to constitute sentencing error in the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence in Count 1 and, in particular, in respect of the classification of the offence as being substantially below mid-range. 

34In relation to Ground 2, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had regard to specific matters that explain the approach taken by him in determining the degree of departure on the non-parole period imposed in respect of Count 1. 

35In this respect, reference was, firstly, made to a submission by counsel for the respondents (which it was suggested was accepted by the sentencing judge) concerning the issue of ""provocation"" , namely, that the offences ""did not occur in a vacuum"" , but that the offences occurred in circumstances where they had been ""provoked"" (Remarks on Sentence, 8.1) by two previous events. 

36The first of these events related to a disagreement that had arisen before the date of the offences between Medhat Mankaryous' sister-in-law and Rachael Deering. The second occurred four days prior to the offences when Rachael Deering's sister was said to have assaulted Medhat Mankaryous' sister-in-law. 

37The sentencing judge referred to counsel's submissions in the following terms (Remarks on Sentence at p.7 to 8):- 

""... Ms McIntosh points out that these offences did not occur in a vacuum but they were provoked by two previous situations, namely, the acrimonious fallout between the sister-in-law of Medhat and the victim in the present case, the victim Rachael in the present case. And furthermore, the assault by the sister of the victim Rachael, in the sister-in-law of Medhat. That assault took place, Ms McIntosh emphasises, that that took place only four days prior to the incident, which was the subject of these charges."" 

38It does appear that the sentencing judge, after reciting the submissions on a number of matters by Ms McIntosh of counsel who appeared on behalf of the respondent, Medhat Mankaryous, accepted the submission. Additionally, his Honour appears to have accepted a submission made on behalf of the respondents to the effect that there was ""... one kick and one punch"" . His Honour stated in this respect (Remarks on Sentence at p.9 to 10):- 

""... Although my mind has fluctuated in this matter, I have decided, having regard to the fact that this was one blow, that is one kick and one punch, and having regard to the fact that the injuries are not continuing injuries and having regard to the background to this matter, that is the history of knowledge between the parties, I have classified this as being substantially below the mid-range of seriousness and it hardly needs to be said that these crimes are unusual in the sense that they were not committed for profit or from greed."" 

39Earlier in the Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge accepted the submission made by Ms McIntosh that one could not be certain ""... whether the injuries that were occasioned to the victim were occasioned by the blow or by the fall or by both ..."" (Remarks on Sentence at p.8). 

40Aside from these two matters, the Crown also relied upon the fact that the sentencing judge made no reference in his Remarks on Sentence to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 or to the relevant principles as to general or specific deterrence. Further, it was contended that his Honour gave little or no attention to how he viewed the seriousness of Count 2. 

41On the point as to the offences not having occurred in a vacuum, the Crown accepted that, whilst motive is always a relevant factor affecting the moral culpability of the offender, in the present case, the purpose of the offence was to inflict injury upon Rachael Deering in her own home to teach her a lesson and to intimidate her. 

42This, the Crown argued, was not a case, for example, involving retribution for a victim who had sexually assaulted another close family member. It involved the belief that two items of clothing had been taken. 

43Reliance was also placed upon the observations of Howie J in R v Dole & Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 101 at [6] to the following effect:- 

""Provocation is, in my opinion, an inapt concept when dealing with vigilante conduct such as this."" 

44The Crown's contention was that it is difficult to see how the actions of Ms Deering's sister could be regarded as having ""provoked"" the respondents to take revenge upon her. I accept that submission. 

45The Crown further submitted that motivation borne of family loyalty to redress some perceived wrong is of negligible mitigating value: R v Maisey [2005 NSWCCA 347 at [68]; Duffy & Mangan v R [2009] NSWCCA 304 at [25]. That proposition is, in my opinion, apposite in the present case. 

46In relation to the ""one kick and one punch"" point, the Crown observed that assaults involving a single blow and kick can cause greater injury than multiple blows. The injuries to the victim in this case were to the face and were said to be ""nasty"" as were the circumstances in which they occurred. 

47Whilst the Crown observed that the offence might have been more serious had the assault extended over a longer period and the injuries greater, nevertheless that did not make any less what occurred. 

48The Crown additionally relied, as a point of comparison with the more serious offence under s.98 of the Crimes Act (Count 1), upon the fact that the guideline judgment in Henry (supra) nominated a head sentence of between of between 4 and 5 years in relation to an offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act (armed robbery, without wounding: maximum penalty, 20 years) after a plea of guilty. The Henry guideline took into account a 10% discount for the plea. 

49Reference was made to the observations in R v PB [2008] NSWCCA 109 (a Crown appeal) in which Bell JA (as her Honour then was) (with whom Johnson and McCallum JJ agreed) stated:- 

""24. His Honour appears to have overlooked the fact that this was an aggravated offence under s.98 which carries a higher maximum penalty than the maximum penalty for the guideline offence ... 

24. ... The relevance of the Henry guideline to the sentencing of the respondent is that it states a range that is below the range that is appropriate for this offence."" 

50In the present proceedings, the Crown contended that, for the purpose of analysis, the wounding of Rachael Deering was left out of account (it being the aggravating feature in s.98), and that, in any event, Count 1 was a significantly more serious offence than an offence which fell within the Henry guideline. In this respect, the Crown contended (Crown's written submissions at [34]:- 

""... An attack by two males upon a woman in her own home and inflicting actual physical violence upon her, with one brandishing a pistol, is objectively more serious than a brief threat made to a shopkeeper by a single man armed with a weapon, the type of offence in Henry ."" 

51On the question of planning, the Crown submitted that it appeared that the sentencing judge accepted a submission made by counsel for one of the respondents that there had been a small degree of planning. The Crown contended that the facts indicated a degree of planning that was more than ""limited"" . 

52The Crown also emphasised an on-going threat made by the respondents prior to their departure, namely, threatening to shoot the victims if they complained to the police. The Crown submission, accordingly, was in the following terms (at [36] and [37]):- 

""36. The point is that if the present case was more serious than Henry , it points to a greater starting head sentence than the 4 or 5 years. And, as Howie J (with whom Simpson and Hislop JJ agreed) in R v Dean Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 said (at [34]): 'it is axiomatic that a person charged with a s.98 offence should receive a heavier sentence than a similar offender charged with a s.97 offence'. 

37. The aggravating feature of the s.98 offence over and above the Henry guideline considerations, involving the nasty injuries to Rachael Deering, occurred in her own home and in circumstances of degradation in front of the man with whom she lived. The objective seriousness of the offence was at least mid-range."" 

53As to the standard non-parole period prescribed for a s.98 offence, the Crown argued that the guideline has, in relevant respects, been superseded by the standard non-parole period: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [176]. The Crown's contention was that the sentencing judge gave no reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period which, as earlier noted, was 7 years. 

54The Crown submitted that the classification of the offence as one ""substantially below mid-range"" was wrong. Alternatively, it was argued that, even if the offence could be said to be ""below"" mid-range of objective seriousness, on no view of the circumstances of the offence under s.98 could it be said that it was so far below mid-range as to warrant a non-parole period being 35% of the standard non-parole period. That was said to result in a failure of ""an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offence regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation"" : R v Knight & Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283 at [47]. 

55On behalf of the respondents, Ms Francis, in her written submissions, acknowledged that joint enterprise principles exposed each offender to liability for the acts of the other. 

56The complaints made by the Crown with respect to the remarks on sentence were said to be better understood as involving infelicity rather than appellable error. So understood, it was submitted, the complaint is really one of manifest inadequacy. 

57The reference by the sentencing judge to the respondents having been ""provoked"" was a term that had been used in order to characterise the events that led up to the commission of the offences. It was contended that the sentencing judge was not using that word in the context of it being a mitigating factor in the terms of s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . 

58The history of the background to the offences, it was submitted, was relevant. If that were not considered, then, it was observed, the crime would have had a particular perversity. 

59Ms Francis noted that the maximum penalty for an offence under s.98 is 25 years imprisonment. The maximum would apply to offending of the highest order. On that basis, the notional or putative mid-range offence, it was argued, was of ""a very high order"" : Respondents' written submissions at 2.9. 

60The provisions of s.98, it was emphasised, apply to offences such as well- planned and executed armed robberies in company that involve considerable planning and sophistication with considerable risk to public safety. The respondents' offences, it was submitted, were considerably less serious. 

61Seen in that light and having regard to the facts associated with the offences, it was contended for both respondents that the sentencing judge's evaluation that the s.98 offences were ""substantially below mid-range"" was open. 

62Ms Francis further submitted that the sentencing judge had not fallen into patent error. 

Ground 4: His Honour erred in his approach to the respondent's criminal history 

63The Crown's contention was that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the fact that the respondent, Michael Mankaryous, was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences: s.21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

64The Crown acknowledged that the sentencing judge referred (at Remarks on Sentence, p.10) to the fact that that respondent had been subject to three good behaviour bonds at the time of the offences but that that matter was mentioned in the context of determining the sentence in respect of respondent Medhat Mankaryous and for parity considerations but not when considering the circumstances of the criminality of the respondent, Michael Mankaryous. Accordingly, it was submitted, the sentencing judge had failed to take into account a relevant circumstance of aggravation. 

65The Crown further criticised the observation of the sentencing judge that the respondent Michael Mankaryous' antecedents ""do not assist him"" (Remarks on Sentence, 5.4). It was said that this was an understatement and that his record was indicative of a history of violence. 

66Further criticism was directed to the sentencing judge's observations concerning the same respondent's prison discipline offences as having been ""three minor mishaps"" and ""only three minor misconduct charges"" (Remarks on Sentence, 4.4). 

67It was said that the prison offences had a ""particular sting"" because they involved assault as well as offences of intimidation. The subject offences, it was observed, involved both the intimidation and the assault of Ms Deering. 

68The submission of the respondents was that breach of conditional liberty can have an elevating impact upon the appropriate sentence by reason of the issue of deterrence and related matters but is not to be regarded as objectively aggravating the seriousness of the offence. 

69In the present proceedings, the sentencing judge, having heard the evidence of the respondent, Michael Mankaryous, was persuaded that the breach of conditional liberty did not have a significant elevating impact upon penalty. It was submitted that this was not a case in which the sentencing judge simply overlooked the matter. 

70It was also observed that the sentencing judge stated (Remarks on Sentence, 5.5):- 

""There is no doubt that his antecedents do not assist him ."" 

71The Crown, however, pointed out that this was stated in a completely different context, namely, in the context of considering the sentence to be imposed in respect of the respondent, Medhat Mankaryous. 

Ground 5: It was not open to his Honour to find the respondent had ""turned over a new leaf"" and was unlikely to re-offend 

72The Crown argued that these findings were based on two factors. The first was stated to be the fact that Michael Mankaryous had ""undergone counselling and education in relation to drug and alcohol rehabilitation"" (Remarks on Sentence, 3.9). The second arose from the respondent's statement in evidence ""I want to get my life on track"" (transcript, 10.12). 

73The Crown, in relation to the first matter, drew attention to the pre-sentence report (p.1), where it was noted that, whilst the respondent was being supervised during the period of the bonds, he, in fact, had failed to attend programmes. When asked in evidence whether counselling for drug and alcohol during the period of the bonds did him any good, the respondent replied in the negative (transcript, 9.5 and following). 

74The counselling, the Crown observed, came about to address the respondent's anger following misconduct offences in gaol and did not provide justification for a finding that he had turned over a new leaf and was willing to pursue rehabilitation. 

75Further, the pre-sentence report under the heading ""Attitude to the Offences"" recorded (p.3.1) referred to Michael Mankaryous' limited insight into his offending ""however, he claimed that he is mainly sorry for the impact his behaviour has had on his partner and the children"" . 

76As to the second matter - the respondent's statement as to wanting to get his life back on track - it was said that this had to be measured against his past record which was one of a consistent pattern of breaching bonds. It was again emphasised that the present offences were committed whilst he was on conditional liberty. The expectation of rehabilitation, accordingly, the Crown argued had not been realised and the mechanism designed for it had failed to achieve its purpose. In light of the respondent's breaches of prison discipline, it was contended that it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that Michael Mankaryous had turned over a new leaf and was unlikely to re-offend. 

77Ms Francis submitted that it was open to the judge to make the finding particularly as his Honour had the opportunity of assessing Michael Mankaryous' credibility. 

78It was argued that the decision in Licastro v R [2008] NSWCCA 131 was of no assistance having regard to the factual circumstances of the present case. The error in that case, it was noted, related to a finding as to good prospects of rehabilitation. The present case was to be distinguished both in terms of its facts and as a matter of principle. The assessment made, it was said, was based significantly upon the evaluation of the oral evidence given at the sentencing hearing and this Court was not in a position of making an assessment on the matter. 

Ground 6: His Honour failed to assess the seriousness of Count 2 

79The Crown submitted that although there was no prescribed standard non-parole period for the offence the subject of Count 2, the sentencing judge was nonetheless required, under general principles of sentencing, required to access the extent of the criminality of the respondents in terms of both objective and subjective factors. This, the Crown contended, his Honour failed to do. 

80Ms Francis argued on behalf of the respondents that the sentencing judge was not required in the circumstances in which the remarks were given to express where in the scale of seriousness the offence lay. 

81It was said that salient aspects of the offence were carefully weighed in the balance. It was further submitted, in effect, that sentencing judges are not, where no standard non-parole period is prescribed, required to express a finding in terms of a scale of objective seriousness. 

Ground 7: His Honour erred in making the sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2 entirely concurrent 

82The Crown criticised the sentencing judge's finding ""that this was one episode of crime and to accumulate the sentence would result in an excessive punishment"" (Remarks on Sentence, 11.3). 

83The Crown referred to the principles that relate to the question of the accumulation of sentences: R v Cahayadi [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27]; R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [52]. Those principles, the Crown argued, were not properly applied in the present case. The Crown submission was:- 

""51 ... Mr Hinton was not simply assaulted by being pushed to the ground sustaining grazing by way of actual bodily harm. A pistol was trust in his face terrifying him. A proper exercise of discretion, as the Judge purported to exercise, would not have made the sentences completely concurrent. This did not recognise the harm to each victim. It was not enough that each was assaulted during the 'one episode of crime'. Nor would partial accumulation result in excessive overall punishment."" 

84The Crown further argued that the reasons provided by the sentencing judge for concurrency of sentences did not constitute a proper basis for making the sentences wholly concurrent. It was argued that his Honour's approach constituted an error of principle. 

85Ms Francis submitted that the present case was one where, so far as both respondents were concerned, the criminality of the two offences was overlapping in terms of both the state of mind element in them at the time of the offending is concerned and the physical facts concerning the offences. The fact that there were two victims present during the commission of each offence was relevant to the penalty imposed in respect of each offence but did not require the accumulation of sentences for each offence. 

86It was contended that the fundamental question was whether the sentences reflected the total criminality and, when so considered, concurrency of sentences was open in this case. 

Ground 8: His Honour was in error in finding special circumstances 

Ground 9: The sentences, both individually and when combined, were manifestly inadequate 

87The Crown argued that the sentence imposed for the s.98 offence was unduly lenient for the reasons set out in its written submissions. In particular, the fact that it was committed in breach of conditional liberty and occurred against a background of a persistent criminal history of violence was not properly taken into account. The Crown also complained about the concurrency of the sentence imposed for the s.97 offence. 

88Applying the statutory ratio of 75% to the head sentence of 4 years and 6 months produced a non-parole period of 40.5 months or 3.37 years. The Crown argued that that fact indicated that an inadequate non-parole period had been set in this case. 

89The Crown, finally, contended that there was no basis for a finding of special circumstances. 

(3) Grounds of appeal: Medhat Mankaryous 

90In respect of the respondent Medhat Mankaryous, the Crown noted the following findings were made:- 

""(1) The same findings as in (a), (b) and (c) above. 

(2) A 10% discount for the plea (Remarks on Sentence, 9.8). 

(3) Excellent prospects of rehabilitation (Remarks on Sentence, 9.5) and 'far more persuasive' than his brother (Remarks on Sentence, 10.7). 

(4) He would have a justifiable sense of grievance if he did not receive a substantially lesser sentence than Michael (Remarks on Sentence, 10.4)."" 

Grounds 1, 2 and 3 

91As indicated above, Grounds 1, 2 and 3 discussed above are relied upon respect of both respondents. Accordingly, I will proceed to deal with the remaining grounds, that is, Grounds 4 to 9. 

Ground 4: His Honour erred in firstly determining manifestly inadequate sentences in respect of Michael Mankaryous and then fixing sentences for Medhat Mankaryous as a proportion of them 

92The Crown submission was that the sentencing judge adopted the following approach in sentencing the respondent, Medhat Mankaryous. Firstly, closely in line with the submissions of counsel for Michael Mankaryous (namely, that there should be a total sentence of 4 to 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years (Remarks on Sentence, 5)), a sentence involving a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 1 month was imposed. 

93The sentencing judge's next step was said to be based upon a notion of parity or proportionality. On that basis, the sentencing judge stated that Medhat Mankaryous would have a ""justifiable sense of grievance if he did not receive a substantially lesser sentence that"" his brother Michael (Remarks on Sentence, 10). 

94The sentencing judge identified points of distinction relating to the respondents' criminal history as well as the fact that Michael Mankaryous was on conditional liberty at the time of the subject offences. Reference was also made to their respective rehabilitative progress and subjective cases. I shall return to this latter aspect on the question of re-sentencing. 

95The Crown's complaint also was that there were other factors relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences to which the sentencing judge did not refer. Medhat Mankaryous was older than his brother and, as the pre-sentence report noted, he took on the ""patriarchal role"" . Furthermore, it was he who was the one who brought the look-alike pistol to the premises. 

96The Crown contended, firstly, that, had the sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of Medhat Mankaryous' offending before considering what has been referred to in argument as the parity or proportionality issue, then his Honour may well have realised that the sentence being imposed, in particular, the non-parole period, was manifestly inadequate. 

97Ms Francis on behalf of Medhat Mankaryous characterised the asserted error as being an error of process. This was a reference to the fact that the sentencing judge first determined the appropriate sentence in respect of Michael Mankaryous and then determined the sentence for Medhat Mankaryous on a proportional basis to the sentences to be imposed on Michael Mankaryous. 

98It was said that the Crown's argument in this regard, in effect, involved the same complaint as had earlier been made in respect of Michael Mankaryous, that is to say, alleged error affecting the sentences imposed in respect of the latter's offending which was said to have effectively been perpetuated in the imposition of the lesser sentences imposed in respect of Medhat Mankaryous. 

99Ms Francis contested the proposition that the sentencing judge failed to conclude that the ""patriarchal role"" played by Medhat Mankaryous ought to have an elevating effect. There was no warrant for a determination based upon the fact that Medhat Mankaryous was several years older than his brother. 

100Additionally, reliance was placed upon the principles of joint enterprise and that, taking those principles into account, Medhat Mankaryous' involvement could not be said to be more objectively serious on account of the fact that he carried the pistol. 

101Accordingly, it was submitted there was no error in respect of the last-mentioned matters nor in the fixing of proportionate sentences. 

Ground 5: His Honour erred in reducing the statutory ratio specified in s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without a finding of ""special circumstances"" 

102The Crown's complaint was that the sentencing judge did not make any finding of ""special circumstances"" with respect to the sentences imposed upon the respondent, Medhat Mankaryous. Section 44 of the above Act requires a judge who finds special circumstances to make a record of the reasons for that decision and that those requirements were mandatory: R v Hamieh [2010] NSWCCA 189 at [72]. 

103Accordingly, the Crown argued that, without a finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period would be 3 years and not, as imposed, a non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months. 

104Ms Francis argued that the sentencing judge made a proper finding of special circumstances which she contended had been conceded by the Crown at first instance. 

105The Crown did not, on the hearing of the appeal, contest that it had, in fact, adopted that position below. In any event, I am of the opinion that, having regard to the evidence, a sound basis exists for a finding of special circumstances in the case of Medhat Mankaryous. 

Ground 6: His Honour failed to assess the seriousness of Count 2 

Ground 7: His Honour erred in making the sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2 entirely concurrent 

106The Crown repeated and relied upon the submissions made in respect of Michael Mankaryous in respect of these two grounds. 

Ground 8: His Honour gave too much weight to subjective features 

107The Crown argued that the sentencing judge allowed attention to the respondents' subjective considerations ""... to overshadow the objective seriousness of the offences and the strong need for general deterrence in cases such as these"" : R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 

108On behalf of the respondent, Ms Francis submitted that this was simply a submission or complaint as to manifest inadequacy. 

Ground 9: The sentences, both individually and when combined, were manifestly inadequate 

109The Crown submitted that a sentence involving a non-parole period of 1 year, 5 months in respect of a home invasion, where the occupants were threatened by two men with a gun and where violence was used was very lenient indeed. 

110On behalf of the respondent, Ms Francis submitted that the sentencing judge in respect of both respondents had adopted starting points in excess of 4 years full time imprisonment. 

111The six month differential was said to be justified on account of subjective factors and the role that they played in fixing the head sentence. 

112It was clear that the sentencing judge was persuaded that the subjective factors did have a greater role to play in fixing the non-parole period concerning Medhat Mankaryous and that this was a proper exercise of discretion. The observations of Kirby J in Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54 at [68] were relied upon. 

113It was argued for both respondents that it was self-evident that the sentences imposed in respect of the s.97 offence conformed with the Henry guideline and that the Crown, in effect, was urging a conclusion of inadequacy and reliance on the s.98 offence. The sentences in respect of the latter, it was contended, took into account the fact of wounding of the victim, Ms Deering, and that the offences were committed in the victims' home. 

114It was further submitted that it was very relevant to have regard to the evidence which did not suggest that the force of the blow or the kick to Ms Deering itself were themselves of such a severity as to cause wounding or other injuries. This, in turn, was relevant to assessing the severity of the force used. 

115Again, reference was made by Ms Francis to the fact that s.98 offences may comprehend at the upper end of the range grievous bodily harm and that this was relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness of the s.98 offences in the present case. Again the force employed was said to be limited. 

116It was acknowledged that the fact that the offence was committed in the victims' home was a material factor, but it was said to have involved an intrusion by persons who were known to the victims in circumstances where the victims understood the motive. This, it was said, ameliorated significantly the aggravating feature of the intrusion. 

117Finally, so far as the finding of special circumstances was concerned, it was said that this was entirely appropriate in the case of Medhat Mankaryous, as he had a powerful subjective case. Additionally, when properly assessed, the wounding would not justify a sentence that was greater than one envisaged by the guideline. 

118Accordingly, the contention was that the sentences are not manifestly inadequate. 

Consideration 

119Whilst the Remarks on Sentence reflect that particular attention was given by the sentencing judge to the matters that were raised and relied upon by counsel for the parties, the actual analysis and the consideration given to the assessment of the objective criminality of the offences the subject of Counts 1 and 2 was in fairly short form. The relevant parts of the Remarks on Sentence in this respect are to be found at pp.9-10. Although these are set out earlier in this judgment, for convenience of reference, I reproduce here the relevant remarks:- 

""... Although my mind has fluctuated in this matter, I have decided, having regard to the fact that this was one blow, that is one kick and one punch, and having regard to the fact that the injuries are not continuing injuries and having regard to the background to this matter, that is the history of knowledge between the parties, I have classified this as being substantially below the mid-range of seriousness and it hardly needs to be said that these crimes are unusual in the sense that they were not committed for profit or from greed."" 

120A little earlier, the sentencing judge referred to submissions made on behalf of both respondents in relation to subjective matters and indicated his acceptance of many of those submissions and that, in the case of Michael Mankaryous, he accepted the submission that a finding of special circumstances should be made. 

121His Honour also accepted (p.8) the submission made on behalf of Medhat Mankaryous that one could not be certain whether the injuries that were occasioned to the victim (a reference to Ms Deering) were occasioned by the blow or by the fall or by both. 

122His Honour also referred, as I have earlier indicated, to his acceptance of the proposition that there was no evidence of any continuing effect of the injuries to the victim. 

123In relation to the matters set out in the extract from the remarks in paragraph [119] above as having been taken into account in classifying the offence in Count 1 as below the mid-range of seriousness, I am of the opinion that that the Crown is correct in its contention that those matters themselves could not justify that classification. In particular:- 

(1) As to the ""one kick and one punch"" issue, the remarks do not disclose that his Honour gave due regard to the matters established by the agreed facts, namely:- 

(a) That Michael Mankaryous punched Ms Deering to the face, which had the effect of knocking her to the ground. 

(b) That in consequence, she hit her head on a television cabinet on the way to the floor. 

(c) That she was kicked in the head by Medhat Mankaryous while she was on the floor. 

124In addition to the above, so far as the victim Mr Hinton was concerned, there was no reference by the sentencing judge to the fact that he was assaulted by Michael Mankaryous upon the forced entry into the premises and was pushed to the ground. 

125In addition, there was no reference to the fact that the offenders threatened the victims that they would come back and shoot them if the police were called nor any reference to their statement that they would be back to collect $5,000. 

126Furthermore, there was no reference to the nature of the injuries suffered by Ms Deering, including the fact that she was (Agreed Facts at pp.2 to 3):- 

""... terrified, bled profusely, was in considerable pain, and received the following injuries: 

Head 

A 4cm crescent-shaped, full thickness, gaping laceration to the left side of her head, above the forehead, just back from the hairline. 

Face 

1. A 1 cm, straight, oblique laceration involving the dermis above her left eye, close to the left eyebrow. 

2. A 1.5 cm, straight, vertical laceration involving the full thickness of her left upper lip, extending to the edge of the vermilion border of the lip. 

3. A 3 cm, straight, horizontal gaping laceration, 5 mm below the vermilion border of her lower lip in the centre of her chin. This laceration was almost full thickness, ie, Deep dermal. 

4. Tenderness to palpation over the bridge of the nose and left maxillia . 

Oral 

1. Her two front upper teeth (left upper 1 and right upper 1) were broken horizontally near the gum line and splintered remnants of the stumps of the teeth were visible. 

2. A 2 cm, straight, horizontal laceration on the inside of the bottom lip. This laceration was 1-2 mm deep. 

These injuries were sutured and dressed in Nepean Hospital. 

Mr HINTON received grazing to the back and side."" 

127On a close examination of the facts concerning the assaults and their effects, I am of the opinion that to simply characterise them as ""one kick and one punch"" would obscure the significance of what was a brutal attack upon the female victim, the punch being sufficient to cause her to sustain the injuries referred to above and for the kick to the head whilst she was on the ground was a separate and further callous and brutal act. 

128In determining the objective seriousness of the offence, it is evident that the sentencing judge also proceeded upon an acceptance of the argument for the respondents as to ""the background in this matter"" . 

129Whilst there had been an association between the respondents and one or both of the victims and there had been a history of disputation, that does not, in my respectful opinion, constitute a ""background"" to the matter which would ameliorate the objective seriousness of the offences involved in Counts 1 and 2. 

130A full and proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences would, in my opinion, require weight to be attached to the following matters:- 

(1) The respondents' forced entry into the victims' premises (described as a ""home invasion"" ). 

(2) The use of a look-alike pistol which was obviously intended, and did, create fear and compliance by the victims. 

(3) The physical assaults and the consequences of those assaults as described above. 

(4) That there was clearly a degree of planning involved in the commission of the offences. 

(5) The fact that the victims and the respondents were known to each other does not, in my assessment, offset the seriousness of what has been described as the vigilante actions. 

(6) In the course of walking through the rooms of the victims' home a purse and a mobile phone belonging to Ms Deering were taken and money, a wallet and mobile phone belonging to Mr Hinton were taken. 

(7) That the victims were then subjected to a threat by the offenders that they would come back and shoot both of them if the police were called. 

(8) The statement by the respondents that they would be back to collect $5,000. 

131The Agreed Statement of Facts records the fact that, as a result of the respondents' actions, Ms Deering ""... was terrified, bled profusely, was in considerable pain and received the following injuries ..."" (set out above). 

132In addition, although it is clear the sentencing judge was fully aware of the fact that Michael Mankaryous was the subject of three good behaviour bonds at the time of the offences, his Honour did not appear to place any weight upon that fact in determining his culpability. 

133On the assessment of subjective factors, in my opinion, no criticism can be made of the sentencing judge's assessment of the subjective factors concerning Medhat Mankaryous. However, I have concluded that his Honour gave undue weight to the evidence given at the sentencing hearing by Michael Mankaryous in accepting that he had ""turned over a new leaf"" . In that respect, I consider that undue weight was given to the oral evidence of Michael Mankaryous at the sentencing hearing. 

134The Pre-sentence Report dated 27 January 2011 did not, in my assessment, record the proposition that Michael Mankaryous had, as it was put, turned over a new leaf. The relevant history is recorded in the report in the following terms (p.1):- 

""Mr Mankaryous was the subject of supervision on an 18 month Section 9 Bond imposed on 12 March 2007; his response to supervision was deemed poor. On 30 October 2008, he was supervised on another Section 9 Bond which was later revoked and he was then the subject of two 12 month Section 12 Bonds imposed on 17 December 2008. Records indicated that during the supervision period he was generally non-compliant with reporting directions and failure to attend programs. It would appear that the current offences constitute a breach of the Section 12 Bonds."" 

135In relation to the offending, the Pre-sentence Report noted that Mr Mankaryous admitted that he ""took the law in my own hands"" (p.2). It also records him saying ""I was an idiot for doing this"" and expressed regret for causing harm to the female victim, but as the author of the report observed, he was ""... mainly sorry for the impact that his behaviour has had on his partner and the children"" (p.3). 

136In relation to Michael Mankaryous' conduct in custody, the report records:- 

"" Performance in custody 

Mr Mankaryous is reported to have been abusive and aggressive towards custodial staff on a number of occasions since his incarceration until 24 December 2010, when it was noted that he was polite to staff and other inmates following his transfer to another wing at Parklea CC. He has incurred three misconduct charges between 9 May 2009 and 7 October 2010. He is currently employed as a cleaner in his accommodation unit. 

The offender has attended several psychological counselling sessions at Parklea CC to address his anger issues."" 

137Mr Mankaryous conceded in cross-examination that the discipline offences arose out of an incident involving intimidation by him in May 2009 and an assault by him in May 2009 and another incident of intimidation by him in October 2010. These have been dealt with by way of ""internal punishment"" . 

138On the evidence, there have been no further adverse incidents since December 2010, that is some six weeks or so before the sentencing hearing in February 2011. 

139In relation to the question of concurrency and accumulation, although the sentencing judge did not separately analyse the objective seriousness of the offences, his Honour was clearly aware of the circumstances and matters constituting the offences as set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts. Although dealt with briefly, it is at least implicit in the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour considered that, rather than accumulating the sentences, the sentence to be imposed in respect of Count 1 would be determined with regard to the criminality that established the Count 2 offence. 

140There is a considerable overlap between the circumstances involving Counts 1 and 2, although there are added and distinguishing features between the two offences. Not the least of these was that it involved two different victims and the unlawful taking of the possessions of each one of them. In addition, as earlier stated, both were the subject of assaults. 

141The principles concerning concurrency and accumulation are well established: Cahayadi (supra) and XX (supra) at [52]. 

142However, each case is to be assessed having regard to its particular facts and circumstances. Although there existed a basis for some accumulation, I have reached the conclusion that it was open, on the particular facts of this case, to the sentencing judge to determine a sentence in respect of Count 2 that would take into account the concurrent circumstances involving both victims. In other words, by reason of the close interrelationship between the facts to which I have referred, such an approach would, I believe, have achieved a sentence which would have regard to the criminality of both offences. 

143I have, however, concluded that the sentencing judge's particular determination that the offence in Count 1 was substantially below the mid-range of seriousness for such offences, when all circumstances are considered, manifests appellable error. 

144Ms Francis, in her supplementary written submissions dated 28 June 2011, addressed the residual discretion in this Court not to interfere with the sentences imposed even if appellable error was established. Reliance was placed upon the decision in this Court in R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489 and JW (supra). 

145Particular reliance in this respect was placed upon what was described as an expectation in Michael Mankaryous of his release on parole on 8 August 2011 (approximately six weeks away) and the efforts that he has made towards rehabilitation in the hope that he would be released from custody at that time. Reliance was also placed upon the favourable observations made by the sentencing judge in respect of him as being ""at the cross-roads"" and that a degree of leniency would have a positive impact on his prospects for rehabilitation. It was submitted, for this Court to intervene and re-sentence the respondents would place the progress they had made at risk. 

Re-sentencing 

The respondent, Michael Mankaryous 

146I turn, firstly, to the question of the re-sentencing approach to be taken in respect of the respondent, Michael Mankaryous, sentencing error having been established in respect of the sentences imposed by the District Court. 

147In JW (supra), Spigelman CJ at [146] referred to the long line of authority which distinguishes, on a Crown appeal, between the discretion to intervene and the sentence to be imposed. As his Honour there stated ""... That distinction remains after the enactment of s.68A ..."" (a reference to s.68A of the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act 2001 inserted by the ""Crimes (Appeal & Review) Amendment Double Jeopardy Act 2009). 

148Accordingly, this Court retains the discretion in relation to its response to a Crown appeal by the words in s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act . 

149The real question on the question of re-sentencing the respondents is whether a proper basis exists for the exercise of the residual discretion which, Ms Francis submitted, should be exercised in the disposition of the appeal. The submission was:- 

""In respect of Michael Mankaryous, particular emphasis ought to be made of his looming expectation to be released to parole on 8 August of this year (six weeks away) and the efforts towards rehabilitation he has made in that hope."" 

150It was further submitted that the sentencing judge had accepted that the respondent, Michael Mankaryous, was ""at the crossroads"" . The sentencing judge's acceptance of that proposition was said to be based on the following matters:- 

(1) That he had spent two years in custody since the commission of the offences. 

(2) That it was his first time in full-time custody. 

(3) He had taken advantage of the rehabilitative schemes which it has offered. 

151It was further contended that ""... As the primary Judge anticipated"" , a degree of leniency in the case had had a positive impact on Michael Mankaryous' prospects. The submission in this respect was ""... To intervene would place the progress of this respondent at risk"" . Reliance was placed upon the evidence placed before this Court which was said to be to the effect that Michael Mankaryous' rehabilitation ""... has continued to progress well since the sentences were imposed"" . 

152The respondent, Michael Mankaryous, relies, in the event that this Court upholds the Crown appeal, upon the following affidavits as potentially relevant on re-sentencing:- 

(1) Affidavit of Claire Wasley, solicitor, affirmed 27 June 2011 attaching an undated letter from Major Brian Wilson, Salvation Army Chaplain. 

(2) Affidavit of Michael Mankaryous affirmed 28 June 2011. 

(3) Affidavit of Michael Mankaryous sworn 24 June 2011. 

153The Crown relied upon an affidavit of Tamar Lopis, solicitor, affirmed 27 June 2011 attaching correspondence from the Manager, Offender Services & Programmes (Corrective Services) dated 27 June 2011. 

154I have considered all the objective circumstances of the offences to which I have earlier referred and have concluded that the offence in relation to Count 1 establishes that it was close to the mid-range of seriousness for an offence under s.98 of the Crimes Act . 

155In determining sentence, the fact that Michael Mankaryous was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences was a very material matter and his criminal history involving offences of violence were matters disentitling him to leniency. 

156However, although his custodial conduct has attracted disciplinary measures, the evidence does establish that there has been an improvement in his conduct in custody since mid-December 2010 and that he has been actively engaged in the number of courses of study and training to date. In particular, the evidence indicates that he has completed some sessions in the Getting Smart Programme and the respondent has stated that he has been actively engaged in that aspect of his rehabilitation from which he says he has received benefit and insight including, in particular, in relation to drug and alcohol issues. 

157Since being in custody, he has undertaken an education course and has completed Certificate 1 in Access to Work and Training and a National OH&S Construction Induction Training through TAFE. He has recently been undertaking a first aid course and a computer technology course. 

158The letter from the Manager, Offender Services & Programmes attached to the affidavit of Mr Lopis confirms the respondent's evidence in certain material respects. In particular, it confirms that he initially saw a psychologist on three occasions and that he is scheduled to start the CALM (Anger Management) Programme as at the date of the letter. 

159It also confirms that the respondent has been doing the Getting Smart (Alcohol and Other Drug) Programme and has completed four of the 12 sessions and that he should be able to complete the programme prior to release if he undertakes ""catch up"" sessions. The Manager, Offender & Services Programmes also confirmed the education and vocational training that he has undertaken. 

Exercise of the residual discretion 

160The term of the non-parole period imposed on Michael Mankaryous by the sentencing judge will expire on 8 August 2011. It has been contended on the respondent's behalf that he has an expectation that he will be release to parole on 8 August 2011. 

161The residual discretion has been exercised in certain Crown appeals where there has been strong evidence as to the rehabilitation of the offender who has been released from custody or whose release is imminent. In R v Kyroglou [1999] NSWCCA 106 the offender had been sentenced in respect of a number of offences including an offence of armed robbery contrary to s.97(1) of the Crimes Act . Notwithstanding the conclusion of this Court in that case that the sentence imposed had been grossly inadequate, the Court dismissed the Crown appeal. 

162In Kyroglou (supra), the offender had been released from custody and he had been actively and successfully participating in drug counselling therapy. Newman J at [61] and [62], with whom Hulme (RS Hulme) and Simpson JJ agreed, stated:- 

""61. If it were not for the extraordinary success of this respondent's rehabilitation, I would have been constrained to have imposed a sentence ... which would have resulted in the respondent being returned to custody. Such is the success of the rehabilitation programme being carried out by the respondent that I am of the view that it should exercise its discretion and not interfere with the sentence passed. 

62. I stress that I have come to this view because of the extraordinary success of the respondent's rehabilitation programme and I make it plain that the favourable exercise of discretion to this respondent is exceptional in nature ..."" 

163In R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 (a case determined subsequent to the judgment in JW (supra)), the respondent, 25 years of age, had been sentenced in respect of a number of offences including supply of prohibited drug (ecstasy), possess prohibited weapon without permit and malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

164The judgment, delivered on 21 May 2010, noted that the non-parole period that had been imposed was due to expire on 28 February 2011. The offender had been sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. The Crown appealed pursuant to s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act . 

165Reference was made in that case by Simpson J to the evidence on re-sentence which included ""uniformly glowing reports"" from different officers at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. The respondent was described by one as ""an asset"" on the day-to-day running of the area in which he worked and that he had ""... the right attitude and commitment"" . The officer added ""one cannot fault his work ethics, application or behaviour"" . 

166The conclusion was that the material was ""quite exceptional"" and that the reports from the Corrective Services authorities indicated that ""the process of rehabilitation is well underway"" (at [114]). Simpson J concluded that this Court should not, at that stage, interfere with that process being carried to its conclusion. 

167In respect of the evidence in relation to Michael Mankaryous, I accept that the evidence does establish that, to date, he has made progress towards rehabilitation but the evidence does not, as in the cases to which I have referred, establish such exceptional progress as to warrant this Court deciding not to intervene. 

168However, the evidence which establishes that he has made progress may still be relevant in the exercise of the power to re-sentence. I have concluded that the appropriate exercise of the discretion in relation to each respondent is that, although this Court should intervene, it should not impose sentences in the terms that ought to have been imposed by the District Court. The re-sentencing should be undertaken on the basis of the respondent being sentenced to a longer head sentence only, namely, a period of 6 years, but the orders of this Court should not alter the non-parole period imposed on the respondent. 

169If this Court were to now impose on re-sentencing a sentence as ought to have been imposed in the Court below, it would, in my assessment of the evidence, create a real risk of a regression in the respondent, Michael Mankaryous' rehabilitation, particularly having regard to the not unreasonable expectation held by him of his possible or likely release to parole in the near future (August 2011). 

170The purposes of sentencing are clearly stated in s.3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . These include the purpose therein stated:- 

""(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender."" 

171I have concluded, as Simpson J did in Kyroglou (supra) that the sentencing principles concerning denunciation, deterrence and retribution should in this case and at this stage give way to the respondent's rehabilitation, especially in light of the evidence of progress made by him in that regard. 

172I consider that a finding of special circumstances should be made in relation to Michael Mankaryous in order to ensure that the respondent will have an extended period of supervision whilst on parole. I, accordingly, make a finding to that effect. 

173I consider that, for reasons earlier discussed, the sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2 should be concurrent and I have borne that in mind when determining the sentence to be imposed with respect to Count 1. I, accordingly, propose the following orders:- 

(1) Crown appeal upheld. 

(2) The sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1 and 2 be quashed. 

(3) In respect of Count 1, the respondent, Michael Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months to commence on 9 March 2009 and to expire on 8 August 2011 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 8 March 2015. 

(4) In respect of Count 2, the respondent, Michael Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months to commence on 9 March 2009 and to expire on 8 August 2011 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 8 March 2015. 

(2) The respondent, Medhat Mankaryous 

174In respect of the respondent, Medhat Mankaryous, the following affidavits are relied upon on re-sentence:- 

(1) Affidavit of Medhat Mankaryous sworn 24 June 2011. 

(2) Affidavit of Gorana Mankaryous, the wife of the respondent, affirmed on 24 June 2011. 

(3) Affidavit of Claire Wasley, solicitor, affirmed 27 June 2011attaching a copy of a Review of Classification dated 25 March 2011. 

175The Crown relied upon the affidavit Tamar Lopis, solicitor, affirmed 27 June 2011 attaching correspondence from the Manager, Offender Services & Programmes (Corrective Services) at Bathurst Correctional Centre dated 27 June 2011. 

176I have concluded that the Crown appeal should be upheld, but that, for reasons stated below, the Court should exercise its residual discretion to the extent of imposing a higher head sentence than that imposed by the sentencing judge below, but that this Court should not intervene to vary the non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months imposed by the District Court. 

177The evidence establishes, as the sentencing judge observed, that the respondent had ""a minimal criminal record"" . Furthermore, the pre-sentence report dated 2 February 2011 tendered before the sentencing judge established a number of factors that were favourable to him. He had been in continuing employment at the time of the offences. He has acknowledged the seriousness of his actions, behaviour and attitude in relation to the offences. He was noted as open and forthcoming during the preparation of the pre-sentence report. It was there recorded:- 

""He presented as a man who appears to have no history of mental health issues or drug or alcohol dependency and has been afforded the benefit of a stable and supportive environment and continues to retain a close family unit. 

It appears Mr Mankaryous' need to maintain the patriarchal role to the best of his abilities may have inadvertently impaired is judgment and contributed to his offending behaviour. To his credit, the offender appears to have gained some insight into his behaviour and attitude and is in the process of addressing these issues."" 

178The sentencing judge noted that a number of testimonials had been tendered which he described as ""extremely impressive"" , a description which I accept. 

179Medhat Mankaryous' affidavit sworn 24 June 2011 confirms that he has had no conduct charges whilst he has been in custody. He presently holds a Higher School Certificate and TAFE requirements to be a qualified plumber. He has enrolled in an Anger Management Course and he has also completed courses whilst in custody. 

180It is evident that the objective and subjective factors indicate that lesser non-parole periods should be imposed on the respondent Medhat Mankaryous in respect of Counts 1 and 2 than those to be imposed on his brother. 

181I have concluded that, by reason of the substantial progress that Medhat Mankaryous has been making whilst in custody, the residual discretion in the Court should be exercised so that, effectively, the non-parole period imposed on him by the District Court will remain. Accordingly, the orders I propose below, as in the case of Michael Mankaryous, will have the effect only of increasing the head sentence to a period of 6 years. Any other approach, in my opinion, would place his rehabilitation at risk, a consequence in the circumstances of this case that must be avoided. 

182By reason of the respondent's good prospects of rehabilitation, a finding of special circumstances should be made and I, accordingly, make a finding to that effect. 

183I accordingly propose the following orders in respect of the respondent, Medhat Mankaryous:- 

(1) Crown appeal upheld. 

(2) The sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1 and 2 be quashed. 

(3) In respect of Count 1, the respondent Medhat Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months to commence on 8 February 2011 and to expire on 7 July 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 7 February 2016. 

(4) In respect of Count 2, the respondent Medhat Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months to commence on 8 February 2011 and to expire on 7 July 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 7 February 2016. 

Orders 

184Accordingly, the orders I propose are:- 

(1) Michael Mankaryous 

(1) Crown appeal upheld. 

(2) The sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1 and 2 be quashed. 

(3) In respect of Count 1, the respondent, Michael Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months to commence on 9 March 2009 and to expire on 8 August 2011 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 8 March 2015. 

(4) In respect of Count 2, the respondent, Michael Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months to commence on 9 March 2009 and to expire on 8 August 2011 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 8 March 2015. 

(2) Medhat Mankaryous 

(1) Crown appeal upheld. 

(2) The sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1 and 2 be quashed. 

(3) In respect of Count 1, the respondent Medhat Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months to commence on 8 February 2011 and to expire on 7 July 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 7 February 2016. 

(4) In respect of Count 2, the respondent Medhat Mankaryous be sentenced to a term of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months to commence on 8 February 2011 and to expire on 7 July 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years and 7 months to expire on 7 February 2016.

		21 July 2011",2011-07-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757422,R v DX [2011] NSWDC 98,"Judgment 

1. Over thirty years ago DX committed acts of indecency towards two of his nieces. He has been charged with two offences on an indictment and there is a further list of charges to be taken into account concerning acts of indecency. 

2. He has pleaded guilty to all of these charges and his case was listed for sentence before me. 

3. There are three issues to do with the sentence proceedings which have to be resolved by me before I can proceed to sentencing DX. 

4. One of the issues is whether I take into account what is described as tendency regarding uncharged acts. I can indicate at this stage that I do not propose to take into account other uncharged acts in support of the facts which I am asked to find so far as the other two matters are concerned. 

5. Before describing what those other two matters are it would be helpful to briefly describe what the case is about. DX's family and the family of his wife's brother were very close in the 1970s and the 1980s. DX and his brother-in-law were both carpenters and used to work together. Both families used to holiday together. 

6. In about 1992 DX's brother-in-law phoned him and accused him of sexually assaulting one of his daughters. DX acknowledged that that was true. It is clear that DX had been troubled by his behaviour and by the impact it had on his niece for many years. 

7. Some years after he acknowledged the truth of the allegation he joined a church and decided to more publicly own up to what he had done. He consulted his pastors and a counsellor and was referred to a specialist psychologist. As a result of seeing the psychologist DX took himself to the police and confessed his crimes to them. 

8. He provided the police with two written documents. One became exhibit E and one became exhibit F. He was also interviewed by police and the interview was recorded. 

9. When the police contacted one of his nieces it became obvious that her recollection of what DX had done was different to his. Her recollection is different in that according to her what had happened was more serious than DX's recollection. Not only did DX acknowledge sexually assaulting that particular niece whose recollection I have referred to but he acknowledged exposing himself to that niece and her sister. Again on that issue of exposure, there is a difference of recollection between DX on the one hand and the two sisters on the other. The differences in recollection between the first niece and DX and between both nieces and DX about what happened on various occasions formed the basis of what I am asked to resolve. 

10. The name of the fist niece is CY. The name of her sister is SZ. CY's allegations are that DX, when she was five or six years old, took her for a drive in his car. They went to a place which was somewhat remote. In that place DX exposed himself and masturbated. CY recollects that in addition to that he also asked her to suck his penis. DX acknowledges that he drove her to the place, although there was some dispute about how remote it was, but denies that he asked his niece to suck his penis. The most he said occurred was that he asked her to kiss it at one stage and that the head of his penis may have touched and just gone between her lips. The prosecution obviously says that that is a matter that has to be resolved by me. The question is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on all of the evidence that what DX did was to insert his penis into his niece's mouth. 

11. The second area of dispute concerns the indecent exposure offences. DX acknowledges that they were committed in his house when the two families were together downstairs and the two girls asleep upstairs. He acknowledges that he used to go to the toilet which was an en suite off the bedroom. The girls were asleep in the bedroom normally occupied by him and his wife. DX acknowledges that when he returned from going to the toilet in the en suite he would not zip up his fly but deliberately leave his penis exposed. On the other hand CY's recollection is that it was not just exposed but that he was masturbating in their presence. SZ's recollection is that he was playing with his penis. The prosecution says that masturbating in the presence of the two girls would be a more serious version of the offence than simply exposing himself. It invites me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what DX did in addition to exposing himself on those occasions - it occurred more than once - was to masturbate in the presence of the two girls. 

12. The prosecution was represented by Mr M Barr of counsel as Crown Prosecutor and DX was represented by Ms S Goodwin of counsel. Both counsel have been of great assistance in the presentation and testing of the evidence and in their submissions. 

13. Mr Barr called CY and SZ as well as calling DX's wife, Mrs DX. Ms Goodwin called her client. 

14. In general terms CY asserts that what happened was that DX inserted his penis into her mouth and she also asserts that he masturbated in the bedroom. Mr Barr argues that both CY and SZ were consistent and believable in what they had to say and that I can accept their evidence beyond reasonable doubt. Ms Goodwin argues that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about their evidence because they should be regarded as not untruthful witnesses but unreliable witnesses. 

15. It seems to me that I should first focus on Ms Goodwin's challenge to the credibility of both of the complainants. Ms Goodwin argues that CY had an inconsistent recollection as to various factors which she sets out in her written submissions including whether DX asked her to stand in front of him and watch him play with his penis before masturbating at the car, whether or not he asked her to touch his penis before putting it into her mouth and the number of times that his penis went into her mouth. 

16. I do not regard any of those matters as providing a basis to reject the evidence of CY. So far as the first matter is concerned, all that was at issue was whether or not she happened to volunteer one piece of information in evidence-in-chief. The fact that she did not was appropriately explained by her. The second factor concerned really the order in which events occurred. It would not surprise me that a person in the position of CY may not be exactly sure of the order in which events occurred over a minute or two but still be certain about the central allegation. I do not regard there being any inconsistency between her accounts of how many times the penis went into her mouth. 

17. Ms Goodwin argued that CY's recall was mistaken or had been innocently reconstructed and that there were errors in the accuracy of her memory. Ms Goodwin pointed to questions and answers about collateral matters such as the colour of a car which DX had driven her in; the type of car which her own father drove at the time; the times that her father and uncle left for work; the colour of a singlet worn; the layout of the bedroom. I do not regard these matters as being significant enough to impact on the reliability of CY so far as her evidence of the central events is concerned. They are really collateral matters which may have had far less impact on her mind than the central matter. 

18. Ms Goodwin drew my attention to some evidence about CY and SZ discussing the incidents. What was clear, however, was that, once the matter came to proceedings being brought, they did not discuss the detail of their accounts with each other. 

19. Ms Goodwin drew my attention to SZ's recollection of what her client was doing in the bedroom and whether or not he was actually masturbating. I have looked at the evidence of SZ on that point and I am satisfied that what she recollects is consistent with DX masturbating in her presence. One matter that supports that is her recollection that he used the word masturbating on one occasion. She said that she could see him through the reflection in a mirror, which was in the room, "" playing with his penis "". Her recollection was that her uncle would come out of the toilet "" with his penis hanging out and touching it and him coming and trying to ask me to touch it "". She did not touch it. What she saw was her uncle over by the mirror and she "" glanced up and looked and saw him looking and then sort of, you know, took my eyes away because I found it revolting "". When cross-examined by Ms Goodwin about whether she actually saw him masturbate she said "" only saw him shaking it, whether that is called masturbating or not, call it what you want, shaking it, playing with it yeah "". She added that she now knows "" what masturbation is now, but back then it was like shaking it "". 

20. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence that she was giving was to the effect that DX was masturbating in her presence. 

21. I found both CY and SZ to be impressive and articulate witnesses. They were clear in their accounts and in my opinion not damaged in cross-examination. 

22. When Ms Goodwin called her client, DX, his account was consistent with there being no deliberate insertion of his penis into CY's mouth in the car incident and there being no masturbation on the occasions where he exposed himself in the bedroom to CY and SZ. 

23. Mr Barr crossexamined DX extensively about his recollection and about what he asserted were inconsistencies in his accounts given over time. Mr Barr's case is that I should reject DX's account for one or more of three reasons. One reason was that DX apparently has no accurate recollection at all so far as his account in court is concerned. Another basis would be that DX does have a recollection but is deliberately not telling the truth. A third basis for rejecting DX was that DX was in effect deceiving himself as to what had actually happened between him and his nieces. 

24. In his crossexamination Mr Barr asked questions about the two documents which I referred to which DX had given to the police. Exhibit F was the first document in time which DX had created. Some weeks later he created the second document which became exhibit E and he acknowledged that he had put more thought into the second document which should be more accurate. However, it appeared in cross-examination that some of the things which were contained in the second document were, according to DX, not true. Specifically he was asked about the masturbation in the bedroom occurring after the car incident and an assertion in the later document that effectively in the bedroom he had asked CY to hold his penis. He acknowledged that. My note is to the effect that DX said that is what I wrote but that is not what it means, I did not ask her to hold it in the bedroom. He acknowledged that what he had written in the second document never happened. Asked why he wrote it he said he was "" pretty confused "". It was hard to remember. He agreed that he now says that that document was wrong. 

25. When he was interviewed by the police, which was after he had provided both documents to them and occurred on 10 March last year, he was asked whether he was "" aware if the penis actually went into her mouth "" referring to the incident with CY in the car. His answer was, "" It, it could have, I don't know, I really don't know "". Asked a little later whether his penis went into her mouth his response was, "" I, I'm not, I, I'd say, I'm not sure, I'm really not sure, you know"". Asked whether CY had sucked his penis he did say a little later, ""No, not, no, not what I can remember, no "", and went on to add, "" No, I'm not saying that's not true, I, I try, I try to remember every detail "". He did make it clear that he denied masturbating in the bedroom. 

26. When he was cross-examined by Mr Barr he was asked about one of the answers I have just quoted - to the effect that, "" I'm not saying that that's not true "" - and part of his answer was, "" That's how I think now too "". A little further on he said, "" I'm not saying it's not true "". 

27. DX also acknowledged in cross-examination that his memory was very sparse and that it was faded and that it was some twenty-five years since the events occurred and he was trying to remember. He did say that he felt lousy and uncomfortable during his interview. I saw the interview. He did ask for some water at some stage but he did appear to me to be concentrating and giving attempts to give articulate answers. 

28. The basis for Mr Barr's submission about DX deceiving himself, this series of questions and answers at T106 to 107: 
"" Q. You see, what I'm suggesting to you is that because of what you did, you've tried to put all of this behind you, and you just don't remember what happened at the time? 
A. I remember what happened at the time. 

Q. Alternatively I'm suggesting that you're deceiving yourself about what actually happened? 
A. This could be true. 

Q. Because what you did, even on your own evidence, is a terrible thing to do? 
A. That's right. 

Q. And something that you would be ashamed of? 
A. I was. 

Q. And something that I suppose you could hardly believe that you did it? 
A. That's true "". 

When Mr Barr went on to suggest that he had talked himself into a version of events DX said that the version he wrote in his statement was as he remembered it. Asked more directly whether he was in effect deceiving himself about what had actually happened he said that he did not "" set out to do that "". 

29. I do not regard DX as telling lies. However I have grave reservations about his recollection and I think it likely that he is deceiving himself. The matters which I have referred to so far as the inconsistencies are between his statements and what he says occurred now; his acknowledgments of assertions by the complainants that could be true; his faded memory and his acknowledgment of self deception to my mind combine to render his evidence on these specific issues completely unreliable. 

30. I do not accept his evidence for those reasons. I do not regard there being a reasonable possibility that his recollection on those specific accounts could be true. I therefore am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accounts given by CY and SZ are true.

		25 August 2011",2011-07-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757423,State of NSW v Robert Ellmore [2011] NSWSC 837,"Judgment  1By amended summons filed on 21 July 2011, the State of New South Wales applied for an extended supervision order for a period of three years in respect of the defendant pursuant to Part 2 of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act).  On the same day I made the orders set out in the schedule to the amended summons.  These are my reasons for so doing.  2On 13 April 2011 the proceedings, which were originally commenced by summons filed 18 March 2011, came before Justice Harrison.  Justice Harrison made orders for interim supervision which were further extended by Acting Justice Grove on 17 May 2011.  Justice Adams extended those orders on 17 June 2011 and a further extension of the orders was effected by Justice Schmidt on 15 July 2011.  3The defendant made no objection to the interim orders, nor does the defendant make any substantive objection to the final orders, subject to what appears below in relation to orders 34, 35 and 36.  Notwithstanding the defendant's consent to the making of final orders, the Court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if not kept under supervision : s 9(2).  In reaching this level of satisfaction, the Court must have regard to the matters set out in s 9 (3) of the Act.  4The defendant's criminal history (s 9(3)(h)) commences in 1958 and is comprised predominantly of sexual offences committed against female children between the ages of five and 12 years.  In 1958 when the defendant was about 20 years of age he indecently assaulted a female aged 10 and received a sentence of one month imprisonment.  In August 1976 when the defendant was 38 years of age he indecently assaulted a 6 year old and an 8 year old female and received a term of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year.  There was a further indecent assault on a female taken into account on a Form One.  5In January 1981 when the defendant was 43 years of age he committed an act of indecency on a 10 year old child and received a sentence of 15 months imprisonment.  In September 1984 when the defendant was 46 years of age he indecently assaulted a 12 year old child and received a fixed term of three years imprisonment.  In November 1991 when the defendant was 54 years of age he was convicted of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a five year old child and received a good behaviour bond for a period of five years.  6In early 2001 when the defendant was 63 years of age he committed a number of aggravated indecent assaults on an eight year old child and received a sentence of seven years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years and eight months.  That sentence expired on 23 April 2011.  7At the time that the last sentence was imposed on the defendant, the sentencing judge regarded the defendant's objective criminality as approaching ""the highest order"".  It was noted that the defendant was on parole at the time of the commission of the offences.  The sentencing judge also recommended that the defendant participate in the CUBIT program and that on release to parole he be required to participate in the community maintenance program.  8All of the offences involved non-penetrative touching of the genitalia and breasts, kissing and simulated sexual intercourse.  The offences constitute serious sex offences as defined by the Act.  Moreover, some of them were committed while the defendant was, or was posing as, an Anglican priest and therefore involved gross breaches of trust.  9Two psychiatrists, namely Dr Anthony Samuels and Dr Andrew Ellis, were appointed by the Court pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act to examine the defendant and provide reports.  Dr Samuels' report is now exhibit A in these proceedings.  Dr Ellis's report is exhibit B.  Section 9(3)(b) mandates the Court to have regard to these reports.  10Dr Samuels found the defendant to display ""an astounding level of denial, rationalisation and intellectualisation in regard to his offending history.""  The defendant persistently denied the majority of his offences and when challenged about apparent inconsistencies the defendant ""blithely but politely dismissed these challenges.""  The defendant was inconsistent in his interview with Dr Samuels, initially describing a ""skirmish"" with his six-year-old niece, whom he said took her clothes off and was being inappropriate with him, albeit later acknowledging that he was sexually attracted to her.  The only offence for which the defendant would take responsibility, although he claimed to have no memory of it, was one he committed, on his account, under the influence of alcohol.  11The defendant's explanation for pleading guilty on the majority of occasions that he was charged, and his explanation for undertaking treatment, attending groups and taking anti-libidinal medication, was that he persistently got bad legal advice and was misled by his solicitors.  12Dr Samuels was of the view that the defendant displayed ""distorted attitudes towards women and his victims"".  Dr Samuels notes that ""the level of denial, his frank, rather unguarded disclosures given the context and apparent inability to appreciate the inconsistencies in his presentation, [raised] the possibility of an underlying neurocognitive disorder.  Against this is the fact that he is articulate, has no word finding difficulties, is able to remember dates and places, coherently give time sequences and his IQ seems to be relatively preserved"".  In summary, Dr Samuels was of the view that the defendant had quite ""significant antisocial and narcissistic personality features.""  13Dr Samuels' major concern in relation to the defendant's interaction with others in the community is that when the defendant encounters vulnerable people, ""particularly young women with children"", they ""may be predisposed by religious beliefs or the context in which [the defendant] encounters them"", to feel sympathetically disposed towards him as a former ""man of the cloth"" and accept that he has been subjected to ""miscarriages of justice and unfortunate events"".  14Dr Samuels found no evidence that the defendant's offending behaviour was in any way connected with substance abuse.  The defendant appeared to have made limited gains from psychological treatment and was willing to continue therapy and medication.  To the extent that the defendant benefited from anti-libidinal medication in the past, Dr Samuels noted that all of the offences were constituted by touching and that the ability to maintain an erection therefore does not preclude the defendant from committing further offences of that nature.  15Dr Samuels is of the opinion that the defendant's score of 4 on the STATIC-99R placed him in the moderate to high risk category, but that such a score significantly underrates his risk of re-offending.  The score reflects a three point subtraction on account of the defendant's age, but Dr Samuels doubted that this subtraction was justified, given the defendant's presentation as a ""reasonably robust man for his age"", whose offending behaviour was ""not necessarily likely to diminish because of age related factors.""  16The defendant's criminal history disclosed ""persistent sexual violence involving psychological coercion"" and ""a chronic pattern of behaviour"".  The defendant was said to exhibit ""extreme minimisation, denial, attitudes that support or condone sexual violence, ... problems with self awareness and ... problems resulting from child abuse.""  17Dr Samuels diagnosed the defendant as a sexual deviant with social adjustment problems including problems with intimate and non-intimate relationships, problems with employment and problems with treatment and supervision.  Dr Samuels noted that the defendant ""has had quite intensive psychological treatment but the benefits of this treatment are questionable.  He does seem to have had some benefit from anti-androgen type medication but is now expressing some reservations about using it at the current dose in the long term.""  18Taking into account all of these factors, Dr Samuels regards the defendant as being at high risk of committing further serious sex offences if not kept under supervision.  19Dr Ellis identified a number of factors that are most consistently or prominently associated with the risk of sexual re-offending.  According to those factors, the defendant presented with ""a clear pattern of paraphilic sexual arousal, heterosexual paedophilia"".  In the defendant's case, deviant sexual arousal would continue despite age.  The defendant ""showed poor understanding of the effect of sexual arousal on offending behaviour.""  20Whilst the defendant did not present with an antisocial personality disorder, he does present with personality dysfunction, including narcissistic and schizoptypal personality traits.  21Dr Ellis noted that the defendant's completion of group sex offender treatment programs was not without difficulty and that his ""treatment progress did not demonstrate significant changes in attitudes"".  The defendant ""continued to display significant use of distortion, denial and disavowal of personal responsibility for offences, and attitudes towards victims supportive of further offending"".  The defendant's inflexible thoughts and attitudes were thought to be ""likely to contribute to ongoing risk by influencing behaviour in at risk situations and by interfering with treatment progress"".  22The defendant also expressed to Dr Ellis a desire to lower his current dose of anti-libidinal medication.  23Dr Samuels in the course of his report referred extensively to a report prepared by Mr Brabant on 28 January 2011.  Mr Brabant, Professor Greenberg and Dr Patfield each assessed the defendant in terms of his risk of re-offending.  These reports are relevant for the purposes of s 9(3)(c) of the Act.  24Mr Brabant's assessment of the likelihood that the defendant would commit a further serious sexual offence is consistent with that reached by Dr Samuel.  Mr Brabant considered that the defendant has an ""intense, enduring and recurrent sexual interest towards prepubescent females"".  It was noted that the defendant had difficulty acknowledging his level of risk, that he engaged in behaviour that placed him at a higher risk of re-offending and that the defendant expressed ""extreme minimisation and denial of his offending behaviour, has difficulty with self awareness, [and] holds sexual offence supportive attitudes.""  The defendant displays distorted beliefs about his sexual offending, including the belief that children are sexually provocative and seek out and enjoy sex.  25Mr Brabant also noted that the defendant's response to treatment was less than ideal and that he begrudged the level of supervision to which he is subject.  Notwithstanding that the defendant said he had no current sexual interest, including arousal in the presence of children, Mr Brabant indicated that the defendant was at risk of re-offending unless he was properly managed through medication.  26Mr Brabant's overall assessment of the defendant's risk of re-offending was in the high risk category relative to other adult male sexual offenders.  27Professor Greenberg prepared a report on 2 May 2008 at the request of the New South Wales State Parole Authority.  His diagnosis was that the defendant had a paedophilia disorder and that the defendant would benefit from long-term treatment with anti-libidinal medication.  Professor Greenberg thought that the defendant required monitoring by a psychiatrist with expertise in treating sexual offenders on anti-libidinal medication.  28Professor Greenberg's view was that in the short to medium-term, the defendant's risk of re-offending would ""probably be substantially increased if he were to discontinue the medication.""  29Dr Patfield prepared a report on 24 February 2010 again at the request of the State Parole Authority.  Dr Patfield noted that the defendant saw himself as a passive participant in the circumstances leading up to his offending.  Furthermore, the defendant did not demonstrate ""any ability to respect the normal inter-personal boundaries"" so that any release plan should restrict the defendant from interacting with minors.  Dr Patfield's view was that the principal tools for risk reduction were social and biological rather than psychological.  Dr Patfield identified anti-libidinal medication and psycho therapeutic treatment as potentially beneficial to reduce the defendant's risk of re-offending.  30The statistical assessments carried out for the purposes of s 9(3)(d) of the Act used the Static-99 actuarial tool.  31On 26 July 2001 Dr Lennings assessed the defendant using this tool and found his risk of re-offending to be moderately high.  At that time, Dr Lennings thought there was a strong possibility of future sexual offending.  32Jason Borkowski in his report of 28 October 2005 assessed the defendant in the high risk category for sexual and violent recidivism relative to other adult male sexual offenders.  33Mr Brabant in his report of 28 January 2011 referred to an assessment using the statistical tool carried out on 20 January 2011, which placed the defendant in the moderate high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders.  34In Mr Brabant's opinion, the difference between the score on the Static-99 in January 2011 and the score in 2005 noted by Mr Borkowski was partly attributable to a recent revision of the statistical tool that takes into account reductions in offending that are commonly observed as offenders age.  For this reason, offenders above the age of 60 received a three point subtraction from the score that they receive on testing.  35The subtraction of the three points from the defendant's score should be seen in the light of the fact that the defendant was 63 years of age when he committed his most recent offences.  This point has also been made by Dr Samuels in the course of his report.  36Dr Ellis in his report explained that the assessment performed under Static-99 takes into account the low rates of sexual recidivism for persons over the age of 60.  However, Dr Ellis's view is that the defendant has yet to demonstrate that there has been a decrease in these factors in his own case, albeit recognizing that the defendant has not had an opportunity to demonstrate such a decrease because he was until recently in custody.  Dr Ellis found that there was some evidence that the defendant's sex drive and general behaviour has improved.  37Turning to the defendant's level of compliance with obligations whilst on parole (s 9(3)(f)), it is noted that the defendant was released to parole on 12 December 2000 and complied with his obligations to contact Probation and Parole and undergo monthly counselling.  However, prior to the completion of his parole, the defendant was arrested on 24 April 2001 for further sexual offences.  The offences were committed in March 2001 whilst the defendant was on parole for sentences imposed at Liverpool District Court in 1999.  38The defendant was last released to parole on 23 December 2010.  The defendant has complied with supervising staff and has engaged with the services offered at the residential facility where he now lives.  39The defendant's participation in treatment programmes (s 9(3)(e)) is less than encouraging.  The defendant completed a sex offender program in April 2000, consisting of eight sessions.  The defendant was noted to have a ""tendency to take the high moral ground on issues pertaining to sex with young persons"".  40The defendant commenced on the high-intensity CUBIT program on 11 October 2004 and completed it in September 2005.  The final treatment report noted that the defendant had disclosed the majority of the offences for which he had been convicted.  It was also noted that the defendant disclosed during the course of the program a range of inappropriate and sexually abusive behaviours in the past.  The clinical psychologist's report noted that the defendant demonstrated poor empathy towards his victims and that his deviant sexual arousal to prepubescent and pubescent girls, his cognitive distortion relating to his sexual offending behaviour, his externalisation of responsibility for his sexual offending and his manipulation of others all required further attention.  41In a supplementary report of the 28th of October 2005 Mr Borkowski identified the same issues as the clinical psychologist.  Mr Borkowski noted that the defendant insisted that he had been misunderstood and that he presented as a ""martyr"", possibly in order to gain sympathy from therapists and other group members.  Mr Borkowski identified these patterns of behaviour as manipulative and consistent with the tactics used by the defendant to facilitate his offending.  42In the final weeks of treatment, the defendant stated that he was ""not prepared to change certain things"".  He claimed that he was ""too old to learn"", that he was misunderstood and that he was entitled to ""keep the Church beliefs"", whilst reluctant to disclose and discuss his sexual deviancy.  43The defendant lacked insight into how he would manage his potential risk factors when released into the community.  The defendant's relapse prevention plans were considered superficial and his strategies to minimise re-offending were thought to be inappropriate.  44After completion of the CUBIT program, the defendant disclosed to another inmate that he would be able to maintain his role of deacon in the Anglican Church.  However on 23 October 2001, the defendant was deposed from holy orders.  Mr Borkowski described this disclosure to an inmate as ""worrying"", because the defendant had used his associations with the Church in the past to gain access to victims.  45The defendant commenced the Maintenance Program in May 2006.  The psychologist noted that the defendant developed more strategies for dealing with his risk factors and that following release into the community, the defendant would require continued monitoring and support, including regular contact with a psychiatrist to monitor his response to medication and provide a comprehensive treatment plan for sexual deviance.  The psychologist concluded that under no circumstances should the defendant have unsupervised contact with children.  46The defendant's experience with anti-libidinal medication commenced in October 1992.  However in December 1993, the defendant ceased using the drug because he felt he had sufficient control over his sexual drive.  47The defendant was prescribed antidepressant medication in January 1999.  He ceased this medication between December 1999 and December 2000.  In April 2001, the defendant again requested anti-libidinal medication which he continues to take.  It has already been noted that the defendant has expressed the desire to cease anti-libidinal medication and that it is unlikely that the defendant would continue to take it, unless it was a condition of his parole.  This is of particular concern given the opinions of Dr Samuels and Dr Ellis to the effect that anti-libidinal medication appears to have been the only treatment that has some measurable effect on the defendant's paraphilia.  48A report dated 14 March 2011 sets out the terms of the defendant's supervision and case management by the Community Compliance and Monitoring Group (CCMG) : s 9(3)(d1) of the Act.  49The defendant presently lives at the Community Offenders Support Programme (COSP) and receives budgeting, job-seeking and private accommodation assistance.  The accommodation provides the defendant with a structured environment to assist with his gradual reintegration into the community.  50The defendant is electronically monitored, which ensures he does not go into areas that are prohibited and that he keeps appointments with his service providers.  He must provide a schedule of his proposed movements one week in advance.  51The defendant also participates in the Maintenance Program at Forensic Psychological Services on a weekly basis.  The current risk management plan is to be extended to incorporate the conditions of an extended supervision order.  52There has been no complaint regarding the defendant's compliance with his reporting obligations since he has been in the community and subject to the obligations imposed under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 : see s 9(3)(g) of the Act.  53Section 9(3)(a) of the Act requires the court to have regard to the safety of the community.  Taking into account the preceding matters, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of re-offending without supervision and that an extended supervision order is warranted in order to protect the community, more specifically young girls between the ages of five and 12 years.  In summary, the defendant has an extensive record for committing serious sexual offences against girls in that age group, he has been diagnosed with paedophilia, he has been assessed as at a high risk of re-offending without supervision, he has committed sexual offences against children whilst on parole and he has failed to demonstrate any insight, despite his participation in sex offender treatment.  The defendant continues to engage in minimisation and denial of his offending behaviour.  The defendant has also displayed a reluctance to acknowledge his level of risk, particularly when one has regard to the defendant's attempts to re-engage with the Church and his ambivalent attitude towards anti-libidinal medication.  54It is in the context of these factors that the defendant's objection to conditions 34, 35 and 36 of the supervision order must be assessed.  Those conditions relate to the powers of the supervising officer to search the defendant and/or his premises and seize any item where the supervising officer reasonably believes that the search is necessary for the safety and welfare of the residents at the defendant's accommodation, or to monitor the defendant's compliance with a supervision order or because the supervising officer reasonably suspects that the defendant is engaging in behaviour associated with an increased risk of re-offending.  55The defendant maintains that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that these conditions are necessary, given that they were not part of the interim order and there has been no material change in the defendant's circumstances.  Furthermore, it is submitted that, in the absence of a specific provision in the Act directed to such conditions, there is no basis for subjecting the defendant to them, particularly where they infringe his fundamental rights. As to the last of these objections, the whole of the extended supervision order subject the defendant to such a close level of supervision that the imposition of search and seizure conditions can only minimally add to the infringement of the defendant's rights represented by the order.  56Section 11 of the Act provides that an extended supervision order may direct an offender to comply with such conditions as the Court considers appropriate.  The section goes on to enumerate twelve non exclusive directions that may be imposed upon an offender.  Clearly, the Court has the power to impose a search and seizure condition, if it is appropriate to the circumstances of the individual case.  57The material upon which the plaintiff relies to justify a search and seizure condition arises out of the report of Dr Ellis.  Dr Ellis notes that the defendant expressed some disappointment when he was told he was not allowed to make contact with an acquaintance in New Zealand who had also been convicted of sex offences.  Obviously, the defendant's contact with other offenders constitutes a dynamic risk factor.  The defendant's supervising officers would therefore have a legitimate interest in detecting any correspondence that the defendant might have with other offenders.  58I am satisfied that conditions 34, 35 and 36 are justified in the circumstances referred to above.  59The court-appointed experts differ with respect to the length of the extended supervision order.  Dr Ellis is of the view that a period of five years would be required to establish the defendant in the community and further refine the appraisal of risk.  Dr Samuels is of the view that a period of three years is necessary.  60The plaintiff's submission is that an extended supervision order for a period of three years meets the circumstances of the defendant's case.   The order includes a level of flexibility which will enable certain conditions to be reviewed at periodic intervals.  Given the nature of conditions 34, 35 and 36, it is appropriate in my view that the order be restricted to a period of three years.  Those conditions grant significant powers to departmental officers.  The exercise of those powers should not be available for a longer period than is necessary to demonstrate any breaches or potential breaches of the supervision order.  **********

		04 August 2011",2011-07-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757431,R v ADOLPH VARGAS [2011] NSWDC 89,"SENTENCE 


1HIS HONOUR: Paul Andres Adolph Vargas arrived in Australia on 11 February this year. He was selected by customs officers for more detailed scrutiny than is usually given to incoming passengers. An ion scan of a suitcase carried by the offender revealed a positive reading for the presence of cocaine. Customs officers therefore had a conversation with the offender in which he said a number of things, concluding with an admission that he was carrying internally about eighty pellets of cocaine. 

2Police were called. Over that day and the following days the offender passed a large number of pellets containing cocaine. There were in fact seventy-eight such objects concealed within the offender's body. The total gross weight of the powder was 921 grams, it was fairly pure too, 85.3 per cent so that the net weight was 789 grams. 

3The offender is thirty-one years of age. He was born in Peru, his father was German. His parents separated, his father returning to Germany eventually, and the offender has lived with his mother and father at various times and in various locations: He lived with his mother in Brazil; His father in Peru; His mother in the United States of America; and his father in Germany at various times of his life. 

4It was whilst in Germany where he was living on unemployment benefits that the offender first became involved in the scheme which would see him ultimately coming to Australia with cocaine inside him. He did not like Germany, he did not like the climate and he felt isolated. He therefore wanted to return to Peru. Someone that he was associating with in Germany suggested that if he agreed to travel to Australia via Argentina with drugs inside him then he could both have his travel paid for and earn a bit of money. That particular importation did not eventuate but eventually the offender, who had travelled to Peru anyway, took steps over a number of days to facilitate his attempted importation of the drug into Australia. 

5He first was taken to a room where he practised by swallowing carrots and eventually he was taken to a location where he was provided with the drug. He has swallowed as many pellets as he could. He had to stop before he was able to swallow all of the drugs that were made available to him. 

6The offender has had some periods of employment and, as I mentioned before, he was largely unemployed in Germany. When he returned to Peru he worked as a salesperson for a while but it would seem that his substance abuse, which had commenced at the age of fifteen, had significant affects upon his behaviour and cognitive functioning. 

7After his arrest he offered to assist the authorities. The value of that assistance has been assessed as ""low to nil"" but his behaviour virtually from the moment he was selected by customs for closer scrutiny has been consistent with the willingness to facilitate the course of justice even though his assistance in terms of identifying other offenders has been of very limited value. I will impose upon the offender a sentence which is approximately thirty per cent less than it would otherwise have been to reflect his plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities. 

8The offender has suffered from mental health problems for some time, although it would seem at least some of those are due to his drug use. Nevertheless there is evidence to suggest that he was depressed before he committed this offence. Things have certainly got a lot worse for him since he went into custody, but his depression does appear to predate the commission of this offence and that condition appears to be related to the difficulty he has adjusting to novel environments as he moves from country to country and parent to parent. 

9He told the psychologist that he had hit rock bottom, saying, ""you cannot go down from here"". Upon the offender's release from custody it is difficult to know whether he will be able to easily put his drug using ways behind him. If he does not, there is a risk that he will continue to commit offences of some kind. 

10I note that, not surprisingly, the offender has had no previous convictions for drug supply or importation matters. I say ""not surprisingly"" because it is notorious that drug couriers without criminal histories are invariably chosen precisely because that reduces the chances that they will be identified as in fact being drug couriers. The offender will of course serve his sentence away from family support and away from his friends as well. Fortunately for him he speaks English well, as well as a number of other languages and so will not have the problems with communication that often come about where an offender serves a sentence in a foreign country. 

11But it is the case that he will be isolated from family and friends and in no position to receive visits, at least none of any regularity. Not too much can be made of this because it was the offender's choice to travel to a foreign country and attempt to break its laws. In that sense, the offender has only himself to blame for his present predicament. But I do take into account that he will serve his sentence harder than others who are not as isolated as the offender is from family and friends. 

12This is of course a serious offence. The maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment is testament to that, as are other sentences imposed on others who attempt to import significant quantities of border controlled drugs. There is easy money to be made from acting like the offender tried to do and there seems to be an almost limitless supply of people like the offender willing to risk their liberty for financial gain. It is therefore incumbent upon the courts to impose sentences on those who would import drugs into Australia which would have the affect of deterring others who may be tempted to act as the offender has. 

13Both the Crown and Ms Bagot who appeared for the offender relied on other cases which were said to be comparable. They were of significant assistance to me. Of course no two cases are alike and, in particular, some cases concerned a different sort of drug, heroin, and others concerned different quantities. 

14I noted in the course of discussions with the lawyers, the apparent difference between the way State law treats similar quantities of heroin and cocaine and Commonwealth law treats similar quantities of those two drugs. When one looks therefore at a case involving heroin of a particular quantity, it cannot be concluded that under Commonwealth law the same sentence would have been imposed for the identical quantity of cocaine. Also, many of the cases relied on by Ms Bagot concerned quantities of cocaine different from the amount that this offender tried to import. 

15I should say this, in many cases the quantity of drug imported by a courier is beyond their control. They often import as much as they can and as the particular method of concealment would allow. This case is a good example where the offender stopped swallowing the pellets after he could swallow no more. So the quantity of a drug that an offender imports is in many cases beyond his or her control. Despite that, it remains undeniable that it is worse to import a larger quantity of drug than a smaller quantity of drug. 

16Ms Bagot very helpfully summarised the cases on which she wished to rely in a table. It sets out in easily understandable form and on a single page a great deal of information concerning those other cases. As it turns out, and entirely coincidentally, the two cases which concern cocaine of about the same quantity of drugs that are the subject of this case involve offenders who I sentenced, one in 2007 and one in 2008. As the table reveals those two offenders had remarkably similar cases and it is at least pleasing to me to note that I imposed identical sentences on those largely similar offenders. 

17Not surprisingly I have used those sentences as a significant guide to the sentence that I should impose upon this offender, noting that in neither of these two cases I am referring to was there an appeal from either side. 

18It is always a terribly sad thing to sentence someone to gaol for a significant period of time, but it is necessary to do so to protect the Australian community. No-one gets any pleasure from seeing an offender such as the present spending a significant time in custody, wasting his life in gaol, but it is necessary to do so in order that the Courts play their part in reducing the quantity of drugs which comes into this country. 

19The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four years to date from 11 February 2011 and a head sentence of seven years. The non-parole period will expire on 10 February 2015. Although I stated the non-parole period first and perhaps for Commonwealth law I should have stated the head sentence first, it makes no difference to the ultimate outcome. 

20Mr Adolph Vargas do you understand what I have just done? 

21OFFENDER: Yes your Honour. 

22HIS HONOUR: Let me just make sure. Your sentence started the day you were arrested at Sydney airport and it goes for four years which you must serve in prison. That means that on 10 February 2015 four years after your arrest you are entitled to be released from custody. Although you will probably be deported immediately, you are still serving the sentence for another three years it is just that you will not be in custody. It probably does not have any affect upon you, so all you really need to know is that for four years from 11 February, 2011 you will be held in custody and then released. Do you understand sir? 

23OFFENDER: Yes.

		11 August 2011",2011-07-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757436,R v RAULINAITIS [2011] NSWDC 88,"SENTENCE 




1HIS HONOUR: The offender arrived in Australia on 8 May 2010 travelling from Abu Dhabi. He was travelling on a Lithuanian passport. He was searched and during that examination Customs officers discovered two quantities of what turned out to be heroin concealed in an attach case that the offender was carrying. He was charged and declined the opportunity to be interviewed by police. 

2Upon examination the Australian Federal Police found two separate concealments, one weighing 714 grams the other 736 grams. When calculations were made for the purity of the heroin involved the total weight of pure heroin that was imported by the offender was 628 grams. The offender has of course been in custody since that date. 

3He pleaded guilty to this offence, not at an early stage but about one month before his matter was listed for trial. In those circumstances I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon him by about fifteen per cent to reflect his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. 

4What I know of the offender's background is to be found in a psychological report prepared by a psychologist on behalf of the offender. Of course I can only assume that what he told the psychologist is true, but there was no challenge to any aspect of it and so I will proceed on the basis that the history that the offender gave to the psychologist is accurate. What it reveals is a man born in a small village in Lithuania who has experienced terrible tragedy over his life. Almost every member of his family it would seem has died in tragic circumstances. Suicide, fire and, accident, have all taken the lives of the offender's loved ones. His marital history has also been a sad one. The offender was married but got divorced. His second marriage was in trouble at the time that he decided to come to Australia, and that relationship appears now to have broken down with his wife not answering any communications from him. 

5The offender's main occupation whilst in Lithuania seems to have been drinking, especially in the time leading up to the commission of this offence. As he told the psychologist, after he and his second wife separated in 2010 he would get drunk, go to sleep, wake up and drink again. The psychologist expresses the view that the offender has not been coping with his grief well. 

6He is now incarcerated in an institution where he is effectively in solitary confinement because of his inability to speak English and the lack of anyone who speaks Lithuanian. Although the offender does also have a reasonable grasp of both Russian and Polish it appears that his difficulties in finding other Lithuanian, Russian, or Polish speaking inmates has led to a feeling of intense isolation. Of course not too much can be made of this, after all it was the offender's decision to commit a crime in Australia where he would be isolated from people back in Lithuania. But I do have to take into account the circumstances in which the offender will serve his sentence of imprisonment, and he will do his time in custody much harder than would otherwise be the case because of the isolation caused by his difficulties in communication. 

7Those difficulties also lead to another consequence which will make his time in custody harder. The offender is physically unwell and he has difficulty communicating problems and symptoms to medical staff. 

8Quite how it is that the offender became involved in this offence is impossible to determine. The offender put no evidence before me to explain how that has come about and he refused to speak to police when he was arrested. So what led to him deciding to commit this most serious offence I simply do not know. 

9Mr Townsend pointed out that the psychologist reported that the offender had told her that he was drinking enormous quantities at the time and was therefore vulnerable. But it is a pure guess to say that, even if he was vulnerable, this vulnerability had anything to do with the commission of this offence. 

10Really, the most that can be said in the offender's favour is that he is a courier rather than a principal. Even that is not something that is a matter that is beyond doubt. True it is that the offender was acting as a courier when he was detected by police but it does not necessarily follow that he was not also performing another role higher up in the drug importation hierarchy. Nevertheless it seems to be accepted by the Crown that the offender was a mere courier and I will sentence him on that basis. 

11This offence is of course a very serious matter. The community suffers enormously from the actions of drug addicts who feed their addiction often by the commission of criminal offences. The close relationship between property crimes and the availability of heroin has been identified in particular by the work of the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. And of course individual addicts suffer as well, many productive lives are ruined by heroin use and what would otherwise be a worthwhile citizen is reduced to a person who measures out his or her life in court dates. It is for this reason that general deterrence is of fundamental importance in drug importation offences. 

12The offender has no prior convictions in Australia and only offences for dishonesty matters in Lithuania. Whilst he is entitled to me take into account that this is his first offence involving drugs it would have been better for the offender if I had been able to relate his character in some way to the circumstances which led to him committing this offence. As I have repeatedly said, I simply do not know what led to him turning up in Australia with an attach case containing a substantial quantity of an illegal and dangerous drug. 

13Despite the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Youssef v R [ 2011] NSWCCA 104 the Crown relied on the Court of Criminal Appeal decision in Wong and Leung v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 and despite the High Court decision of Hili and Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 Mr Townsend relied on sentencing statistics. The Crown also relied on what it said were three comparative cases indicating the length of sentences that have been imposed in this court for broadly similar offences, one of those being a sentence I imposed myself. I will take those sentences into account as well as of course the fact that this offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment, indicating that anyone convicted of an offence of this kind must expect to spend a lengthy period of time in custody. 
 
14The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for seven and a half years. I set a non-parole period of four and a half years. The sentence is to date from 8 May 2010, which means that the offender will be released to parole on 7 November 2014. 

15Mr Raulinaitis your sentence has started on 8 May 2010, that is the day you were arrested at Sydney airport. You will remain in custody until 7 November 2014. That is, you will be in custody for four and a half years. You will be released from custody on that day, 7 November 2014, and although you will probably be deported immediately your sentence will continue for another three years after that, even though you are not actually in custody.

2757450,R v AYOUB [2011] NSWDC 133,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Appearing for sentence today is Joseph Ayoub. He has pleaded guilty to an offence of using a carriage service to procure a person under sixteen years of age for sexual activity. When I sentence him for that matter he asks that I take into account, under s 16B(a) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act , a closely related offence of using a carriage service to transmit indecent communications to a person under the age of sixteen. I say closely related because these indecent communications were transmitted as part of the offender's activity in committing the first offence. 

2Things all started on Wednesday 11 August 2010. There was a young boy fourteen years of age getting the bus home from school. He had apparently been on detention. The offender was also on the bus. He sat down next to the boy and started to speak to him. The offender asked the boy for his phone number. The boy said he did not know it but the offender got the boy to send him a text message which revealed the number from which the text message was sent. The offender said ""now I have got your number"" and he got off the bus. Later that evening the fourteen year old boy received three text messages from the offender, asking him to meet him. Fortunately the young boy must have spoken to his parents or at least someone in authority because the child exploitation internet unit of the police became involved. They were able to identify the offender and communications then took place between a member of the police force and the offender. The member of the police force was posing as the fourteen year old boy. It is important to note that the first communication with the offender on 18 August was a communication from the police to the offender. It is entirely possible perhaps that were it not for that communication these offences would not have been committed. The communications which did ensue involved voice communication, SMS and sending of multi media messages. In those messages the police officer, assuming the identity of the fourteen year old boy, makes it clear that the offender is communicating with a fourteen year old boy. Despite that, the offender makes highly indecent suggestions to what he thinks is a fourteen year old boy; sends photographs and videos of himself and perhaps most importantly seeks to meet this boy. He says that he wants to meet the boy, they could go to the movies where the offender could take him into the toilets and suck him off. They even talk about the time that this would occur, the offender saying: ""What about next Wednesday""?; that he could say to his mother that he was an old friend from school; and he was going to stay over with this friend after the movies. 

3I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did intend to meet the young boy. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that if that had occurred the offender would have attempted to engage in sexual activity with that boy. All of those communications occurred on the evening of Wednesday 18 August. 

4On Monday 23 August, again posing as the young boy, the officer sent two further text messages to the offender but no response was received. At lunch time that day the offender was arrested. 

5As far as the seriousness of the offences is concerned there are of course factors which point both ways. In favour of the offender is the fact that the first communication on 18 August came from police, but working against him of course is the circumstance that this is not a case where the offender simply obtained sexual gratification through his communications with what he thought was a fourteen year old boy. He, as I have said earlier, did intend to meet him. Fortunately there was no fourteen year old boy involved, (apart from the one who the offender met on the bus) and so the actual harm caused by the offender's conduct is significantly minimised because of that. But the offence does demonstrate the dangers which are posed by people such as the offender who use telephones and other forms of communication to procure young people for sexual activity. 

6The offender has some significant problems, indeed he could not even understand the caution that investigators offered to him upon his arrest. They therefore did not interview him, a completely appropriate decision in the absence of the offender understanding what they had said to him. The offender is a person who has been diagnosed as suffering from schizoaffective disorder; an illness characterised by delusional hallucinations, disorder of thought form, difficulty processing information and bizarre behaviour. The offender has been treated over the years and supervised by Probation and Parole Service on many occasions but not much has been achieved. For example, Dr Kavanagh of the Croydon Mental Health Service has been treating the offender's mental health issues in the community since 2007 but the Probation and Parole pre-sentence report reveals that the offender's continued engagement with their Service would be futile due to the offender's historically poor response. Similarly the offender has responded poorly to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and indeed he was on a s 9 bond at the time of these offences. 

7The offender not only suffers from the mental illness that I have mentioned but he is also developmentally delayed. He appears to have gone to a special school. His mother and father appear to suffer similar issues. 

8The offender's criminal history was put before me. As I mentioned to the Crown at the time, it is difficult to tease out of the lengthy document that I was given offences that the offender has committed, given that within the document there are a number of references to matters that had been dismissed or withdrawn. But there does not appear to have been any offence involving sexual assault for example on the offender's criminal history, although there was a matter where the offender has used a carriage service to commit an offence, those matters apparently having been dealt with under various mental health provisions. 

9It is clear that a sentence with a substantial component of general deterrence should not be imposed upon the offender because of his psychiatric conditions. But as Mr Webb, who appears for the offender, acknowledged, personal deterrence remains of fundamental importance. The problem is that efforts to date would suggest that Mr Ayoub is a person who is difficult to deter. That does not mean that courts simply give up. What it does mean is that the courts must fashion orders with some precision and care in order to ensure that the offender knows that he has done the wrong thing, knows that he will be punished if he does it again and knows also that he will be punished if he does not comply with orders designed to reduce the prospect of him committing further offences. 

10Mr Webb submits that these offences appear to have been committed while the offender was using drugs and that therefore if orders can be fashioned to reduce the prospect of the offender using drugs it is unlikely that offences of this kind will be repeated. The Crown makes the submission that the offender did not give evidence and therefore there is no sworn evidence that the offender was using drugs at the time of the offence. I note, however, that the offender told Dr Furst of his drug use, saying that he was pretty high at the time. The offender is not a sophisticated person who would be able to reason that by telling Dr Furst he was using drugs it may in some way be better for him. I accept therefore that the offender was using drugs at the time of this offence and that together with his mental issues meant that he was less able to respond appropriately to impulses which he felt. 

11All sentencing is difficult but some sentence matters are harder than others. Many of the harder sentencing exercises involve mentally ill offenders who present some danger to the community. I hold out very little hope that the offender will be able to put his criminal ways behind him, although, given his criminal history to date, the chances are good that offending of this particular kind will not be repeated. 

12Mr Webb submitted that the offender's time in custody to date, some eleven months, was enough and that he should be released immediately. I do not agree. The offender will need to spend further time in prison, although not much. The offender, as I mentioned earlier, must be made aware that committing offences of this kind leads to custodial sentence and that it is not the case that he can simply come before the court, rely on his mental illness and find himself released. On the other hand, as I mentioned, there is a need for proper reflection to be made of the sad condition that the offender is in. I therefore propose to impose a sentence which will consist of a relatively short period in custody followed by a recognizance release order which will have the effect of the offender being at liberty in the community subject to being returned to custody in the event that he breaches the recognizance release order. 

13A treatment plan has been prepared by Dr Furst. It appears to have been produced with some care. I therefore propose to make the recognizance release order subject to the offender complying with the treatment plan and the addition of one further order relating to urine testing. 

14The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for three years. He is to be released on a recognizance release order after serving one year in custody. That is to date from 23 August 2010, so he is to be released from custody on 22 August 2011. The conditions of his recognisance release order are that he enter into a good behaviour bond, himself in the sum of $100, and that he comply with the treatment plan set out by Dr Furst which, for more abundant caution, I will read. 

""The offender is to be placed under the care of the Croydon Mental Health team, 24 Liverpool Road, Croydon or other such suitable local mental health team, depending on the location he resides post release with a view to ongoing case management by the service. 

The offender is to accept a case manager and attend appointments with him or her at a place and frequency as directed, probably fortnightly in the first instance at the Croydon Community Health Centre or his local mental health team. 
The offender is to accept Dr Sophie Kavanagh or delegate as his treating psychiatrist and is to attend appointments with her at a place and frequency as directed, probably monthly in the first instance. 


The offender is to accept medication as prescribed by his treating psychiatrist. He is to remain abstinent from drugs of abuse and accept the recommendations for drug and alcohol counselling as directed by his case manager, including consideration of a residential rehabilitation facility. 


The offender is to undergo regular urine testing and a breach of the order that he remain abstinent from drugs of abuse is to be regarded as a serious breach of the recognisance release order. 


The offender is to engage in psychological therapy to address his past childhood traumas and sexual offending. He is to accept a recommendation to engage in other psychological vocational educational or social activities as deemed necessary by his case manager.""

		26 September 2011",2011-07-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757453,R v DOGAN [2011] NSWDC 86,"SENTENCE 



1HIS HONOUR: Erkan Dogan grew up in rural Queensland. His home life was unusual to the point of being disturbing. He and his siblings, at least most of them, appear to have tried to get away from home as quickly as possible. His older sister moved down to Sydney and when the offender was seventeen he followed. He lived with her for a time but soon began to escalate his drug use, not only recreationally, but also he commenced using steroids as part of his gym activities. Somehow he got into contact with a very serious criminal organisation. At the age of only twenty he committed a large number of serious offences for which he must now be sentenced. 

2The first of those offences was one of possessing more than three unregistered firearms, any one of which is a prohibited firearm. That is an offence that has a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of ten years. Although the standard non-parole period is not of direct application because of the offender's early pleas of guilty, it remains as an important guidepost to the sentence I should impose upon him. The lengthy standard non-parole period of ten years is a good indication as to the seriousness with which parliament says judges should treat offences of this kind. 

3The offender also is to be sentenced for possessing a precursor, that is a substance that can be used to manufacture drugs, in this case 6.39 litres of a substance called safrole. The maximum penalty for that offence is five years imprisonment. 

4Then there are three offences of concealing a serious indictable offence. The first is an offence of concealing the circumstance that other people possessed more than three unregistered firearms, any one of which is a prohibited firearm or pistol. The second is concealing a serious indictable offence of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and the third is concealing a serious indictable offence, namely the possession of people known to the offender of offensive weapons, which were in fact explosive devices. It is important to understand that by his plea of guilty, the offender admits that he understood that those people possessed the explosives with intent themselves to commit indictable offences. 

5What I have described is already a large number of serious offences, but there are more. The offender asks that when I sentence him I take into account fourteen further offences on a form 1. They are attached to the first of the offences I described, the possession of the firearms matters. Those fourteen offences all relate to the offender's possession of other items, prohibited drugs in three cases, goods in custody, (which relates to various forms of police paraphernalia), prohibited weapons, including an imitation submachine gun, extendable batons, ballistic vests and two devices capable of inflicting electric shocks on people. The offender's criminality is very serious indeed. 

6This was all discovered when police executed a search warrant at some premises. There they discovered the items that I have referred to. 

7The agreed facts on sentence are some seventeen and a half pages. They are clearly the product of some cutting and pasting from another document without much thought been given to precisely what it is that a judge needs to know in order to sentence someone. The judge does not need to know for example, exhibit numbers, and yet they appear throughout the statement of facts. I will not delay matters further by being further critical of the statement of facts beyond saying this. There is a real risk that in producing a document of that length the essential criminality of what an offender did is easily hidden. With those remarks out of the way let me turn to what it is agreed that the offender did. 

8The search discovered firstly a number of firearms that were not inside a safe. Those firearms are the subject of the first offence, that is the one with the standard non-parole period. The police located a pump action shotgun. It was in fact loaded. There were five rounds. The statement of facts say they were in the chamber, but I suspect it means they were in the magazine. Police also discovered ammunition suitable for that shotgun. It is also suitable for another shotgun that was discovered inside a safe, which is not the subject of this charge. 

9Police also discovered, again not within the safe, a 7.62 millimetre self-loading rifle with a telescopic sight and a magazine. The magazine was capable of holding thirty 7.62 millimetre cartridges. 

10The next series of firearms discovered by the police were blank firing self-loading pistols, that is they are not themselves capable of killing anyone, in contrast to the shotgun and rifle that I have earlier described. There were four such blank-firing pistols. 

11I mentioned before that there was a safe in the premises. Access was gained to that safe and further items were found. It is important to understand that the offender is not to be sentenced on the basis that he was in possession of the items within the safe. They form the basis of the other offences of concealing a serious indictable offence. 

12With that qualification, police found within the safe another three twelve gauge shotguns, one of which had been shortened. Ammunition was also found. There was another 7.62 millimetre rifle with a telescopic sight. Magazines suitable for 7.62 millimetre ammunition were also found, as well as an enormous quantity of ammunition, over 2,000 cartridges. There was a .22 inch rifle as well, a nine millimetre pistol, another blank-firing revolver, as well as further ammunition and magazines. Other items, the subject of the offences on the form 1, were discovered: An imitation Thompson submachine gun, an extendable baton, two ballistic vests, two imitation rifles, an imitation AK-47, the two devices capable of inflicting electric shocks on people, an imitation self loading pistol and some drugs. As well as the drugs, police discovered 6.39 litres of safrole, the precursor that I mentioned earlier. Also within the safe were thirteen explosive devices and two grenades. They have each been dismantled. One of the devices was a smoke grenade; the other is a device which is used by someone intending to assault another person to distract them. It produces two loud bangs half a second apart. 

13Also in the statement of facts is evidence, which is accepted of course, to indicate the offender's connection and contact with members of an outlaw motorcycle gang, that gang, having been involved in attacks on another outlaw motorcycle gang which is involved in explosions, brawls and the death of one person, the subject of a trial that is presently proceeding in the Supreme Court. 

14To say that the offender has involved himself in serious criminal activity is something of an understatement. He was twenty at the time, he is now twenty-two and he has no prior criminal convictions. He, as I mentioned earlier, grew up in rural Queensland in a family where there was constant abuse. His father was addicted to marijuana and although his mother was warm and caring, she suffers from bipolar disorder. The offender commenced using drugs when he was living at home, stealing his father's drugs. Once he came to Sydney, as I mentioned earlier, his drug use escalated and he must have somehow come into contact with a number of serious criminals who clearly used him as a person who could be trusted to look after their weapons and drugs. 

15The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so is entitled to a discount on his sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas. He also asks that I take into account a matter involving some assistance to the authorities. It is the subject of an affidavit which has been placed in a sealed envelope. The assistance is somewhat limited, it has had the effect of getting two dangerous weapons out of circulation, but it does not extend beyond that. Indeed, on one view, if the offender was aware of those items and had not handed them into police or arranged for that to be done, he could have been charged with a further offence involving a further concealment of a serious offence. Combining the discounts for plea and assistance I will impose a sentence which is thirty per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

16I am required to assess the seriousness of the offence that carries the standard non-parole period with some particularity. Both Mr Turnbull, who appears for the offender, and the Crown, rely on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Mack v R [2-0] NSWCCA 216 , in which a number of factors were identified in determining the seriousness of such an offence. The first concerns the number of firearms, in this case there were six, although it has to be noted that four of those were only capable of firing blanks. All of those items were prohibited firearms. Two of them were dangerous. One of them was loaded. These firearms were not possessed so that they could be displayed as collector's items on a wall either. They were clearly possessed so that they could be used in criminal activity, part of that criminal activity involving, as the evidence would clearly indicate, illegal drug supply. Although some items were found in a safe, the items the subject of this specific offence, were not. As I have mentioned earlier, ammunition suitable to the firearms was found nearby. For those reasons the objective gravity of this offence is within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The major circumstance preventing the finding of greater objective gravity concerns the circumstance that four of the firearms were not lethal. 

17The offender spent almost a year and a half in custody before being released on bail. Because of these offences and the fact that police have detected them and because that has led to a significant quantity of material being seized by police, the offender's safety is at risk. It does not take much imagination to conclude that the outlaw motorcycle gang who were responsible for all of these items would be very displeased at what has happened and are likely to seek some form of retribution. The offender was placed in what is in effect solitary confinement for some time. The circumstances of such custody are extreme. Fortunately the conditions were relaxed. His sister, who gave evidence today, noted a change in his behaviour once that occurred. But he has done his time in custody thus far in circumstances which are very different from the circumstances applying to the general prison population and there is a real risk, in fact a very good chance, that he will serve the remainder of his sentence in some form of protection. If that happens there is a real risk and indeed again a very good chance that this will involve conditions of custody, which are harsher than those which apply to the general prison population. 

18I have mentioned a couple of times that the offender was a fairly young person at the time he committed these offences. The evidence would also suggest that he was vulnerable to the influence of others. I accept that that is the case. His age, his background and his drug use all made him a target for more serious criminals. He is, I accept, quite a different person now to the person he was when he committed these offences. He does have good prospects of rehabilitation. His offending extended over a relatively short period of time and of course there is no suggestion that he was going to commit any of the serious criminal offences which others were going to. On the other hand, by his pleas of guilty, he admits he was aware of the use to which at least some of the items were going to be put. 

19It is impossible to describe his behaviour as anything other than very serious criminality indeed. For that reason he must go to gaol for a lengthy period of time. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of what an offender has done. 

20It is necessary also to recognise that there are multiple offences here. Although all of the offences were in effect committed at the one time, they represent different aspects of the offender's criminality and so there must be an accumulation of sentence. The principle of totality of course operates significantly in the offender's favour. I should also say at this stage that because the sentence for the standard non-parole period offence, will be served after the sentence for the other two offences, the circumstance that there is accumulation leads to the standard non-parole period being less than it would be if it were standing alone. Were the offender an older man when he committed these offences, the sentences that I would impose upon him would be much longer than the ones I will shortly announce. The sentence must reflect not only the offences but also the offender. For that reason I have reduced the sentences significantly because of the offender's age and his vulnerability at the time. 

21The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for each of the offences of concealing a serious indictable offence. I impose a fixed term of eighteen months to have commenced on 13 February 2010, which takes account of his presentence custody. For the offence of possessing precursor, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of eighteen months to date from 13 February 2011. Those sentences are fixed term because of the sentence I will now announce. The offence of possessing more than three unregistered firearms, any one of which is a prohibited firearm, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 13 August 2011. It will expire on 12 February 2014. I set a head sentence in that case of five and a half years. The overall sentence is thus, a non-parole period of four years and a head sentence of seven years. It will be clear that I have made a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. They of course relate to his age, the fact that this is his first time in custody and that he will serve his sentence on protection.

		10 August 2011",2011-07-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757456,R v Hawi & ors (No 13) [2011] NSWSC 1659,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: On 19 July 2011 I announced my decision to admit a portion of a document marked for identification 50 and to not admit certain pages of a document marked for identification 53. These are my reasons. 

2The relevant factual background is that the trial is concerned with two episodes of violent activity that occurred at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. The Crown contends that unlawful violence, constituting an affray, occurred in the vicinity of Gate 5 and that further unlawful violence, constituting a riot, occurred minutes later in the departure hall. The latter culminated in the death of the deceased. 

3The Crown has called a witness, AL, who was responsible for some of the violent conduct. He obtained a reduced sentence after pleading guilty to affray and riot upon his undertaking to give evidence for the prosecution. His credibility is in issue. 

4The documents in question were shown to AL by Mr Stratton SC who appears for the accused Menzies. Following certain denials made by AL, Mr Stratton tendered the documents. The Crown objected to their admission into evidence. 

5The document which is MFI 50 is a single page of notes from the files of the Corrections Health Service of Corrective Services NSW. They are notes of an interview of AL on 29 November 2001. I was satisfied that they are a business record and that they contain a record of a previous representation made by AL: Evidence Act 1995, s 69(1). The note that is of interest to Mr Stratton is: 


Drug Hx 
Speed = 1 gm day = Pure - Injection 
Heroin = 1/4 per day = Injection 
THC = $50 per day = Cones 
Alcohol = Social drinks 

6AL was cross-examined about his prior drug use. He admitted to having used speed and cannabis but he was adamant that he had never touched heroin (T2201; T2224). He was specifically asked about whether he had made the prior representation recorded in MFI 50 and maintained, ""I used speed, yes, but not heroin"" . 

7I had previously indicated that I would admit another document that includes a prior representation by AL that he had used heroin. MFI 50 is similarly admissible. It contains a record of a prior inconsistent statement that renders the claim by AL in his evidence that he had never touched heroin capable of being regarded by the jury as a lie. I am satisfied that if the jury concluded that it was a lie, it could substantially affect the assessment of his credibility: Evidence Act 1995, s 103(1). That is because the jury could reason that if a person had ever used heroin in their life, it is something they would never forget for the rest of their life. There is nothing equivocal about the denial by AL. He most stridently maintained that he had never touched that drug. The subject matter of the prior representation is, relatively speaking, unimportant. It is the fact that AL was prepared to make such an adamant denial, in the face of what he must obviously have said to the contrary, that is the point. 

8For these reasons I held that the document which is MFI 50 was admissible. However I limited what was to be admitted to the relevant portion, and so much as would place it in context. The balance of the document contains material that was not sought to be placed before the jury and/or contains commentary by the author that does not amount to a prior representation by AL. 

9The other document, MFI 53, was more contentious. There are about 25 pages in the document and they are from the records of Nepean Hospital. They relate to an admission of AL as an involuntary patient following an arrest and court appearance on 28 March 2001. Mr Stratton cross-examined AL in respect of four pages in the document which were tabbed and numbered 1 to 4. It was those four pages which were tendered. 

10The first four pages of the document are headed ""Discharge Summary"". Tab 1 is the second of the four pages. Of particular relevance, according to Mr Stratton's submission, is something which appears under a heading, ""Major presenting symptoms, history of present illness and mental state on admission: 

Claims he was hit on the head by an iron bar 5 weeks ago for which he required stitches. No loss of consciousness. Since head injury, complaining of poor memory, difficulty concentrating, see things ""like people moving"" and hearing voice telling him ""to go away"". Also complaining of feeling irritable, short tempered and being easily angered. Wanting to harm and/or kill people. "" (Emphasis added) 

11Tab 2 is a page within a document that has the title ""Emergency Registration"". It records details of the arrival of AL at the hospital and the circumstances (e.g. ""Pt BIB Police under a section 33""). It records that he arrived at the hospital on 28 March 2001 at 5.20pm; was assessed by a triage nurse at that time; and was then seen by somebody else, seemingly a doctor, at 6.00pm. It is a page of the notes recorded during the latter assessment that is tab 2. The notes are, in part, the history obtained from AL. They include: 


""Claims . Hit on head by iron bar 5 weeks ago 
               . required stitches. No LOC 




Since then 
loss of memory 
difficulty concentrating 
sees things - ""like people moving"" 
hears voices - won't say what 
Also 
feels angry / short tempered

12Tab 4, numbered in the order in which Mr Stratton cross-examined, but, third in the order in which they appear in the entire document, is dated 28 March 2001. It includes: 

""1145 hours (sic - 2345 hrs?) nursing: Sam is a 42 year old male brought into hospital on a Section 33 by police with ? Drug induced psychosis with anti social traits ... It was reported that he was drowsy + initially unco-operative & very angry, that he had homicidal ideation towards his ex-wife's family . It was also reported that he had persecutory delusions, auditory & visual halucinations (sic) + risk assessment towards others = medium ... Police to be informed prior to pt being discharged. Settled in bed."" (Emphasis added) 

13Tab 3 comprises notes dated and timed 29 March 2001 at 1815 hours. They are headed ""Sanbrook/Tsovolos Review"". It can be deduced from material elsewhere in the document that this is a reference to Dr Sanbrook, psychiatrist, and Dr Tsovolos, registrar. Of particular relevance is the following: 

""Hearing a voice telling him ""to get this person + get him now"". Doesn't know where the voice comes from - it comes from his shoulder. Male voice, telling him be a man go and do it, go and get this business, go and hurt this person, go and kill him. Voice has not told him which person to kill. Voice comes from outside his head. There since the hit on the head"". (Emphasis added) 

14The portions I have italicised in the above extracts were said to be of particular significance. 

15The documents at tab 1 and tab 4 may be immediately rejected. They do not purport to set out anything like a quotation of what AL had said. They are summaries of what others have recorded elsewhere in the records. They are not admissible. The documents at tabs 2 and 3 remain to be considered. 

16The relevant passage of the cross-examination of AL was as follows: 

""Q. Did you tell the doctor that you felt irritable, short-tempered and easily angered? 
A. Easily what, sorry? 

Q. Easily angered. You became angered easily? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you tell the doctor that you had thoughts of wanting to harm and/or kill people? 
A. No, myself. 

STRATTON: Could that set of documents be marked for identification and then be returned to me? 

MFI #50 above bundle of documents SHOWN TO WITNESS [AL] 

Q. I've turned that same document to another page. I'm going to ask that that be handed to you. Could I ask you to read the section that's been highlighted, Mr [AL] (MFI 50 shown to witness)? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Have you read that? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Does that assist your memory as to whether or not you told a doctor that you wanted to harm and/or kill people? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I object to this. 

WITNESS: No. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, the witness has answered. 

HIS HONOUR: He's answered. It doesn't help him to recollect. 

STRATTON: Might I have the MFI back and I will turn it to another page? 

HIS HONOUR: That whole bundle will be regarded as MFI 50. Can you just indicate what page within the bundle was just shown to the witness? 

STRATTON: It's marked with a tab. I will put a ""2"" on it, your Honour. 

Q. Could I take you to another page? 

HIS HONOUR: Do you want to put a number on that one, Mr Stratton? 

STRATTON: Yes, I will put the number ""3"" on it. 

Q. Could you read that to yourself, Mr [AL] (MFI 50 shown to witness)? 
A. Yes. 

HIS HONOUR: All of it or just the highlighted part? 

STRATTON: Perhaps just the highlighted part, your Honour. 

(Witness complied.) 

STRATTON: Could that MFI be returned to me for a moment? (Handed). 

Q. Having read that document, do you remember telling medical staff that you had been hearing a voice telling you to get this person or ""get him now"". You do not know where the voice comes from, it comes from his shoulder, a male voice telling you ""be a man and go and do it, go and get this business, go and hurt this person, go and kill him."" The voice didn't tell you which person to kill. The voice comes from outside your head. Do you remember saying that to a doctor? 
A. I don't remember why it's saying there going to kill people and everything because all I do is try to kill myself. 

Q. Did you tell another member of the medical staff that you were thinking about killing your ex-wife's family? 
A. No, sir. 

Q. Would you have a look at this page which is marked with a ""4"". Could you just read the paragraph that contains some highlighting in it (shown to witness)? 
A. (Witness complied). 

Q. Have you read that? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Does that assist your memory as to whether or not you told medical staff about whether you had thoughts about killing your ex-wife's family? 
A. No."" (T2204-2206)(Emphasis added) 

17Mr Stratton contended that the documents were admissible on three bases. The first was that they were relevant to the determination of a disputed question of fact, that being whether or not AL was more involved in the violence than he was prepared to admit. AL's evidence is that he threw a single punch in the course of the Gate 5 affray and he threw a single punch in the subsequent departure hall riot. In each case, his punch was a reaction to being struck by someone else. The case for Mr Menzies is that AL had downplayed his role and shifted the blame to others. 

18The second basis is that there is an issue as to whether or not AL was involved in the fatal assault upon the deceased. The Crown contends that three of the accused were so involved, including the accused Menzies. Some eyewitnesses have said that there were a greater number of assailants. AL has denied that he had any direct involvement in causing the death. 

19I understand that Mr Stratton will refer to certain eyewitness descriptions of the persons involved in the assault upon the deceased in support of the proposition that there is a reasonable possibility that AL was involved. The Crown has argued, in effect, that on no view of the evidence could it be said that there was such a possibility. That is not an issue that I believe I need to resolve. Even if Mr Stratton's assertion is tenuous, there is nothing to prevent him making the submission. He has complied sufficiently with the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. 

20Mr Stratton's contention is that evidence that AL heard voices which gave rise to thoughts of harming and/or killing people was relevant to the jury's determination of these two disputed questions of fact. AL denied that he had such thoughts. Accordingly, so it was submitted, evidence of AL's prior representations to that effect should be admitted. 

21It was acknowledged that there is no evidence of AL experiencing such auditory hallucinations subsequent to 2001. It was submitted, however, that an absence of evidence does not mean that AL did not have such experiences. Mr Stratton pointed to the difficulty for the defence in obtaining evidence. The latest report he had in relation to AL was that of a psychologist which was prepared in 2005. It records various admissions of AL to psychiatric facilities prior to that year. There is no reliable source available to the defence from which it could be ascertained whether there had been subsequent admissions. AL, it was contended, was an unreliable historian on the subject. 

22Assuming it to be a fact that AL was hearing voices in March 2001 and that they were telling him to harm or kill people, I fail to see how that can have any relevance to the two factual issues to which Mr Stratton has referred. There is no evidence that the experience AL reported in March 2001 recurred, as opposed to it being an isolated instance. If the experience was related to his abuse of amphetamines at the time (there is reference in an ""Interim Discharge Summary"" to a diagnosis of drug induced psychosis), it is to be noted that the evidence before the jury, albeit only from AL himself, is that he last used that drug in 2004 or 2005. 

23To suggest that because AL had such an experience in March 2001, he might possibly have had the same experience eight years later, specifically on 22 March 2009 would, in my view, be an invitation to the jury to speculate in the absence of evidence. 

24For these reasons I was of the view that the documents at tabs 2 and 3 of MFI 50 were not relevant to the assessment of the two facts in issue that were identified: Evidence Act , ss 55 & 56. 

25It was not part of my determination, but I note that there was no cross-examination of AL as to whether he was hearing voices which commanded him to harm and/or kill people in March 2009, or indeed at any time subsequent to March 2001. 

26The third basis upon which it was contended that the documents were admissible was that proof of the prior representations made by AL to the staff at the Nepean Hospital could substantially affect the assessment of his credibility. It can be seen from the extract from the cross-examination set out earlier that he denied having made the representations and denied the subject matter of them. The effect of his evidence was that he had not heard voices telling him to harm and/or kill other people. The submission was that the documents could prove the making of a prior inconsistent statement. 

27The subject matter of these representations is, however, in a different category to the prior inconsistent representations concerning heroin use. As I indicated in relation to that topic, past heroin use is capable of being regarded by a jury as being something that AL would never forget and so a flat denial in his evidence in the trial could be regarded as substantially affecting his credibility. The representations now being considered were made 10 years ago at a time when AL was regarded as being mentally ill. The experience of a person in such a state who is hearing voices is not one that would carry the same expectation of recall as to what the voices were saying, particularly many years later. 

28Whether the evidence in question could substantially affect the assessment of AL's credibility must also be considered in the light of other evidence that is before the jury. It includes the following: 


AL has had a number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals: 

- initially he said ""about two"" (T2199); 
- he agreed he had been admitted to Mount Druitt Hospital after drinking petrol in 2001 (T2199); 
- he agreed he had been admitted to Pialla at Nepean Hospital (T2199); 
- he agreed he had spent three weeks in the psychiatric ward of Blacktown Hospital (T2200); 
- he agreed that he had been admitted to Wisteria House at Cumberland Hospital from 4 to 9 March 1998 (T2200); 
- he also agreed that he had been admitted to Cumberland Hospital on 16 July 1999 (T2201); 
- he could not recall a third admission to Cumberland Hospital on 25 October 1999 (T2201); and 
- he agreed he was in Nepean Hospital from 28 March to 3 April 2001 (T2203). 


AL agreed that he had experienced problems with his memory after he was hit on the head with an iron bar in 2001 (T2202). 

He agreed that he had told a doctor at Nepean Hospital in 2001 that since the head injury he had poor memory and difficulty concentrating; he was seeing things, like people moving; he could hear voices when there was no-one there; he could hear voices telling him to go away; and he said that he felt irritable, short-tempered and easily angered (T2203-2204). 

He agreed that he had said in 2001 that he was ""just hearing voices ... I was just trying to harm myself"" (T2206). 

He had once seen a ghost, in Samoa, but denied saying that he had seen ""ghosts"" (T2206). (Exhibit 19 was subsequently admitted which contains the prior representation as having seen ghosts). 

29If AL's denial was of something that he should have been able to recall, notwithstanding that it occurred during some type of psychotic mental disorder and notwithstanding that a decade had elapsed, then it may have been something that could substantially affect the assessment of his credibility. Regard must be had to the word, ""substantially"". In my view, it is questionable whether AL's denial could affect the assessment of his credibility at all and, in the light of all of the other material relevant to credibility, and particularly that which I have set out above, I concluded that the documents were not admissible on the third of the bases relied upon.

2757458,Flack v R [2011] NSWCCA 167,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Johnson J. 

2HIDDEN J : I agree with Johnson J. 

3JOHNSON J : This is an application for an extension of time to appeal against conviction by Robin Anthony Flack, who was convicted by a jury of five counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s.178BA Crimes Act 1900. 

4The Applicant stood trial before his Honour Judge Knox SC and a jury between 16 and 27 February 2009. Following his conviction by the jury on all counts, the Applicant was sentenced on 19 May 2009 to five concurrent sentences of imprisonment for two-and-a-half years, with non-parole periods of 18 months to date from 19 May 2009 and expiring on 18 November 2010. 

5A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 21 May 2009. Five applications for extension of that Notice were granted by the Registrar, with a sixth application being declined in June 2010. A Notice of Application for Extension of Time to file a Notice of Appeal was filed on 9 February 2011, accompanied by an affidavit sworn on 8 February 2011 by the Applicant's solicitor, which sought to explain the Applicant's delay in proceeding in this Court. 

6The Crown opposed the application for an extension of time in this case, relying upon the significant delay and what was said to be the lack of merit of the proposed ground of appeal. 

7This Court has emphasised the clear public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court and the demanding test to be applied where an extension of time is sought: McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174 at [5]-[7]; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [38]-[39]. It is appropriate to assess the merits of the Applicant's ground of appeal for the purpose of determining whether an extension of time ought be granted in this case. 

The Ground of Appeal 

8The Applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal: 

""His Honour erred in rejecting the no case submission and dismissing the application for a directed verdict."" 

9By Notice of Abandonment filed on 10 March 2011, the Applicant abandoned his appeal against sentence. 

The Trial 

10The Applicant stood trial with a co-accused, Kenneth Grindrod (""Grindrod""), upon an indictment containing five counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception contrary to s.178BA Crimes Act 1900 . The first count was in the following terms: 

""Between 1 January 2003 and 7 February 2003 at Sydney and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, by a deception, namely by falsely representing that a bus with Engine No: F0206691 and Chassis/VIN: 1BAGNBXA32F207843 existed to the Bank of Western Australia, dishonestly obtained for Willowstar Pty Limited trading as Australian Autobus financial advantage, namely $279,400.00.""

12It was the Crown case at trial that the Applicant and Grindrod were involved jointly and severally in various companies. The evidence at trial was that the Applicant and Grindrod made false representations to financial institutions to obtain loans for purchasing buses identified by engine and chassis/VIN numbers from a bus building company, Willowstar Pty Limited. The loan documents were all hire/asset purchase agreements. 

13Prior to the commencement of the trial, there was discussion between counsel and the trial Judge concerning issues that might arise during the trial and directions that the Judge may need to give to the jury. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that there may need to be an inference direction covering the position of employees (T19). 

14The Crown Prosecutor opened to the jury that it was essential that the jury be satisfied that the deception caused the financial institution to pay money (T57). She indicated to the jury that they would hear from officers of the financial institutions as to receipt of documents and the payment of money by those institutions (T57). 

15The Applicant's counsel opened to the jury that they should focus upon why the financial institutions lent the money, and suggested that it was not caused by the behaviour of the Applicant or his co-accused (T58-60). 

16As a result of an enquiry by the trial Judge, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that it was the Crown case that the financial institutions would not have handed over the money had they known that the representations in the documents that the buses existed were false (T93). The Applicant's counsel indicated that there was a question over the capacity of the witnesses from the financial institutions to give this evidence (T96). 

17During the course of the Crown case, trial counsel for the Applicant stated that a no-case submission would be made, with reliance to be placed upon the decision of this Court in R v Ho; R v Szeto (1989) 39 A Crim R 145 (T572). 

18The trial Judge heard submissions, in the context of an objection to the capacity of an officer of the relevant financial institution to give evidence as to whether the financial institution would have approved the loan, when that officer was not the one who originally dealt with the application. The initial objection was directed to a witness, Julie Begg, giving evidence concerning the procedures and practices of Capital Finance Australia Limited (the third count). The trial Judge ruled in favour of the Crown on the admissibility of the evidence of Ms Begg, and similar evidence to be given by other persons regarding the other financial institutions (the first, second, fourth and fifth counts). 

19Evidence was given by an officer of each of the financial institutions that, had his or her company been aware that no bus existed (contrary to what had been particularised in the application), then the company would not have approved the loan. Evidence to this effect was given by: 

(a) Gavin Black, Manager of Business Recoveries with the Bank of Western Australia (first count) (T653); 

(b) Graham Phillips, Fraud Investigator with the Bank of Queensland - UFJ Finance Australia Limited had changed its name to BOQ [Bank of Queensland] Equipment Finance (second count) (T733); 

(c) Julie Begg, Senior Manager in the Fraud Protection Area at Capital Finance Australia Limited (third count) (T607); and 

(d) John Brown, General Manager of the Client Services Division of Orix Australia Corporation Limited (fourth and fifth counts) (T695). 

20There was no challenge on appeal to his Honour's decision to allow this evidence to be given by each of these persons from the relevant financial institutions. 

21The Crown closed its case on 25 February 2009 (T857). Thereafter, counsel for the Applicant made a no-case submission, contending that the officers from the financial institutions were not qualified to give evidence about whether the loan would have been approved, if no bus existed. It was submitted that there was a complete lack of any evidence which could lead to an inference that the cause of the handing over of the money to Willowstar Pty Limited was a present belief, by any bank or financial institution employee, that the buses existed at the time the money was sent (AB657). It was submitted that the Crown had not called to give evidence the person who approved the loan in each case, and whose mind had been deceived. As a result, it was submitted that there was no nexus between the deception and the payment (AB661). 

22On 26 February 2009, the trial Judge rejected the no-case submission and refused the application by the Applicant for a verdict by direction. 

23In the course of his judgment rejecting the no-case submission, the trial Judge said (AB28): 

""In relation to each count, a representative of each of the financial institutions said that the particular institution would not have made the loan had buses not existed. In some cases, for example in the contracts with Orix (counts 4 and 5), the documents stated that the goods were located at Bathurst. This evidence is subject to challenge by the Defence which asserts that the relevant officers cannot give this evidence - particularly where those officers in some cases had not been employees of the relevant institutions at the relevant time. I over-ruled this objection on the basis that the employee witnesses were authorised by their relevant institutions to appear and give evidence from the business records of the organisation and knowledge of the business practices of the particular institution."" 

24The trial Judge indicated that, where the deception was upon an institution and not an individual, the actual person who approved the loan was not a necessary witness. His Honour observed that the deception was on the institution, and evidence had been given as to the practices of all the institutions and the documentation on which each relied (AB32). 

25His Honour's reasons for rejecting the Applicant's no-case submission included the following conclusions (AB33): 

""In my view the evidence is such that the jury could be satisfied that there was a deception on the relevant institutions by the total course of conduct of the accused. There is evidence which, if accepted, could support an inference that, on each count, there was a representation which was deceptive and that the respective financial institution acted on it to advance the monies which were then utilised by the accused. The applications as transmitted to the financial institutions contained a great deal of particularity as to what might be inferred was an existing bus (including the engine, chassis and VIN numbers) as well as associated documentation such as insurance cover documentation which would support the view that the particular bus was in existence. 

The determination of the final issue will in large measure depend on the jury's assessment of the evidence of Mr King and the relevant documentation as well as the course of conduct of the employees of Willowstar and the accused, particularly concerning the provision of the invoices. But in my view, at the end of the Crown case, there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could come to such a view that, on each count, there was a deception and that the financial institution acted on the basis of the representations made."" 

26The Applicant and Grindrod did not give evidence in the trial. The jury convicted the Applicant of each of the five offences. 

27In the course of passing sentence upon the Applicant and Grindrod, the sentencing Judge said ( R v Flack; R v Grindrod [2009] NSWDC 94 at [2]-[4], [11]): 

""2 The particulars for each count were substantially the same. The offences all occurred within a three/four month period between January and April 2003. The offences involved false representations about various identification numbers for buses. Those numbers were obtained by the offenders using their knowledge of the vehicle financing industry and the systems of the entity, Willowstar Pty Ltd. ('Willowstar'), by whom the buses were to be constructed. The buses were never constructed. No evidence has been adduced to show they existed. 

3 As a result of those representations, the offenders obtained a financial advantage for Willowstar in each of the five counts on the indictment for amounts ranging from $297,000 to $394,000. In turn, Willowstar, through its officers, directed those payments, less a deposit, to a company of which the offender, Flack was a director, with which Grindrod was associated. Grindrod received a commission based on each of the transactions. 

4 The amounts alleged in forensic accounting evidence was given in the trial by Mr John Fogarty, a Fraud Squad officer, showed that the offenders received benefits of the order of $1,544,000. The amount repaid was $512,787, which is approximately 30%. 

... 

11 The offenders falsely represented to five financial institutions that five buses with particular engine numbers and particular chassis and engine numbers existed. At no stage did the buses exist and the details of the buses as stated by the offenders to the financial institutions were fictional. The offenders knew the falsity of both those matters."" 

28No challenge is made in this Court to any of the directions given to the jury. Nor is it contended that the verdicts were unreasonable or not supported by the evidence. 

Submissions in this Court 

29Mr Coyne, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that, whilst it was not necessary to establish that it was the person deceived who suffered the loss, there must be a causal connection between the deception and the obtaining of the financial advantage. It was an essential ingredient of an offence under s.178BA that the cause of the payment was the deception used: R v Ho; R v Szeto . 

30In the circumstances of this case, Mr Coyne submitted that, without evidence from the persons responsible for the approval of the loans, the Crown could not show that the cause of the various loan approvals were the deceptions of the Applicant. It was further submitted that, notwithstanding the legal identity of the entity responsible for the loan, there was still a requirement in this case for a person to have been deceived. 

31The Crown submitted that inferences were plainly open in the circumstances of this case that the deceptive statements concerning the existence of the buses were relied upon for the purpose of extending the relevant loan facilities to the Applicant. In addition, the Crown submitted that there was direct evidence from officers of each of the four lending entities with respect to the significance of the deceptive statements to the giving of the loans. 

32The Crown submitted that it was not the case that this element of the charges could only be established by calling evidence from the persons who played an active part in the approval of the relevant loans. 

Decision 

33The sole ground of appeal falls to be determined upon the basis that it raises a question of law alone. In R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377; 48 NSWLR 101, Dunford J (Greg James J agreeing) said at 130 [127]: 

""In determining whether there is a case to answer, the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands, the accused ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands, he could lawfully be convicted: May v O'Sullivan (1995) 92 CLR 654 at 658. In considering such an application, the judge does not consider the probative value of the evidence as a whole, but only that evidence which, if believed and uncontradicted, could be accepted as proof of the Crown case: R v Towers (1984) 14 A Crim R 12 at 14, Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214-215, R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74; and in a case of circumstantial evidence, such as the present, a finding of no case to answer is not open if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused can be convicted, even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be postulated: R v JMR (1991) 39 A Crim R 39 at 44."" 

34To make good this ground, it is necessary for the Applicant to establish that there was no case to answer in accordance with these principles. 

35Section 178BA Crimes Act 1900 was repealed upon the commencement of the Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009 , which commenced on 22 February 2010. The successor offence to s.178BA is now contained in s.192E Crimes Act 1900 . 

36On a prosecution for an alleged offence under s.178BA Crimes Act 1900 , it is not necessary for the Crown to establish that it was the person deceived who suffered the relevant loss: R v Ho; R v Szeto at 147. 

37What must be established, however, is a causal connection between the deception used and the financial advantage obtained. The deception must have been the means whereby the financial advantage was obtained, or the effective cause of the financial advantage being obtained. It is an essential ingredient of an offence under s.178BA that the cause of the giving of the financial advantage was the deception used by the accused person: R v Stanhope (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 September 1987, pages 6-8); R v Clarkson [1987] VR 962 at 980; R v Ho; R v Szeto at 147. 

38The question whether the deception was an operative cause of the obtaining of financial advantage, falls to be answered as a question of fact by the members of the jury applying their commonsense: R v King [1987] 1 QB 547 at 553. 

39As the Crown submitted in this Court, commonsense and inferences had a role to play in this case. The loan documents required identification details of the ""goods involved"" . This was by way of engine and VIN numbers. There needed to be a certificate of currency for the ""goods"" . There was also a requirement for the ""goods"" to be insured. There were in fact insurance policies taken out for each of the five ""goods"" , separately identified by individual VIN and engine numbers. The evidence revealed that these policies were for existing property (T767). There was a requirement, for at least some of the loans, that there be an acknowledgement that the ""goods"" had been inspected by the borrower. 

40The applications to the financial institutions in each case contained considerable details which could be inferred as identifying a particular bus which was in existence, including insurance coverage for an identified bus. The representations contained in the documentation supporting the applications were available to establish that those representations were deceptive, and were an operating factor on the conduct of the financial institutions in approving the loans. This inference was available with respect to each of the five counts. It was not necessary that the actual person who processed the loan give evidence. 

41Support for this approach may be found in the decision of the High Court of Australia in National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Limited v Batty [1986] HCA 21; 160 CLR 251, a decision relied upon by the Crown at trial. In that case, Brennan J said at 273: 

""Yeldham J found that Davis had been guilty of fraud, though there was no direct evidence that a bank officer had been induced to collect the cheques or pay money in reliance on any representation that Davis had made. The absence of such evidence was not necessarily a bar to recovery, however, for inducement may be inferred from the doing of something after the making of a representation calculated to induce the doing of that thing: Smith v Chadwick (1884) 9 App Cas 187 at 196. Whether inducement should be inferred is a question of fact dependent on all the circumstances, not a question of law."" 

42Brennan J observed, at 273, that such an inference may be drawn in criminal as well as civil cases, as the House of Lords had held in R v Lambie [1982] AC 449. 

43Again, in National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Limited v Batty , Gibbs CJ (Wilson J agreeing) said at 258: 

""In the present case it is right to conclude that loss was caused to the bank by the wrongful act of Mr Davis. By lodging the cheques for deposit, Davis impliedly represented to the bank that he was entitled to do so - in other words, his conduct implied that he either was the owner of the cheques or was acting with the authority of the owner: cf R v Lambie [1982] AC 449 at 460. It was, of course, necessary for the bank to prove that it had been induced by the implied representation to act to its detriment by collecting the proceeds of the cheques. The bank called no evidence that it relied upon the representation but it may be inferred that it did so. In Smith v Chadwick (1884) 9 App Cas 187 at 196, Lord Blackburn said: 

'I do not think it is necessary, in order to prove this, that the plaintiff always should be called as a witness to swear that he acted upon the inducement. At the time when Pasley v Freeman [2 Sm LC 66, 73, 86 (8th ed)] was decided, and for many years afterwards, he could not be so called. I think that if it is proved that the defendants with a view to induce the plaintiff to enter into a contract made a statement to the plaintiff of such a nature as would be likely to induce a person to enter into a contract, and it is proved that the plaintiff did enter into the contract, it is a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the statement.' 

It was a fair inference of fact in the present case that the bank collected the proceeds of the cheques because it was induced to believe that Davis was entitled to deposit them. If it had known that Davis had no authority to deposit the cheques it is inconceivable that it would have collected the proceeds: cf R v Lambie ."" 

44In the leading judgment in R v Lambie , Lord Roskill, at 460, referred to difficulties if convictions could: 

""... only be obtained if the prosecution are able in each case to call the person on whom the fraud was immediately perpetrated to say that he or she positively remembered the particular transaction and, had the truth been known, would never have entered into that supposedly well-remembered transaction, the guilty would often escape conviction. In some cases, of course, it may be possible to adduce such evidence if the particular transaction is well remembered. But where as in the present case no one could reasonably be expected to remember a particular transaction in detail, and the inference of inducement may well be in all the circumstances quite irresistible, I see no reason in principle why it should not be left to the jury to decide, on the evidence in the case as a whole, whether that inference is in truth irresistible as to my mind it is in the present case."" 

45Mr Coyne sought unsuccessfully in this Court to distinguish these cases on the facts. To my mind, the principles expressed in these decisions have application to the present case. 

46The question for the trial Judge, at the end of the Crown case, was whether there was, as a matter of law, a case to answer on each of the counts contained in the indictment. The Crown case involved a combination of inferences to be drawn from the documentary evidence, and the direct evidence of the officers of each of the relevant financial institutions. 

47Applying the principles referred to at [33] above, there was a clear case to answer on each of the five counts. His Honour was correct to reject the no-case application and to decline to direct verdicts of acquittal with respect to each count against the Applicant. 

Conclusion 

48The sole ground of appeal relied upon by the Applicant is, in my view, without merit. As the ground advanced lacks merit, the application for an extension of time to appeal should be refused. 

49The order which I propose is that an extension of time to appeal against conviction should be refused.

2757463,Regina v Malcolm Potier [2011] NSWCCA 170,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA: I agree with McCallum J. 

2McCALLUM J: On 9 May 2000, Malcolm Potier was arrested and charged with two counts of soliciting a person to murder Mr Potier's ex de facto wife and her new partner. In October 2001, after a trial by jury, he was convicted of those offences. 

3In April 2002, before being sentenced for the offences, Mr Potier was charged with a third offence of soliciting to murder, also relating to his ex de facto wife. 

4Mr Potier was subsequently sentenced for the first two offences to two fully concurrent terms of imprisonment of 6 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 8 May 2000. He appealed to this Court against his convictions and sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. The Crown lodged an appeal against the leniency of the sentences imposed. 

5After a number of adjournments on the application of Mr Potier, the appeals were finally listed for hearing in 2004, but Mr Potier was still not in a position to pursue the conviction appeal. The Court proceeded to determine the two sentence appeals, refusing leave to Mr Potier to appeal against severity and allowing the Crown appeal: R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136. The Court did not vary the terms of the sentences imposed at first instance but accumulated one upon the other by two years and thus increased the aggregate non-parole period. 

6On 17 February 2006, the conviction appeal was dismissed: Potier v R [2006] NSWCCA 27. Following the determination of that appeal, Mr Potier was tried for the third offence. It appears that the trial had been deliberately postponed until after the determination of the conviction appeal in respect of the first two offences, since the Crown sought to rely upon evidence adduced at the first trial, and the fact of Mr Potier's conviction for the first two offences, as tendency and coincidence evidence in support of the third offence. 

7Mr Potier was convicted of the third offence in late 2006. The matters presently before the Court relate to his appeal to this Court against that conviction, which is still pending. 

8In October 2010, Mr Potier made an application for orders compelling two persons (a juror at Mr Potier's first trial and a former police officer) to attend and be examined before the Court. RA Hulme J dismissed that application: Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 231. 

9His Honour heard the application sitting as a single judge pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The application having been refused, Mr Potier is entitled, and has sought, to have it determined by the Court in accordance with s 22(2) of the Act. This judgment determines that application. 

10Separately and on the same day as the determination of the application for orders compelling the attendance of witnesses, RA Hulme J dismissed an application by Mr Potier for bail pending the determination of the conviction appeal: Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 234. Mr Potier has sought review of the bail decision, but that application has not yet been heard, having been adjourned at the hearing before us on the application of Mr Potier. 

Circumstances in which the application was brought 

11Mr Potier was in migration detention at the time he was arrested for the first two offences. An important feature of the Crown case in respect of those offences was evidence of recordings of telephone conversations that allegedly took place between Mr Potier and a prosecution informant. Mr Potier put a case to the jury (and has maintained ever since) that those recordings had been altered or manufactured. 

12Evidence was given during the first trial that police had obtained a ""web trace"" of the telephone line of the informant, the records of which disclosed that, as to nine recordings of telephone calls allegedly made by Mr Potier to the informant, five had failed to register as being received on the web trace. A witness called by the Crown (an employee of Optus Cable and Wireless) gave two alternative explanations for that fact: that the search methods of those administering the web trace were at fault and had failed to locate the missing calls and, alternatively, that the calls had not been made. 

13The witness suggested that the issue could be resolved by obtaining Telstra's records of the telephone accounts for the telephones from which the calls were allegedly made. No such records were made available at the first trial. After putting a case to the jury that he should be given the benefit of the doubt as to whether the calls were in fact made, Mr Potier was convicted. 

14As already noted, an appeal against that conviction was heard in 2006, before Mr Potier's trial for the third offence. The appeal was based, in part, on allegedly fresh evidence. Mr Potier claimed that, after he was convicted, he became aware that the Crown Prosecutor had sought and obtained the Telstra records referred to in the evidence of the Crown witness who gave evidence about the web trace. It is Mr Potier's contention that the telephone records reveal that the very same five telephone calls not detected on the web trace are also absent from the Telstra telephone records, suggesting a reasonable possibility consistent with Mr Potier's defence at the trial that the calls were never made (and, implicitly, that the purported recordings of those calls put in evidence at the first trial were recordings that had been altered or manufactured). 

15The Court in that appeal held that the evidence was not ""fresh"" ( Potier v R [2007] NSWCCA 27 at [49] per McClellan CJ at CL, Hislop and Rothman JJ agreeing at [97] and [98] respectively): 

I have already referred to the position in relation to Mr Finlay's evidence. With respect to the Telstra material, the Crown tendered evidence on the appeal, which indicates that the relevant material was included in the Crown brief, which was provided to the appellant's solicitors before the trial. Accordingly, any submission that the material is fresh evidence, which could now be of assistance to the appellant, must be rejected. 


16Mr Potier says that the decision of the Court was plainly wrong in that respect, being based on a misapprehension of the evidence (which revealed that the Telstra records, as opposed to the Optus records, formed no part of the police brief and indeed were not made available to Mr Potier until after his conviction). He proposes to make an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the decision on that basis, but has not yet done so, for want of a grant of Legal Aid. He expects the Crown to join in the application in light of the alleged misapprehension of the facts: cf Burrell v R [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218 at 92-93, 131. 

17The dismissal of the conviction appeal paved the path for the Crown to rely upon the evidence in the first trial as tendency or coincidence evidence in the second trial. 

Application for a juror to attend to give evidence 

18The first issue in the present application relates to attempts by Mr Potier to secure the attendance of one of the jurors at his first trial to give evidence in respect of his bail application. He submitted that the application accordingly had to be decided as a preliminary issue before the determination of the bail application. 

19Mr Potier alleges, and the Crown evidently accepts, that the juror in question wrote a book about his experience at the trial, changing names and some details of the trial in an attempt (apparently unsuccessful) not to identify the relevant proceedings. Mr Potier submits that the book reveals that the impugned recordings were critical to the jury's deliberations and the verdicts of guilty reached. He submits that, in determining the conviction appeal, this Court will have to consider what impact the fresh evidence (the Telstra records) would have had on the original jury trial for the first two offences. Mr Potier submits, further, that in the unusual circumstances of this case, the Court need not speculate as to that question since there is an opportunity for the Court to hear the ""best evidence"", namely, precisely what the juror in question would have thought about the ""withheld"" evidence. 

20Although the task of this Court under s 22(2) is to determine the application afresh, it is convenient to begin by considering the reasons given by RA Hulme J for its refusal. His Honour held that the application faced a number of insurmountable problems. First, his Honour noted that it is beyond question that it is impermissible for a court to receive evidence as to discussions and deliberations of jurors, citing the judgment of Buddin J in R v Potier [2005] NSWCCA 336 at [12] to [14] (an application by Mr Potier to examine the same juror for the purpose of his conviction appeal following his first trial). 

21Mr Potier submitted that the separate judgment of Basten JA in that case holds that ""there was an ability to call this person"". In my view, that submission derives from a misapprehension as to the import of his Honour's remarks. The Court gave its judgment ex tempore . The first judgment was given by Buddin J. His Honour proposed that the application be refused, for reasons including the proposition, based on well-established principle, that the applicant was not entitled to explore the deliberations of the jury by direct examination of the juror in the witness box (at [14]). 

22Basten JA agreed, stating (at [29]): 

I agree. I would add only these comments. Firstly, there was no challenge to the proposition that it was within the power of the court to require either the juror or the director or both to attend: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), section 12. 

23It is clear, in my view, that his Honour was stating no more than that it was uncontroversial that the Court of Criminal Appeal has power under section 12 to order a compellable witness to attend and be examined before the Court. It is equally clear, in my view, that Basten JA was in agreement with Buddin J that the power should not be exercised in that case because the applicant was not entitled to explore the deliberations of the jury by direct examination of the juror in the witness box. 

24The third Judge of the Court also agreed with Buddin J for the reasons given by his Honour: at [37] per Simpson J. It follows inexorably that RA Hulme J was correct to dismiss the present application for the same reasons. 

25Mr Potier submitted that the protection enjoyed by jurors under Part 9 of the Jury Act 1977 has been given up by the juror in the present case by reason of his having published the book. That assumes that the only object of those provisions is to protect individual jurors. That is undoubtedly one their objects but a broader purpose is served by those provisions in my view, namely, the protection of the integrity of the administration of justice. 

26In any event, Mr Potier's argument does not address the principles applied by RA Hulme J outlined above. 

27His Honour gave two additional reasons for dismissing the application, with which I respectfully agree. First, his Honour said that even if the principles summarised in the judgment of Buddin J were not an insurmountable hurdle, any evidence that Mr Potier could derive from the juror would be of no real value, since the juror would be doing no more than to reconstruct what his own thoughts might have been about an issue he was called upon to consider some nine years ago and guessing what other jurors might have thought about it (at [20]). 

28Secondly, RA Hulme J expressed the view (at [21]), with which I agree, that the thoughts of jurors as to how they might have reacted to some evidence that was not placed before them would be an entirely irrelevant consideration in a conviction appeal based on fresh evidence. As stated by his Honour, the task of the Court of Criminal Appeal in such a case is to make its own assessment of the evidence and to consider what impact it may have had upon the outcome of the trial: Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26; 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259. 

29In my view, for the reasons stated by RA Hulme J, the application for an order requiring the juror to attend to be examined before the Court, whether in respect of the conviction appeal or on the bail application, must be dismissed. 

Application to cross examine a witness in relation to compliance with the order to produce 

30The second order sought by Mr Potier was to compel a witness to attend and be examined as to the adequacy of the compliance by the Commissioner of Police with an order to produce issued on 27 June 2008 at the request of Mr Potier. The order required the Commissioner to produce a certified copy of each original recording made under telephone interception warrants granted in respect of the investigation of suspected offences involving Mr Potier. The Commissioner produced a number of recordings of telephone conversations including four recordings that had not previously been disclosed. 

31A senior technical officer attached to the telecommunications interception branch of the police force provided a statement dated 20 March 2009 in which he said (in effect) that the existence of the additional recordings was explained by the fact that, since the first trial, technical advances have created the ability to retrieve material that was always present on the tapes but previously inaudible or otherwise unable to be retrieved. 

32Mr Potier seeks to cross-examine the officer (or, since that particular officer is no longer with the police force, some other suitable technical officer) as to concerns he has surrounding those events. The issues Mr Potier wished to explore were why it has taken 10 years to produce the additional recordings; the reason for discrepancies between the calls produced and ""web trace"" records of Optus Cable and Wireless; why at an earlier time there was a claim in respect of one of the four recordings that it was ""blank""; why there is a difference in the length of some of the recordings recently produced when compared to those produced at trial; and whether the recordings are not authentic, and if so, how this occurred and who is responsible. 

33As noted by RA Hulme J at [10], it is uncontroversial that a court may compel a witness to attend for examination as to whether there has been proper compliance with an order to produce in an appropriate case. However, the proper occasion for such an order is to test whether there has been proper compliance. Questioning directed to further search and inquiry should not be permitted. 

34It is plain, in my view, that Mr Potier's application seeks to question the witness (or a like expert) for the purpose of obtaining evidence for use at the hearing of the conviction appeal (and possibly the bail application). No basis has been established for doubting that the order to produce was understood and has been properly complied with. 

35The order I propose is that the applications be dismissed. 

36SCHMIDT J: I agree with McCallum J.

		28 July 2011",2011-07-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757466,Lee v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 169,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : The applicant, Michael Lee, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him by Price J for murder: R v Lee [2010] NSWSC 632. He alleges that the sentence was manifestly excessive and, in comparison with that imposed on his co-offender failed to reflect his significantly lower level of culpability: c.f. R v Wong [2010] NSWSC 171 (Buddin J). 

2This Court has recently commented on the undesirability of co-offenders being sentenced by different judges: see Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67 at [42]-[47], Johnson J (Whealy JA and Hidden J agreeing) . Sometimes that course is unavoidable, in practical terms, but in the present case, each co-offender pleaded guilty and they were sentenced within three months of each other in the Supreme Court at Sydney. In the result, this Court has been called upon to make a careful comparison of the judgment on sentence in each matter. In relation to the co-offender, findings of fact must be taken as given: in relation to the applicant, there are challenges to particular findings of fact made in respect of him. 

3The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 years, 3 months and a balance of term of 6 years. The overall sentence was, therefore, 19 years and 3 months. The applicant was arrested in the early hours of 20 March 2008 and his sentence was backdated to commence on that date. He is presently eligible to be released on parole on 19 June 2021. 

4The co-offender, Mr Ivan Wong, received a non-parole period in respect of the murder charge of 14 years, with a balance of term of 5.5 years. 

5In the course of the fracas described below, Mr Wong, who had a knife, also wounded another man. He pleaded guilty to a separate count of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment, being a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and a balance of 1 year 6 months. The sentence for murder was accumulated on 18 months of the sentence for wounding. 

Factual background 
6The relevant facts may be stated shortly. The sentencing proceeded on the basis of a set of agreed facts which are set out by his Honour in his judgment at [6] and accepted by his Honour for the purpose of sentencing: at [16]. His Honour made some additional findings to which specific reference will be made below. 

7Mr Wong telephoned the applicant on the evening of 19 March 2008 from Hungry Jacks restaurant in George Street, Sydney. Mr Wong apparently believed that one of a group of three young Korean men had ""stared at him"" at the restaurant. He rang the applicant on his mobile telephone, saying ""Fight, come over to Hungry Jacks"". When he arrived at the restaurant, the applicant spoke to Mr Wong and then telephoned a female acquaintance, requesting her to bring him a hammer, which she did shortly thereafter, wrapped in a paper bag. 

8The applicant and the co-offender did not confront the three Korean men at Hungry Jacks, but followed them after they left and accosted them in the World Square Shopping Centre, at a short distance from the restaurant. 

9The verbal exchange was initiated by the applicant, who called upon one of the Korean men, Mr Song, to ""show some respect"" and apologise to Mr Wong for staring at him. Mr Song apologised. The applicant then showed the men Mr Wong's hand, in which he was carrying a knife with the blade open and showed the handle of the hammer in the paper bag, which he was carrying. In respect of each, he said, ""You don't see this"". 

10After the applicant had inquired whether the men were Korean, Mr Wong suddenly raised the knife and stabbed Mr Song in the chest. The Korean men backed away, as did the applicant, but Mr Wong again swung the knife in their direction. They fled, one, Mr Joon Yup Lee, leaving in a different direction from Mr Song and the third man. The applicant and Mr Wong chased Mr Lee, though why they did so does not appear from the agreed facts or the evidence. 

11Mr Lee slipped and fell, allowing the applicant to catch up with him and attempt to hit him with the hammer. The hammer slipped from his grasp and neither the agreed facts nor the evidence suggested that he caused any significant injury with the hammer. The applicant was grappling with Mr Lee, who was on the ground, when within a matter of seconds, Mr Wong caught up with them and stabbed Mr Lee four times, one wound to the left anterior chest proving fatal. Mr Lee attempted to rise, but the applicant picked up the hammer and struck him, causing him to fall back. Mr Lee then got up and was able to run from the scene. 

12In his evidence on sentence, the applicant agreed that he had been ""holding and scuffling with Mr Lee when Mr Wong arrived"": Judgment at [15]. In respect of the applicant's role at that stage, the trial judge found at [19]: 

""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was being held by the offender immediately before the stabbing. The CCTV footage does not establish that the offender was holding the deceased when he was stabbed. As a consequence of the offender's conduct, the deceased was not able to defend himself against being stabbed four times with a knife by the co-offender."" 

Issues on leave application 
13The applicant sought, in 18 grounds of appeal, to identify separately precise aspects of the sentencing process which were said to reveal error. Although it is often unhelpful for an applicant to simply state that a sentence is manifestly excessive (or manifestly inadequate), on one view the present notice errs in the opposite direction. There were, in effect, four primary bases of challenge. 

14First, issue was taken with his Honour's finding that the applicant's level of culpability was ""not significantly less"" than that of Mr Wong: at [27]. That was the basis of the submission that there was insufficient differentiation between the sentences: grounds 1 and 3. There should be a grant of leave to raise these grounds. 

15Secondly, there was a challenge to his Honour's conclusion as to where, on a scale of objective seriousness for murder, this particular offence lay. In that respect, there was a specific challenge to the finding that the applicant had ""facilitated"" the murder of Mr Lee and to a failure to find that the applicant's liability was to be assessed on the basis of ""extended common purpose"": grounds 2 and 4. In addition, his Honour was said to have erred in treating as aggravating circumstances the use of a weapon and the commission of the offence in company: grounds 5, 6 and 17. It also appears to have been assumed that the finding that there was ""a limited degree of planning"" (at [23]) was adverse to the applicant: ground 14. These grounds lack substance. 

16Thirdly, there were a number of grounds which alleged that his Honour had given ""no or insufficient weight"" to particular mitigating circumstances: grounds 7-13. However, it appeared in the course of argument that the underlying rationale of these grounds was that a failure to give sufficient weight to such matters, whilst not revealed on the face of the reasons, was an available explanation for the allegedly excessive sentence: ground 18. They are available (though not in substance separate grounds) and also permit a grant of leave to appeal. 

17Fourthly, his Honour was said to have erred in assessing the degree of departure from the statutory proportion between non-parole period and the balance of the term, having made a finding of special circumstances, for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act ""). This was as much a challenge to the length of the non-parole period, as to the period as a proportion of the sentence; nevertheless, it is appropriate to grant leave in respect of these grounds 15 and 16. This challenge formed part of the general claim of manifest excess. 

Objective circumstances of offence 
18It is convenient to start with the specific challenge to his Honour's primary fact-finding, namely the conclusion that the applicant ""facilitated"" the murder of Mr Lee by the co-offender. After noting that Buddin J, in sentencing Mr Wong, had described the murder as ""brutal and senseless"", his Honour continued at [27]: 

""Whilst it is true that if the co-offender had not wielded the knife in the way that he did, the deceased would not have been killed, the offender's role in the commission of the offence was not insubstantial. His violence towards the deceased facilitated the murder."" 

19The submission that the applicant ""had a very minor role"", is untenable. Whether Mr Lee would have escaped if he had not slipped, is a matter of speculation. However, having slipped, his Honour correctly found that the applicant kicked him, attempted to hit him with the hammer and was holding and scuffling with him when Mr Wong arrived. The conclusion that the applicant had deliberately and effectively prevented Mr Lee's escape was justified on the evidence. His conduct was appropriately described as ""facilitating"" the attack on Mr Lee. The murder was the consequence of the attack. 

20The second element of the challenge was, in substance, an extension of that just discussed. Having described the applicant as having facilitated the murder, his Honour concluded that the applicant had ""an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm"": at [27]. The complaint was that the applicant was sentenced on the basis that he himself had an intention sufficient to satisfy the mental element of murder, instead of ""extended common purpose"", which was all that the law required in respect of joint criminal enterprises. 

21Precisely what was meant by reliance on the concept of ""extended common purpose"", in this context, is unclear. The problems caused by the use of terminology, having roots in past distinctions which are no longer relevant, have been noted on more than one occasion: see, for recent discussions, Likiardopolous v The Queen [2010] VSCA 344 at [46]-[75] (Buchanan, Ashley and Tate JJA) and Arafan v The Queen [2010] VSCA 356 (Maxwell P and Wineberg JA) at [24]-[34]. The 'extension' referred to in that phrase is addressed to the situation where the crime charged was not comprehended by the understanding or arrangement, whether express or tacit, between the offenders, but was an act foreseen by the accused as an incidental crime which might be committed, combined with continued participation in the criminal venture: McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 117. Unlike Johns v The Queen [1980] HCA 3; 143 CLR 108, where the concept was applied, the applicant was present at the scene of the crime committed by Mr Wong. Further, it was open to his Honour to find that the infliction of grievous bodily harm, at least on Mr Song, was conduct within the arrangement or agreement, in which both offenders participated. 

22It is beyond doubt that he was sentenced for his part in a joint criminal enterprise. He was not, however, sentenced as the principal who inflicted the fatal wound on Mr Lee. That does not mean that his own mental state was irrelevant. His primary complaint, as to the relative sentence as compared with Mr Wong, is itself premised on the assumption that parties to a joint criminal enterprise may be sentenced disparately, taking into account the level of responsibility and personal circumstances of each. His Honour's conclusion that both the applicant and Mr Wong acted ""impulsively"" in chasing Mr Lee may, as the applicant submitted, be inconsistent with an agreement to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Lee, but his Honour made no such finding. The actual finding in respect of the mental state of the applicant was justified by his own conduct in chasing and attacking Mr Lee with a hammer. 

23In effect, the adverse objective circumstances of the case were as follows: 

(a) although the initiative came from Mr Wong, the applicant willingly associated himself with Mr Wong and armed himself for whatever might eventuate; 

(b) the applicant was clearly aware that the circumstances of Mr Wong's complaint were directed primarily (or solely) at Mr Song and not Mr Lee, and hardly warranted the attack which followed; 

(c) it was the applicant who initiated the confrontation with the three Korean men; 

(d) it was the applicant who led the chase after Mr Lee as he ran away; 

(e) it was the applicant who first attacked Mr Lee and continued to hold and scuffle with him until Mr Wong arrived; 

(f) the applicant sought to continue his attack on Mr Lee after he had been stabbed by Mr Wong. 

24A number of factors of aggravation were rejected by the sentencing judge. First, he rejected a suggestion on the part of the prosecution that the attack was racially motivated: at [20]-[22]. Secondly, he rejected a prosecution submission that the offence was part of a ""planned criminal activity"", concluding at [23]: 

""Whilst the evidence establishes that there was a limited degree of planning, I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that the murder was part of a planned criminal activity. It seems to me that the offender's conduct after the stabbing of Mr Song, mainly arose impulsively."" 

25This finding, read in context, was favourable to the applicant. The challenge to the finding (ground 14) is without substance. There was undisputed evidence of the meeting at Hungry Jacks; each, to the knowledge of the other, was carrying a weapon, and the confrontation with Mr Song was planned as part of the ostensible purpose which led the applicant and Mr Wong to confront the three Korean men. The acts which followed, constituting the brutal and senseless attack on the unarmed and unoffending Mr Lee, were not, his Honour held, specifically planned. 

26Three further grounds of appeal complain that his Honour accepted as circumstances of aggravation the fact that the activity involved the use of a weapon and that it was carried out in company (grounds 5, 6 and 17). The suggestion that these were indeed not circumstances of aggravation required a rejection of his Honour's statement that neither was ""in dispute"": at [24]. The substance of the ground was that they were double-counted, as elements of the objective circumstances and as aggravating factors (ground 17). 

27There is no doubt that s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act is apt to give rise to awkwardness in writing judgments on sentence. Further, it is well understood that there is a risk of double-counting where a particular aggravating factor identified in s 21A(2) is also an element of the offence. Most of the factors listed in s 21A(2) will, if applicable, be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. Because a sentencing judge refers to them explicitly as aggravating factors, does not mean that there has been double-counting. There was nothing in his Honour's reasons to suggest that double-counting occurred in the present case. 

Mitigating factors 
28The first complaint as to factors of mitigation relates to the discount given for the plea of guilty. A plea was taken only on the second day fixed for the trial (although agreement had been reached on the first day) and the sentencing judge discounted the sentence by 12.5%. There was some ambivalence in the applicant's submissions as to whether that was to be treated as an inadequate discount, or was inadequate when compared with that accorded Mr Wong (namely, 20%) for a plea upon arraignment. The safer course is to accept that both issues were being raised. However, on their face, neither discount was inappropriate in the circumstances of each case. According to the sentencing judge, counsel for the applicant did not submit that each discount should have been same, as Mr Wong had entered a plea upon his arraignment, having waived his right to a committal hearing: R v Wong at [31], referred to by the sentencing judge at [38]. 

29The applicant's late plea undoubtedly had utilitarian value, as his Honour accepted. The case in favour of a greater discount was based on two factors. The first was that the applicant had confessed his part in the criminal activity and co-operated with police, including undertaking a ""walk through"" of the crime scene, immediately upon arrest. Secondly, it was submitted that the reason for the delay in entering a formal plea resulted from the original charges including attempted murder of Mr Song and a charge of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Song. It was only when agreement was reached to abandon the serious charges in respect of Mr Song that the applicant agreed to plead guilty to the charge of murdering Mr Lee. 

30In concluding that a lesser discount was appropriate in relation to the applicant, the sentencing judge stated at [38]: 

""The reasons advanced for the delay in the plea are largely irrelevant as the utilitarian value of the delayed plea was less. ... There is, in my opinion, a significant difference in the utilitarian value of a plea entered upon arraignment and a plea offered on the second day of the time allocated for trial. The utilitarian value of the Agreed Facts was reduced as agreement was not reached until 10 May 2010. I accept that there has been a significant saving in court time and the trial may have involved difficult issues of accessorial liability."" 

31The approach adopted by the trial judge is entirely within the scope of the guidelines given in R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at [155] (Spigelman CJ). It is possible, that in some circumstances there may be a concern as to the reasonableness of expecting an early plea where an indictment has been overladen with charges which could not reasonably be expected to proceed to trial, but which the prosecution has declined to withdraw. There was no such suggestion in the present case and, as the sentencing judge noted, there was no evidence of an offer to plead guilty to the murder at an earlier stage, on the basis that other charges would be withdrawn or reduced. The disparity in discounts was warranted by the differing circumstances of the two offenders. 

32The other factors which it was argued were either not taken into account at all or were given insufficient weight were expressions of contrition and remorse; previous good character; absence of significant criminal convictions; assistance to police and pre-trial disclosure; unlikelihood that the applicant would re-offend and the good prospects of rehabilitation: grounds 8-13. There was clearly a degree of overlap between these complaints and, all these matters being mentioned by the sentencing judge, it was not possible to contend that any one was entirely neglected: indeed, the language of the grounds of appeal reflects closely the factors identified in the judgment on sentence at [31]-[35]. It is not necessary to repeat that discussion here. If the complaint has substance, it is because, for some reason which does not appear from the judgment itself, the overall effect of taking these factors into account was to reduce the sentence by an inadequate amount. 

33Viewed independently, the complaint lacks substance; the sentence was not manifestly excessive. Whether there was inadequate reflection of the differing levels of culpability of the applicant and Mr Wong is a matter addressed below. 

Adjustment of sentence for special circumstances 
34The last matter of specific complaint concerned the adjustment for special circumstances. Absent a finding as to special circumstances, his Honour would have been obliged to impose a balance of the term of sentence which did not exceed one-third of the non-parole period: Sentencing Procedure Act , s 44(2). If one assumes that the period of mandatory custody was an appropriate length, then the balance of the term, without adjustment, should not have exceeded 4 years and 5 months. Approaching it from the other end, if a total sentence period of 19 years, 3 months was appropriate, the non-parole period should have been not less than 14 years, 5 months. Of course, his Honour need not have undertaken either calculation, but they indicate the range of variation from the statutory norm. There was in fact a slightly greater variation than in Mr Wong's case, he having received a non-parole period of 14 years for the murder with a balance of sentence of 5 years, 6 months. Nevertheless, the level of variation may not reflect the individual circumstances of the two offenders adequately. This assessment can best be made in the context of the overall comparison required by grounds 1, 3 and 18. 

Whether disparity appropriate 
35The equal treatment of co-offenders requires both that those similarly placed be treated equally and that those subject to material and relevant differences should be treated differently: see Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610-611 (Mason J) and 617 (Brennan J); OM v R [2009] NSWCCA 267 at [7]. In the present case, the applicant received a somewhat lighter sentence than his co-offender. The contention is that objectively viewed, the disparity should have been greater. 

36The factors which tended to place the applicant in a similar position to Mr Wong in respect of culpability have been set out at [23] above. There were other factors which tended to set their respective circumstances apart. These were: 

(a) the aggression was instigated by Mr Wong; 

(b) Mr Wong wielded the knife by which the fatal injury was inflicted; 

(c) Mr Wong was on conditional liberty in relation to other charges at the time of the offence; 

(d) the applicant had better prospects of rehabilitation and a lower likelihood of re-offending. 

37The applicant complained that his Honour's assessment of his culpability for the murder as being ""not significantly less than"" that of Mr Wong did not adequately reflect the role of each. In Mr Wong's case, Buddin J had assessed the offence as ""falling below, but only slightly below, the 'middle of the range of objective seriousness'"": R v Wong at [36]. His Honour made a similar finding without the qualification: at [27]. 

38Language referring to ""the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" is taken from s 54A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act , where it is used to characterise the case in which a standard non-parole period is applicable. Differing views have been expressed as to the relevance of a standard non-parole period, once the Court has determined that it is not, in the circumstances of the case, applicable: see, eg, R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [122]; followed in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 (Simpson J); cf at [41]-[50] (Adams J). In the present case, nothing turns on the use of the language of s 54A, so long as appropriate weight has been given to the mitigating circumstances which were clearly treated as not falling within the assessment of ""culpability"". 

39In assessing the relationship between the offences, it must be remembered that the apparent equivalence of the sentences (19 years, 6 months for Mr Wong and 19 years, 3 months for the applicant) is partly accounted for by the different discounts for their pleas of guilty. Allowing for the discounts, the starting point for Mr Wong's sentence was 24 years, 4.5 months and for the applicant, 22 years. The disparity is then seen to be greater, but the applicant's sentence is less than 10% below that of Mr Wong. Given the factors differentiating the two, in my view that difference is manifestly too low. 

40As explained by the sentencing judge in the present matter, in respect of Mr Wong at [43]: 

""The co-offender had been placed on a bond and on two periods of probation for these offences by the Children's Court. At the time of the murder, the co-offender was subject to three kinds of conditional liberty which in his case was a significant factor of aggravation."" 

41The respondent contended on the appeal that limited weight should be given to the fact that Mr Wong committed the offence while on conditional liberty, because the matters for which he was on conditional liberty were relatively minor offences, not involving personal violence. This contention should be rejected. The underlying offences were factors to be taken into account, as in fact they were, in relation to Mr Wong's minor criminal record for offences of dishonesty: R v Wong at [28]. It may be that the breach would have been more serious if the offences for which he was on conditional liberty were similar to those committed in the present case, but the mere fact of conditional liberty is, as the sentencing judge noted, a significant factor of aggravation. The question for present purposes is whether that, and the other factors, were adequately taken into account in assessing the proper sentence for the applicant. 

42One further factor which arises, partly perhaps because of the unfortunate procedural history in these two matters, is that Mr Wong was sentenced on the basis that it was the applicant who brought ""the weapons"", a phrase which must include the knife, to the scene: R v Wong at [30]. That was not the basis upon which the applicant came to be sentenced: rather, there was at least an implicit finding that it was Mr Wong who had the knife at all relevant times: the applicant only obtained the hammer: Agreed Facts, set out at [6] and [15]. 

Conclusions 
43As noted earlier, the applicant should be granted leave to appeal. Although some grounds lack substance, there is no purpose in limiting the terms of the grant, assuming there is power to do so. 

44The submission that the difference between the sentences imposed on the applicant and Mr Wong failed adequately to reflect their differing levels of culpability and the different findings in respect of rehabilitation should be accepted. The applicant should be resentenced. In undertaking that task, all the matters relied on by the primary judge, except those specifically qualified above, should be taken into account. It is also necessary to have regard to the fact that the applicant was youthful at the time of the offence, having turned 18 years only 4 months earlier. As noted by Buddin J in sentencing Mr Wong, some allowance must be made for immaturity and the importance of rehabilitation: see, eg, Regina v AEM (Snr) [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[98] (Beazley JA, Wood CJ at CL, Sully J). 

45In Wong , Buddin J noted that an offender's youth ""cannot simply be used as a 'cloak of convenience'"", by which I understand is meant a cloak for leniency. The age of majority is not to be treated as a bright line dividing maturity from something less; nor does the seriousness of the offence totally preclude considerations deriving from youthfulness. Such factors are points on a scale; the applicant committed one of the most serious offences under the law, when over 18 years, but only just. 

46In my view, the starting point for the applicant's sentence, taking account of that imposed on his co-offender, should have been 20 years. Applying the discount accepted by the sentencing judge and a similar (though not identical) proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of the term, the appropriate non-parole period is 12 years and 3 months, with a balance of term of 5 years 3 months. The sentence imposed should be set aside and the applicant should be re-sentenced accordingly. 

47Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 

(1) Grant the applicant leave to appeal against the sentence for murder imposed on him by Price J on 18 June 2010. 

(2) Allow the appeal and set aside the sentence. 

(3) Sentence Michael Lee for the murder of Joon Yup Lee to imprisonment for - 

(a) a non-parole period of 12 years and 3 months, taken to have commenced on 20 March 2008 and expiring on 19 June 2020, 
(b) with a balance of the term of 5 years 3 months, commencing on 20 June 2020 and expiring on 19 September 2025, 

the term of the sentence being 17 years and 6 months. 

(4) Specify the earliest date upon which it appears to the Court that the applicant will be eligible for parole as 20 June 2020. 

48RS HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Basten J. His Honour has set out the relevant facts and I accordingly I can be brief. 

49I agree with his Honour that Price J did not err in finding that the Applicant ""facilitated"" the murder of Mr Lee, and had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, and that there was no double counting in Price J's identification of the aggravating factors of use of a weapon and the offence being committed in company. I agree also that there is no validity in the Applicant's complaints so far as the discount for his or Wong's pleas of guilty are concerned. 

50Section 54A et seq. of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provide that unless there are reasons for not doing so a court is to impose on a person who commits an offence of murder that falls into the middle of the range of objective seriousness, a non-parole period of 20 years. If the proportions envisaged by s 44 of that Act were followed, a 20 years non-parole period would correspond with a total sentence of 26 years and 8 months. 

51When regard is had to the 12 discount allowed to the Applicant for his plea, the sentence imposed of 19 years and 3 months accords with a pre-discount sentence of 22 years, only 4 years and 8 months or 17% less than that appropriate for an offence falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness committed by an offender whose subjective circumstances do not call for some amelioration of such a sentence. 

52In my view the circumstances of the offence and of the Applicant called for a greater difference than this 4 years and 8 months. The principal factors leading me to that conclusion are as follows:- 

(i) There was no intention to kill; 

(ii) There was little premeditation; 

(iii) The Applicant was not the principal offender even though, as Price J concluded, his culpability was not significantly less than that of the principal offender, Wong; 

(iv) The Applicant exhibited remorse and an acceptance of responsibility for his offending; 

(v) The Applicant was found to be of prior good character; 

(vi) Price J found that the Applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend; 

(vii) The Applicant was not yet aged 18 at the time of the offence. 

53Price J said that he gave this last mentioned factor modest weight, a view with which I agree. As was said in Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at [25], ""Where ... immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years."" However, as was also contemplated in that case, it takes no great maturity to appreciate that bringing weapons such as knives and hammers into physical confrontations infringes the rights of others in a way that no civilized society can tolerate. I can accept, as Price J did, that the Applicant's youth may have been a contributing factor to his offending. However, even 18 year olds must know that blows with hammers or knives are capable of serious injury. While in light of the matters listed above, personal deterrence, rehabilitation and protection of society do not demand a sentence of the length often imposed for murder, general deterrence and retribution must be given weight. 

54In arriving at the conclusion I have I do not ignore the fact that there were factors tending to aggravate the Applicant's offence - that it was committed in company and involved the use of a weapon, indeed two weapons, that were procured with the prospect of use in a fight. There was also to be taken into account a Form 1 offence of assault constituted by displaying the knife Wong had to a third member of the victim's group. 

55Thus the conclusion at which I have arrived is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. I am not sure that I would have arrived at the same conclusion if the only comparison was with the maximum penalty of life imprisonment but the finer guidepost or reference point provided by the standard non-parole period leads me to the view that Price J's nominal starting point of 22 years was not only too high but appellably so. 

56I am also of the view that the notional commencing point of the Applicant's sentence was high by comparison with the notional commencing point for the sentence imposed on Wong. After adding back the discount of 20% for the latter's plea, the notional starting point for his sentence of 19 years becomes 24.375 years. Yet disadvantages that Wong suffered from and the Applicant did not included that Wong was the principal aggressor, deliberately wielding a weapon far more calculated to inflict death than the hammer used (to a limited degree) by the Applicant. Wong also was on conditional liberty pursuant to three separate bonds imposed as incidents of three separate previous sentences. Numerous authorities have laid down that offending on conditional liberty is a seriously aggravating circumstance. Wong had a criminal record and was an abuser of illicit drugs. Arguing in the opposite direction was the fact that Wong would seem to have had a somewhat more traumatic childhood than had the Applicant. There were other less significant differences. 

57Successful appeals on parity grounds require that there be a ""marked"" difference in sentences. My mind has vacillated on the question whether the less than 2 years difference in notional starting points can, having regard to the differences in the circumstances of the two offenders be so described but ultimately I have come to the view that it can. Thus on this ground also, I would allow the appeal. 

58I agree with Basten JA that an appropriate starting point in the determination of the Applicant's sentence is 20 years. When to this figure the discount of 12% for the Applicant's plea is taken into account the result is 17 years. Considerations of parity and proportionality with the sentence imposed on Wong justify the non-parole period being reduced below the proportion specified in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and accordingly I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA. 

59HIDDEN J : To reflect the difference in culpability of co-offenders in the sentences passed upon them is a difficult discretionary task. It is only after careful consideration that I agree that the sentence passed upon the applicant does not adequately distinguish his criminality from that of Mr Wong. I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and with his Honour's reasons

2757469,Cohen v R [2011] NSWCCA 165,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P: I agree with Simpson J. 

2SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Dubbo on 20 September 2010, following his pleas of guilty to two counts on an indictment. 

3The first count was of aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence and, pursuant s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Pursuant to Part 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") a standard non-parole period of 5 years is prescribed (for offences in the mid-range of objective gravity). The ""serious indictable offence"" was larceny. The circumstance of aggravation was that the offence was committed in company (see Crimes Act s 105A). The second count on the indictment was of intentionally causing damage to property by fire (arson). Pursuant to s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act , that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. No standard non-parole period is prescribed. Both offences were committed on 27 September 2009. 

4Having heard the evidence, Woods ADCJ sentenced the applicant. For the arson offence, he imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years, commencing on 21 July 2010, with a non-parole period of 3 years. For the aggravated break enter and steal offence, he imposed a partially accumulated (by one year) sentence of imprisonment for 5 years, commencing on 21 July 2011, with a non-parole period of 3 years. The aggregate sentence was therefore of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 

The Facts 

5The facts were put before the sentencing judge by way of an agreed statement. There was also a Victim Impact Statement. In addition, some evidence given by the applicant threw some additional light upon the circumstances of the offences. The facts can be reduced to a relatively simple outline. 

6The applicant, who was then 19 years of age, lived with his mother, younger brother and sister, aunt and cousin at an address in east Dubbo, in close proximity to the Buninyong primary school, which the applicant had attended. 

727 September 2009 was a Sunday. Although the time of the offences is not clear from the materials, it appears that they were committed at night. The applicant, with his younger brother (15 years of age) following him, went to the Buninyong school, and broke into one of the school blocks. He stole property, which included, at least, two data projectors, a digital camera, a DVD player with remote control, a projector pole and a laptop computer. 

8During the course of his activities in one of the classrooms, the applicant injured or cut himself, causing bleeding onto the carpet. He appreciated that the blood could be used to identify him; he therefore lit a fire to destroy the bloodstain. This, of course, was the arson offence. 

9It was the applicant's intention merely to damage that part of the property onto which he had bled. However, the fire burned out of his control and caused immense damage - the building block was considered to be damaged beyond repair. A provisional estimate of the cost of rebuilding was $2 million. The contents of the building destroyed were valued at ""up to"" $250,000. Other consequential costs were incurred, such as costs of hiring and siting temporary classrooms, bringing the total estimated loss caused by the fire to between $2,350,000 and $2,500,000. There were also individual and personal costs. Six teachers lost personal teaching resources (some irreplaceable) that they had collected, as well as personal items of property. Some pupils' property was destroyed. 

10The school was classified as a ""low socio-economic"" school; sixty-four percent of its pupils were Aboriginal. Many of the pupils came from disadvantaged backgrounds. The principal of the school who prepared the Victim Impact Statement on behalf of the ""school community"" wrote of how ""soul destroying"" and ""devastating"" it had been to witness the fire when she was called to the school at 1:30am on 28 September. She said that staff were ""gutted to see all their and their students hard work go up in smoke"". She described it (fairly) as ""an absolute senseless waste"". She said that observing the aftermath of the fire, including the results of the Fire Brigade's efforts to control it, and police investigation, was distressing for many pupils. 

11The applicant surrendered himself to police on 1 October 2009. He remained in custody until sentencing for these offences. However, two months later, on 9 November he was dealt with in the Children's Court in respect of an offence of aggravated break enter and steal, and one of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty, committed on 18 April 2008, and in respect of which the applicant was at liberty on bail. A control order of 13 months, commencing on 9 November 2009, with a non-parole period of 9 months and 23 days expiring on 31 October 2010, was imposed. Notwithstanding that the applicant surrendered himself, he did not enter a plea of guilty until the day on which the charges were listed for trial. The reason for that is not apparent. 

The Applicant's Personal Circumstances 

12Both the applicant and his mother gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. A pre-sentence report was before the Court. 

13As I have indicated, the applicant was 19 years of age at the time of the offences - just 19 and 1 month. He is of Aboriginal heritage. He was raised in Dubbo, and attended the school that he subsequently burned. His father left home when he was a baby and he has had little contact with him. However, he is said (by the author of the pre-sentence report) to have had a stable and supportive family environment and maintains a close relationship with his mother, who works as a nursing assistant at a local aged care centre. I would regard with some scepticism the assessment of a stable and supportive family environment; his mother gave evidence that, while she is now in regular employment, sixteen years ago she underwent rehabilitation herself and three of her other children have recently had encounters with the law. 

14Because of the problems his mother had earlier had, her own mother played a significant role in the upbringing of the applicant. She died in 2008, leaving the applicant with unresolved grief and loss issues. 

15At the time of the offences, the applicant had been in a relationship as a result of which a daughter (2 years of age at the time of sentencing) was born. It appears that this relationship had terminated at or about the time of the offences. His former partner has maintained regular contact with the applicant during his incarceration. 

16The applicant completed year 9 and left school, and has not undertaken any further training, nor held any paid employment. 

17He gave some conflicting information to the author of the pre-sentence report. He denied problematic alcohol consumption, and said that, although he had used cannabis while at school, he had ceased its use because he did not like its effect on him. Notwithstanding this, he said that, at about the time of the offences, he had used cannabis, and that he had been intoxicated to a point where he had no recollection of what he had done. 

18The applicant has a limited criminal record, predominantly for motor vehicle offences, including two of driving whilst never having held a licence to do so. There is also the offence of aggravated break enter and steal for which, in the Children's Court, in November 2009, he was subjected to the control order I have mentioned above. He had in fact been at liberty on bail in respect of these offences at the time of the offences. 

19In his evidence, the applicant expressed his remorse for the damage he had caused, and recognised that this extended to the stress imposed on teachers and pupils, and impacted upon their education and the community generally. While in custody he has undertaken some educational courses. He said that, at the time of the offences, he had personal issues, such as the termination of the relationship with his girlfriend, and also disagreements with his mother. 

20The applicant's mother confirmed much of what had been contained in the pre-sentence report, and said that she was considering relocating from Dubbo when the applicant is released. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

21The sentencing judge recounted the facts of the offences and the applicant's personal circumstances. Having regard to the manner in which the grounds of the application are framed, it is convenient to set out some passages from the Remarks. 

22With respect to the aggravated break enter and steal offence, his Honour said: 

""The first offence of break enter and steal is regarded as a very serious offence by the law and the community. Whether it is the break and enter of a house or a commercial or public premises, there is still a great deal of cost and loss to the community and the community is always calling for stronger measures to punish wrongdoers and deter possible offenders. 

Then the initial offence is added to by the even greater damage and loss caused by the fire. Crimes like this do cost the community both in the need for more community resources to be spent on law and order and the cost to individual victims in the cases of household stealings and business for the loss and damage to their property. 

In this case the premises was a major public institution, a school, of major importance to members of the community and the total loss to the community is estimated to be well over $2 million. These offences of course would have a wide range of circumstances. It can be said that a break and enter of a house where people are residing may be more serious than a break and enter of a public building, however it is not just a public building, it is a school and the theft of teaching aids and equipment in which the larger community has serious interest and concern and could be of critical importance to the daily education needs of many children."" (emphasis added) 

23Later, in the context of considering the extent to which rehabilitation ought be taken into account, and whether any sentence other than imprisonment could properly be imposed, he said: 

""However such a deliberate break and enter in such a public building to steal essential material for personal gain and then the lighting of a fire which in his words got out of control and then did so much damage does raise these offences into a level of extreme seriousness which must warrant a condign punishment of imprisonment."" 

24In respect of the arson offence, his Honour said: 

""And then, whilst the same could be raised in the situation of damage by fire, that fire in a private home where people are sleeping has a serious risk of loss of life yet the destruction of school buildings by fire only involves the destruction of property and no risk to human life, yet it again must be of serious concern to the wider community with the loss of essential public assets. As I have noted, I have a statement from the principal of the school which notes the effect of the loss on the teachers and students of the school and much of that loss would be incalculable, such as the loss of personal possessions and records."" 

He found that offence to be ""at a high level of objective seriousness"". 

25His Honour recognised that, by reason of the applicant's plea of guilty to the aggravated break enter and steal count, the standard non-parole period did not strictly apply: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA131; 60 NSWLR 168, and that he retained a general sentencing discretion. 

26He expressed reservations about the degree of the applicant's rehabilitation, having regard to the earlier offence in respect of which he was on bail at the time of the present offences. 

27He found the aggravated break enter and steal offence to be at the mid-range of objective seriousness and considered the appropriate starting point to be a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years (head sentence) which he reduced, by reason of the plea of guilty, to 5 years, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. That represents a reduction of 16 percent. Given that the plea of guilty came at a late stage, no complaint could be (nor is) made about the extent of the reduction. 

28The judge turned to consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances which are required, by s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, to be taken into account. He said: 

""I must have regard to the provisions of [the Sentencing Procedure Act] and in particular to s 21A, aggravating and mitigating factors. In considering aggravating factors I must not double count factors which are in fact in effect elements of the charge. Being in company is an aggravating element in the actual charge. The incident may not have been the result of a long term deliberate plan, but to break and enter such a public institution as a public school and steal such equipment for personal gain was a deliberate act. 

It was clearly a deliberate act by the offender. He may have been drinking but what he did that night still involved deliberate decision and understanding what he was doing. I note what the offender has said, that he did not think it would all burn. It is all very well saying something like that but he did deliberately light the fire. By its nature, fire is an inherently dangerous act and as already noted, the destruction caused extreme dislocation and even disturbance amongst the people who relied upon that school. 

Whilst he did state that he did not intend to do so much damage, he only wanted to remove the evidence of the bloodstain ... as I have already said, any fire in such a situation must always be seen as inherently dangerous. There was an intention to damage by fire, so he must be held responsible for the full extent of what happened. I do find that the damage by fire offence of a school building must be placed at the upper level of objective seriousness."" 

29Finally, his Honour considered how to structure the sentences. He noted that the offences were separate, only related ""because one followed the other in a continuum."" He then said: 

""However on the totality for a young person of his age I will consider some concurrency and then an appropriate period on parole to allow for such a young person to rehabilitate into the community."" 

30In resect of the arson offence, to which no standard non-parole period applies, and which, anomalously enough, carries a maximum penalty of only half that of the aggravated break enter and steal, his Honour fixed a starting point of 5 years, which he reduced by reason of the plea of guilty, to 4 years - a reduction of 20 percent. (That, in my opinion, was generous, bearing in mind the late stage at which the plea was entered). 

31His Honour then imposed the sentences I have outlined above. 

The Grounds of the Application 

32The grounds of the application are pleaded as follows: 

""Ground 1: His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the aggravated break, enter and steal matter contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in rejecting s 21A(3)(b) [of the Sentencing Procedure Act] as a mitigating factor. 

Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to consider special circumstances properly or at all. 

Ground 4: The sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive."" 

At the hearing of the application, Ground 3 was amended to read: 

""His Honour erred by: 

a) Failing to make a finding of special circumstances and recording a reason for that decision in accordance with s 44 [of the Sentencing Procedure Act]. 

b) Failing to make an appropriate allowance for special circumstances."" 

Ground 1: Objective Seriousness of Aggravated Break Enter and Steal 

33As mentioned above, his Honour found that this offence was at the mid-range of objective seriousness. This, it was argued, was unwarranted. 

34In order to comply with the dictates of Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 , it was necessary separately and objectively to evaluate the seriousness of this offence, uninfluenced by the dramatic circumstances of the arson offence. Compartmentalisation was essential. 

35As I understand the argument put on behalf of the applicant, two points were made about the manner in which his Honour dealt with the assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence. 

36The first was the apparent juxtaposition of his observations concerning that offence, with those concerning the arson offence (see the emphasised passages in the extracts in para [22] above). In doing so, it was suggested, his Honour impermissibly, in evaluating the assessment of the objective seriousness of the break and enter offence, allowed himself to be influenced by the far greater objective seriousness of the arson offence. Counsel for the applicant pointed to the passage, extracted above, in which his Honour said: 

""Then the initial offence is added to by the even greater damage and loss caused by the fire..."" 

and the later reference to the loss caused by the fire. That was repeated in the later passage extracted above at [23]. 

37These passages are open to the interpretation placed upon them. However, that is not the only interpretation, and it may be that his Honour was merely having regard to the question of totality. It cannot be that the break enter and steal offence was aggravated by what came later - that was a separate offence (and despite the respective maximum penalties provided and the penalties imposed, a vastly more serious one). 

38One way of testing whether the questioned remarks did deflect his Honour from a properly objective assessment of the gravity of the break enter and steal offence is to ask whether, absent the arson offence, an assessment of mid-range gravity was open to his Honour. 

39The break enter and steal offence involved breaking into a school, and stealing a significant quantity of equipment and property. The manner of the break and entry is not disclosed in the materials. 

40The applicant's argument was that, when separated from the arson offence, the break enter and steal offence could not reasonably be seen as of mid-range gravity. In order to understand the manner in which that argument was presented, it is necessary to understand the legislative provisions that create the offence. Section 112 of the Crimes Act is relevantly in the following terms: 

""(1) A person who: 

(a) breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein ... 

is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 

(2) Aggravated offence 
A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 

(3) ..."" 

41A ""serious indictable offence"" is defined in s 4 of the Crimes Act as meaning: 

"" ... an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more."" 

42Section 105A prescribes ""circumstances of aggravation"". They are the following: 

""(a) the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument; 
(b) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons; 
(c) the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person; 
(d) the alleged offender intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on any person; 
(e) the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty; 
(f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed."" 

43The ""serious indictable offence"" which the applicant committed was larceny. By s 117 of the Crimes Act , the maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 5 years - that is, at the very bottom of the range of sentences that will bring the break and enter offence within s 112. Other serious indictable offences that may be committed in the course of a break and entry that would bring that offence within s 112 include rape, assault, other offences of violence, and property damage. That the ""serious indictable offence"" was larceny, and not one of the more serious indictable offences specified in s 4, is a relevant circumstance in considering the objective gravity of the offence. The nature and value of the property the subject of the larceny is also a relevant consideration: R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 at 27, but not decisive. Here, there was no evidence of the value of the property stolen (as distinct from the value of the property destroyed in the fire). 

44A second matter relevant to the objective gravity of the offence is the circumstance that took the offence into the aggravated category. Here the circumstance of aggravation was that the applicant was in the company of another person. That, in itself, is, in the hierarchy of circumstances prescribed as of aggravation, of a relatively low level or order. In the circumstances of this case, that is more so when it is borne in mind that the person in whose company he was was his 15 year old brother, who had, effectively, simply tagged along. (The applicant's moral culpability in leading his younger brother into criminality, while worthy of condemnation, does not bear upon the objective gravity of the offence: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168). 

45As I have mentioned, in the assessment of objective gravity of this offence, the offence had to be quarantined from the very serious objective gravity of the arson. When that is done, it seems to me that error has been established. It was not open to find the aggravated break enter and steal to have been of mid-range gravity. Two important factors - the nature of the serious indictable offence, and the nature of the circumstance of aggravation - put the offence significantly below that level. In my opinion, the passages from the Remarks on Sentence I have extracted above, together with the assessment reached, establish that his Honour fell into the error of allowing the circumstances of the very serious arson offence to colour his perception of the break enter and steal offence. 

46In my opinion, this ground of appeal has been made good. 

2: Sentencing Procedure Act s 21A(3)(b) 

47It was next complained that his Honour failed to take into account a relevant mitigating factor. Sections 21A(2) and (3) of the Sentencing Procedure Act set out, respectively, aggravating and mitigating factors that a sentencing court is obliged to take into account. Section 21A(3)(b) is: 

""(b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity"" 

Its counterpart in sub-s (2) is sub-s (2)(n): 

""(n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity"" 

48Counsel for the applicant interpreted the passage extracted above at [28] as rejection of a submission that the arson offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 

49I have difficulty in so reading the passage. While I accept that there is some lack of clarity, the paragraph in which it appears opens with a reference to aggravating factors. At the conclusion of that part of the Remarks, the sentencing judge moved to consider mitigating factors, starting with the applicant's plea of guilty. 

50In my opinion, the ground is based upon an erroneous reading of a specific passage in the Remarks on Sentence. It is true that his Honour made no reference to s 21A(3)(b) and no finding concerning any such mitigating factor. Had he done so, in my opinion (contrary to the submissions of the Crown) a finding favourable to the applicant would have been inevitable. 

51Notwithstanding that the observation appears in that part of the Remarks on Sentence that deal with aggravating factors, nor do I read it as a finding that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. It was merely an observation that, while the offence (at least the arson offence) was unpremeditated, it was nevertheless a conscious and deliberate act. This is correct and unobjectionable. 

52In my opinion, it was an error to fail expressly to advert to and accept the submission made on behalf of the applicant concerning an available mitigating factor. However, in all of the circumstances of this case, it was not, in my opinion, an error of any great moment. 



3: Special Circumstances: s 44(1) Sentencing Procedure Act 

53Sections 44(1) and (2) provide as follows: 

""(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 

(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision). "" (italics added) 

54I have set out above what the sentencing judge said about the structure of the sentences. He made no express reference to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. I do, however, read the reference to allowing the applicant an opportunity to rehabilitate into the community as a reference to special circumstances permitting departure from the statutory ratio. That is a very common reason given by sentencing judges for such a departure. It is also in part supported by the sentences imposed. 

55The sentence imposed in respect of the break enter and steal offence was varied from the statutory ratio: the non-parole period imposed is 60 percent (as distinct from 75 percent provided by s 44) of the head sentence. The sentence imposed in respect of the arson offence - 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years - was precisely in accordance with the s 44 proportion. 

56Accumulation produced a different result. The aggregate sentence is of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years: the non-parole period is therefore 66.5 percent of the aggregate head sentence. While that is not an enormous variation, it is not insignificant: the non-parole period, if the s 44 proportions were applied, would have been 4 years and 6 months. The applicant has therefore received a benefit of a reduction in the non-parole period of 6 months. 

57However, the argument went further, and incorporated reference to the total of all sentences to which the applicant was subject, including the sentence imposed in the Children's Court in November 2009 and which the applicant had been serving until shortly before the imposition of these sentences. When that is factored in, the overall non-parole period is 70 percent of the overall head sentence, a reduction of only 5 percent. 

58The first question, therefore, is whether the determination of the proportion ought to have included that earlier sentence. 

59I am not persuaded that it was an error not to have taken the earlier sentence into account. The non-parole period of that sentence had expired three weeks before sentencing. The exercise which his Honour undertook was a discrete one, relevant to the two offences on the indictment. 

60A further argument was put, to the effect that his Honour failed to give reasons for his finding of special circumstances, making it difficult for this Court to appreciate whether, in the result, he achieved his purpose. Reference was made to the decisions of this Court in R v McDonald, (unreported, 12 October 1998) and R v Silver [1999] NSWCCA 108. 

61In my opinion, the reasons given for the finding were inadequate. They do not allow this Court, with confidence, to know why his Honour structured the sentences as he did. I am prepared to infer that it was his Honour's intention to allow the applicant an extended period on parole under supervision in order to give him the best chance of achieving his goal of rehabilitation. The allowance made was small, but not inadequate. I would reject this ground of appeal. 


4: Manifestly Excessive? 

62On behalf of the applicant it was contended that both sentences are manifestly excessive. As the Crown accepts, the outcome of this ground in respect of the aggravated break enter and steal offence depends largely upon the outcome of ground one. As I would uphold ground one, I would also uphold this ground to the extent that it relates to that offence. 

63Counsel for the applicant had a more difficult task in asserting that the sentence imposed in respect of the arson offence was also manifestly excessive. His Honour found that this offence was ""at a high level of objective seriousness""; that, having regard to the damage, can hardly be contested. There is, as I have suggested above, a clear anomaly in the prescribed maximum sentences for the two offences. A first reaction to the sentence imposed for the arson offence would suggest that it was extremely lenient. However, it is 40 percent of the maximum prescribed sentence, in respect of an unpremeditated offence, committed by a 19 year old (who was, it must be recognised, on bail at the time). 

64It was also contended that the applicant's motive in lighting the fire was not as serious as, for example, cases where such an offence is committed for vandalism or revenge, or to obtain insurance or reap damage upon others. The Crown contested this, suggesting that a motive of avoiding punishment for a less serious offence is no less serious than those. I accept the Crown's position on this. The applicant's motive was entirely self-protection, to avoid the consequences of the earlier committed offence. 

65I am unable to conclude that the head sentence was manifestly excessive. Nor do I consider that the non-parole period, of itself and standing alone, was manifestly excessive. 

66Given the view I have reached about ground one and the sentence imposed in respect of the aggravated break and enter offence, it will be necessary to re-sentence. Against that contingency, the Court accepted affidavit evidence showing that the applicant has applied himself whilst in custody and has undertaken educational courses. This is a positive development, and has some, although slight, bearing upon the sentences I propose. There are also concerns about the applicant's health. He is significantly underweight. 

67As I have indicated, I would not interfere in the head sentence imposed in respect of the arson offence. In respect of the aggravated break enter and steal offence, I consider that an appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years. I would reduce the degree of accumulation to 6 months, so that the sentence commences on 21 January 2011. This would produce an aggregate head sentence of 4 years and 6 months, with an overall non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. 

68I am satisfied that the applicant will require significant rehabilitative assistance on his release, and would therefore, in respect of the arson offence, vary the statutory ratio by reducing the non-parole period to 2 years and 6 months. 

69I would not like it to be thought that I am not conscious of the extreme seriousness of the arson offence. This was an offence that, plainly, had an intense effect on a small and impoverished community, and on a band of dedicated teachers. Against that has to be balanced in the determination of a just sentence for a serious crime the youth and disadvantage of the applicant, and the impressive steps he has taken towards rehabilitation. Balancing these two considerations has not been an easy task. Ultimately, I have leaned in favour of rehabilitation. 

70The orders I propose are as follows: 

1. Leave to appeal granted; 

2. Appeal allowed in respect of count 1; 

3. The applicant be re-sentenced as follows: 

1.Count 2: imprisonment for 4 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 21 July 2010 and expiring on 20 January 2013, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months, expiring on 20 July 2014; 
2.Count 1: imprisonment for a term of 4 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 21 January 2011 and expiring on 20 January 2013, with a balance of term of 2 years, expiring on 20 January 2015. 

71The applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 20 January 2013. 

72BUDDIN J: I agree with Simpson J.

		22 August 2011",2011-07-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757471,Jaturawong v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 168,"Judgment 

1BEAZLEY JA : On 14 May 2010, the applicant pleaded guilty to and was sentenced in respect of 7 counts of being an accessory before the fact to the offence of Misconduct in Public Office, committed by Paul Francis McPherson. 

2The principal offender, Mr McPherson, was sentenced at the same time in respect of one offence of corruptly receiving a reward contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s 249B (count 1) and for one offence of Misconduct in Public Office (count 2). 

3Pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 166, Mr McPherson was also dealt with in respect of two further offences contained in a Form 1 attached to count 1, the s 249B offence. Those offences were a further specific offence pursuant to s 249B(1)(a)(i) for corruptly issuing a licence in exchange for a small amount of cannabis and a further charge of false evidence given to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), contrary to the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988, s 80(c). 

4The offences under the Crimes Act , s 249B carried a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. The offence of giving false evidence to ICAC relevantly carried a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment. 

5The offence of Misconduct in Public Office is a common law offence in respect of which the penalty is at large. As the offence to which the applicant was an accessory was a common law offence, the penalty for the accessory offence is also at large. However, when sentencing for a common law offence, the court has regard to any corresponding statutory offence as a reference point for the imposition of any penalty: see R v Hokin, Burton and Peisley (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 280 at 291. 

6In this case, the Crimes Act , Pt 4A provides for offences of corruptly receiving commissions and other corrupt practices in respect of which the maximum sentence is 7 years imprisonment. Mr McPherson's misconduct was in corruptly receiving payments whilst acting as the Manager of the Botany Registry of the RTA. Both the applicant and the Crown accepted that a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment was the relevant reference point in this case and that that was the reference point most likely to have been taken by Berman DCJ. 

7Pursuant to the Crimes Act , Pt 9, s 346, an accessory before the fact is liable to the same punishment as the principal offender. Accordingly, a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment is also the relevant reference point for the offences committed by the applicant and again, it was assumed by the applicant and the Crown that his Honour sentenced the applicant by reference to a maximum penalty of 7 years. 

8His Honour imposed upon the applicant a total aggregate sentence of 2 years 10 months imprisonment to date from 14 May 2010 and to expire on 13 March 2013, with a total aggregate non-parole period of 1 year 8 months to date from 14 May 2010 and to expire on 13 January 2012. His Honour allowed a 20 per cent discount for the applicant's plea of guilty to each count. 

9Mr McPherson was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 3 years comprising an effective non-parole period of 2 years to date from 14 May 2010 to 13 May 2012 with a balance of 12 months to date from 14 May 2012 to 13 May 2013. His Honour allowed a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty. 

10For reasons which I explain below, it is relevant in the case of Mr McPherson to understand the sentences that his Honour imposed for each offence on the indictment. On count 1 on the indictment (that is, the s 249B offence), taking into account the offences on the Form 1, his Honour imposed a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to date from 14 November 2010 (that is, the date of sentence). 

11On count 2 on the indictment (that is, the Misconduct in Public Office offence) his Honour sentenced Mr McPherson to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 14 November 2010 with an additional term of 12 months (giving a head sentence for this offence of 2 years 6 months). 

12Accordingly, Mr McPherson was sentenced to a total aggregate sentence in respect of which the additional term was 2 months longer than that which was imposed on the applicant, and received a non-parole period which was 4 months longer than that to which the applicant was sentenced. 

13Although Mr McPherson received a longer sentence overall, the applicant received a longer aggregate sentence for the accessorial offence than Mr McPherson received for the principal offence of Misconduct in Public Office. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 months as compared to a non-parole period of 18 months in the case of Mr McPherson. The applicant was sentenced to a balance of term of 14 months compared to a balance of term of 12 months in the case of Mr McPherson. 

Background facts to the offending conduct 

14Mr McPherson was the Registry Services Manager of the Botany Motor Registry. The position of Registry Services Manager was the most senior position at the Registry, with duties involving the proper management of the Registry, which included probity obligations, the overview of procedural regularity in the conduct of licensing matters, adherence to the RTA's policies and procedures, and staff supervision, including the checking of licence applications. 

15Mr McPherson had authority to undertake testing of applicants for driver licences and the issue of licences to those who passed their test, although this was not a routine part of his responsibilities. Mr McPherson in fact engaged in those activities from time to time. He also, from time to time, administered and assessed applicants for driver licences who sat the Driver Knowledge Test, issued driver licences, including licence upgrades; allocated examiners to practical driver testing and allocated test routes to be taken by applicants for the practical part of the licence test. 

16The applicant was a driving instructor and advertised his business in a Thai language newspaper. 

17Some time in about 2004, the applicant made the acquaintance of an alleged co-offender, Victor Phomsavanh (Victor), who ran a Thai restaurant in Mascot. Mr McPherson was a regular patron at the restaurant. The applicant, Mr McPherson and Victor became involved in a scheme whereby for payment made to him by Victor, Mr McPherson improperly assisted applicants to obtain learner permits or driver licences. He did so in a variety of ways, including by assisting applicants answering questions on the Driver Knowledge Test, indicating in advance the route an examiner would take them on when undertaking a driving test, or in some cases, falsely creating computer entries indicating that a practical driving test was not required. 

18The common law Misconduct in Public Office offence to which Mr McPherson pleaded guilty occurred over the period 31 October 2004 to 29 August 2006. Mr McPherson was charged with a common law offence, rather than a series of specific offences under s 249B, because he was paid sums of money over this period on a regular basis by Victor, rather than being paid in respect of each individual applicant whom he assisted. In the agreed facts upon which the sentence hearing proceeded, particulars were given of seven persons who were assisted by Mr McPherson, who were clients of the applicant. In addition, particulars were given of another four persons whom Mr McPherson assisted and there was a statement from him that all up he improperly assisted something in the order of 50 people. There was no independent evidence of the amount Mr McPherson received, however, Mr McPherson said he received $3,000 to $4,000 for his involvement in the scheme, as well as the cannabis, which was the subject of the separate s 249B charge. 

19The applicant was charged with individual accessorial offences because he received a specific amount of money from each assisted person. The evidence indicated that the persons whom the applicant assisted and who were the subject of the particular charges paid amounts of money directly to the applicant in the range of $800 to $1,500. His Honour did not make a finding as to the amount that was retained by the applicant, although there was evidence that the applicant paid a portion of this amount to Victor, who in turn paid Mr McPherson. It was not suggested in the agreed facts that the applicant was involved with the other four persons named as having been assisted by Mr McPherson. Nor was the applicant said to have been involved with any other offending. In other words, the charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty were not said to be representative charges. 

20The sentencing judge described the offences committed by both Mr McPherson and the applicant as: 

""... very serious indeed. They involved corruption of a public officer, which strikes at the heart of the administration of good Government ..."" 

21His Honour noted that as a result of the corrupt conduct of both, persons were assisted to obtain licences when they were not otherwise entitled to them and thus constituted a danger to legitimate road users. His Honour reiterated, however, that it was the corrupt nature of the dealings between the applicant and Mr McPherson which was of most concern. 
The personal circumstances of the applicant 

22The applicant was born in Thailand and first visited Australia when he was 27 years of age. He subsequently immigrated to Australia in 1993. He came from a relatively poor family, but his upbringing was otherwise normal. He was relatively well-educated. At the time of the commission of the offences, the applicant had been a driving instructor for about 10 years, having obtained the necessary qualifications for this occupation by undertaking a 6 month TAFE course. In addition to practical training in that course, there was instruction about the importance of avoiding corruption. 

23At the time of the offending, the applicant was married and he and his wife had one young child. The applicant and his wife had separated by the time he came to be sentenced, it would seem because of the applicant's offending conduct. At the time of his sentencing, the applicant was living alone in a boarding house and was undertaking a course of study. He suffers from sleep apnoea and his sleep had been particularly disturbed as a result of the stress of the proceedings. 

24The applicant proffered, by way of explanation for his offending conduct, that he wished to help members of his fellow Thai community. His concern arose because the Driver Knowledge Test, that was a compulsory part of obtaining a licence, was not in the Thai language. His Honour found this explanation unsatisfactory, first, because the applicant received large sums of money for his "" assistance "" to his clients in obtaining their licences and secondly, although the RTA tests are conducted in English, a person undertaking such tests is entitled to have the assistance of an interpreter. His Honour considered therefore, that the essential motivation for the conduct was money. 

25The applicant also sought to excuse his conduct on the basis that bribery was more culturally acceptable in Thailand than in Australia. His Honour was also unimpressed with this excuse. His Honour noted that since the applicant's involvement in the offending conduct had become known, he had become estranged from the Thai community, thus inferring, as I understand his Honour's reasons, that the Thai community did not accept that bribery was acceptable. In any event, his Honour observed that the applicant had learnt in his TAFE course that such conduct was against the law and that he could go to gaol if he engaged in such practices. His Honour further noted that the applicant had told one of his clients to keep quiet about what had happened, because Australians would not accept that type of conduct. His Honour considered that that behaviour exhibited an awareness of the wrongness of his conduct. 

26In his favour, his Honour took into account that the applicant had assisted ICAC with its enquiries into the matter. His Honour considered that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and had expressed appropriate remorse. It was also relevant, in the applicant's favour, that there was a delay in these charges being laid against the applicant following the ICAC hearing. 

27His Honour considered that this was a matter where general deterrence was of significant importance. It was for that reason that his Honour considered a full-time custodial sentence was appropriate. His Honour found special circumstances, in that it was the first time that the applicant would be in custody, but rejected that the applicant had been subjected to extra-curial punishment. 

28His Honour made relevantly similar findings in respect of Mr McPherson, although Mr McPherson's personal circumstances were, obviously, peculiar to him and therefore different from those of the applicant. In particular, his Honour noted that Mr McPherson had lost his job with the RTA, which was a senior position in which he earned $95,000 per year. In addition, he had five children, two from a former marriage and three from his current marriage. The children are young, particularly the three daughters who reside with Mr McPherson and his wife. Mr McPherson's wife has the care of her seriously ill mother. His Honour recognised that there would be a significant impact upon the family's finances, should Mr McPherson go to gaol. However, as his Honour remarked, such consequences are unexceptional: it is the common consequence where a breadwinner in a family commits an offence for which a custodial sentence is appropriate. 

29In addition to finding that Mr McPherson was of a prior good character, his Honour considered that there was much about his personal life about which he was entitled to be proud. Mr McPherson was involved in playing football and in training junior teams, as well as being involved in surf lifesaving. There was substantial evidence of his otherwise good character before the trial judge. His Honour again considered that in the case of Mr McPherson, money was the motivating cause for the offending conduct. 

Issue on the appeal 

30The sole issue on the appeal is whether the sentence imposed upon the applicant's co-offender gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed on him was disproportionate to that imposed on Mr McPherson, having regard to the objective criminality involved in Mr McPherson's offending which gave rise to the Misconduct in Public Office offence and his own offending as an accessory in respect of seven instances of Mr McPherson's misconduct. The Crown understood the issues raised involved a question of parity of sentence. It also appears that his Honour was concerned with that question, as he raised it in the course of the sentencing hearing. In this regard, the Crown submitted that the sentencing process that his Honour was engaged with presented some difficulties, having regard to the fact that Mr McPherson was to be sentenced for an additional offence in respect of which the matters on the Form 1 were to be taken into account. 

31The principles governing parity of sentencing between co-offenders are well established. There will be error in the sentencing process if there is such a discrepancy in the sentences imposed so as to engender in a co-offender a justifiable sense of grievance and an appearance of injustice: see Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 per Mason J at 613; per Dawson J at 623. In determining that question, it is both relevant and necessary to have regard to the gravity of the conduct of each offender, their respective circumstances, including their antecedents and any relevant mitigating circumstances: see Lowe per Brennan J at 617. The significance of this principle in sentencing has been identified as being of "" abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community "": see Regina v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [34]. 

32The test for determining whether a person would have a justifiable sense of grievance is an objective one: see R v Doggett (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 March 1996, unreported); Regina v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 at [6]; Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 308 at [37]. However, even where there is a disparity in the sentences imposed which satisfies this test, an appellate court will not intervene where to do so would result in a sentence being imposed upon the applicant which is itself so disproportionate to a proper sentencing outcome, having regard to the objective and subjective criminality involved in the applicant's offending conduct. In this regard, the court must obey the statutory mandate in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3), namely, that appellate intervention is confined to those cases where the court is of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law: see the Criminal Appeal Act , s 69(3); R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432 at [16]; R v Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114. 

33This statutory injunction underpins the notion of proportionality which requires that a person is to be sentenced with a minimal level of punishment, so that the sentence imposed should bear reasonable proportionality to the objective seriousness of the crime for which the sentence is imposed. As Brennan J said in Lowe : 

""... it is wrong to think that that it is 'more important that sentences should be proportionate to one another than that they should be proportionate to guilt'. R v Robson and East (1970) Crim LR 354, at p 355 ..."" 

See also in this Court: R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242. 

34There are two circumstances where the question whether there has been such disparity in the sentences imposed on co-offenders raises particular difficulties. One is where the offenders are sentenced by different judges: see Lowe at 617 and 622. That was not the case here. The applicant and Mr McPherson were sentenced by the same judge at the same time. There are judicial comments to the effect that where co-offenders are sentenced by the same judge at the same time and detailed reasons given for the sentences imposed, an appellate court will be cautious in intervening on the ground of disparity. Presumably, the reason for these remarks is that in such cases, it is unlikely that the sentencing judge will not be alive to the principles of parity involved in sentencing co-offenders. 

35The other area of difficulty is where the co-offenders are charged with different offences. That is the case here, as it had to be. The offences which each committed were different. That raises the question whether it is the principle of parity which is relevant in this case. 

36The question is not easily resolved and for reasons which I explain in the immediately following paragraph, it is not necessary to finally determine the matter. For my part, I am inclined to consider that the parity principle is relevant, notwithstanding that the applicant and Mr McPherson were guilty of different offences and Mr McPherson's offending was greater in terms of the time over which the offending conduct occurred and the number of instances persons were corruptly assisted to obtain driver licences. Nonetheless, there was a direct correspondence between the accessorial conduct of the applicant and the Misconduct in Public Office conduct of Mr McPherson in respect of the 7 persons who were assisted both by the applicant and Mr McPherson. The Crown also approached the matter on the basis that the parity principle applied. 

37As it turns out, it is not necessary to determine whether the principle of parity in its strict sense does apply because, during the hearing of the appeal, the Crown accepted that the gravity of Mr McPherson's offending conduct was greater than that of the applicant. The Crown also conceded that this was a case where, viewed objectively, the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the sentence imposed on him as compared to the sentence imposed upon Mr McPherson. The Crown's concession in this regard involved its acceptance that Mr McPherson's offending conduct involved not only the seven matters to which the applicant was an accessory, but four other distinct instances of offending, together with other offending conduct, which in total, had involved Mr McPherson corruptly assisting about 50 persons. In this regard, not only was Mr McPherson's offending more extensive, but it occurred over a longer period of time. In making the concession, the Crown also accepted that his Honour had sentenced Mr McPherson for the totality of his conduct to which I have referred. 

38In my opinion, the concession was rightly made. His Honour said: 

""Although Mr McPherson received he says, and there is nothing to contradict it, a relatively small amount of money, three thousand to four thousand dollars plus the cannabis of course, he freely admits that he assisted a large number of people, around fifty in a corrupt way. That really is the gravamen of his misconduct. The money may have been relatively small but there were a very large number of separate criminal corrupt acts committed by the offender."" 

39Mr McPherson was sentenced to 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 18 months for the Misconduct in Public Office offence, involving something in the order of 50 separate occasions of receiving bribes. The applicant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 2 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 20 months for the seven occasions on which he was an accessory to Mr McPherson's Misconduct in Public Office offence. That bald comparison needs to be modified by two considerations. The first is by having regard to the sentence that would have been imposed but for the discount. In Mr McPherson's case, considering the total effective sentence imposed for both counts on the indictment the starting point was 4 years, that is, reduced to 3 years by the 25 per cent discount. In the applicant's case, the starting point was 3 years 6.5 months, reduced to a total effective sentence of 2 years 10 months by the 20 per cent discount. 

40Further, notwithstanding the greater criminality involved in the misconduct offence, Mr McPherson's criminality for which he was sentenced on Count 1, together with his criminality in respect of the offences contained on the Form 1 is not to be overlooked: see In Attorney General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 , especially at [42] where Spigelman CJ observed that in dealing with offences listed on a Form 1, the court is to take into account the matters on the Form 1 "" with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence "". 

41In this case, the applicant was not charged with any other offences other than the seven that were charged on indictment, nor did he admit guilt in respect of any other matters. In particular, he did not provide false information to ICAC, as did Mr McPherson. Nonetheless, he has been given a total effective sentence which is only 2 months less than that of Mr McPherson and a non-parole period which is 4 months less, and, as I have said, he received a more severe total sentence on the accessory offences as compared to the sentence imposed upon Mr McPherson as the principal offender. 

42The Crown initially submitted that Mr McPherson's objective circumstances were far more favourable than the applicant's. That submission may not have been maintained, given the Crown's concession to which I have referred. In any event, I do not consider the submission to have been made good. His Honour did not say so and for myself, I do not see any substantial difference. Both were family men; both have lost their jobs; both had a connection with their respective communities; both have attempted to rehabilitate themselves. The imposition of a gaol term would involve hardship to the families of both, because of the loss of income that both the applicant and Mr McPherson had previously contributed to their respective families. The significant difference in this regard between the two, which, at a subjective level, may well be more serious for the applicant, was that his marriage had come to an end. However, Mr McPherson's family life has remained intact, notwithstanding that his family was undoubtedly experiencing real hardship, engendered by the loss of his substantial earnings as Manager of an RTA Registry and the loss of his support within the home, given the difficult circumstances in which his wife finds herself, looking after the children of the marriage as well as her invalid mother. 

43In my opinion, and as conceded by the Crown, his Honour erred in imposing a disproportionately severe sentence on the applicant as compared to Mr McPherson. That does not of itself mean that the Court should intervene. The Court must be satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law: the Criminal Appeal Act , s 6(3). In my opinion it is. There is nothing in the objective circumstances of the case or in the subjective circumstances of the applicant that warrant him serving a sentence which was more severe than that imposed on Mr McPherson. His accessorial conduct was significantly less, both in the period of time over which and the number of occasions on which the conduct occurred, than the offending conduct of Mr McPherson. 

44Although the sentences imposed upon Mr McPherson were lenient, they were not outside an available discretionary range, particularly having regard to his prior good character. Notwithstanding the lenient sentence imposed on Mr McPherson, appellate intervention in the sentence imposed upon the applicant is warranted in this case. Accordingly, the sentence imposed by Berman DCJ should be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced. 

45In determining the sentence which should be imposed on the applicant, I have applied the same discount for the plea as did the sentencing judge. I have also had regard to the affidavit evidence he has filed which establishes that he has been of good conduct whilst in prison and is taking steps to rehabilitate himself by undertaking courses of study. 

46In my opinion, this is a case where it is appropriate to set an aggregate sentence of imprisonment pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 53A(1). Although the offences were separate and occurred at different times, the offending involved conduct of the same type on each occasion and was part of a course of conduct by the applicant. 

47Accordingly, I propose that the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 months commencing on 14 May 2010 and to expire on 13 September 2011 together with an additional term of 11 months to expire on 13 August 2012. 

48Pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 53A(2), the individual sentences that I would have imposed in respect of the individual offences are as follows: 

Count 1: a fixed term of 10 months to date from 14 May 2010 to 13 March 2011; 

Count 2: a fixed term of 10 months to date from 14 June 2010 to 13 April 2011; 

Count 3: a fixed term of 10 months to date from 14 September 2010 to 13 July 2011; 

Count 4: a fixed term of 9 months to date from 14 November 2010 to 13 August 2011; 

Count 5: a non-parole period of 5 months to date from 14 April 2011 to 13 September 2011 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 13 September 2012; 

Count 6: a non-parole period of 5 months to date from 14 April 2011 to 13 September 2011 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 13 September 2012; 

Count 7: a non-parole period of 5 months to date from 14 April 2011 to 13 September 2011 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 13 September 2012. 

49I propose the following orders: 

1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence; 

2. Appeal allowed; 

3. Sentences imposed by Berman DCJ on 14 May 2011 quashed; 

4. Pursuant to the Crime (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999, s 53A(1) the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 months commencing on 14 May 2010 to expire on 13 September 2011 together with an additional term of 11 months to expire on 13 August 2012.

2757472,Arnold v R [2011] NSWCCA 150,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL : I agree with Davies J. 

2Blanch J : I agree with Davies J. 

3Davies J : The Applicant appeared at Dubbo District Court for sentence on 15 December 2009. He entered pleas of guilty to the following offences: 

Count 1: Recklessly cause grievous bodily harm to Brad Goonrey. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years with a standard non-parole period of 4 years. 

Count 2: Recklessly wound Christopher Fishburn. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 7 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. 

Count 3: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Rachel Davis. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 5 years.

5On count 2 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years 3 months commencing 15 October 2010 with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months expiring 14 February 2012. 

6On count 3 he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months to commence on 15 December 2009 and expiring on 14 September 2010. The total effective sentence was 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months expiring 14 February 2012. 

The facts 

7On the evening of Friday 27 June 2008 the Applicant Ward Arnold and the victims Brad Goonrey, Rachel Davis and Christopher Fishburn were drinking at the Great Western Hotel in Cobar. Earlier in the day and throughout that evening the parties had been drinking at various other licensed premises in Cobar including the Cobar Golf Club, Grand Hotel and the Empire Hotel following a funeral service for a mutual friend. 

8At around 1am on the 28 June 2008 the Applicant was sitting in the front bar area of the Great Western Hotel. The victim Brad Goonrey entered the front bar area and stood about a metre away from the Applicant. Earlier that night Mr Goonrey won a sum of money playing the poker machines in another area of the pub. The Applicant and Mr Goonrey spoke briefly about the money that Mr Goonrey had won. The Applicant suggested that as Mr Goonrey was indebted to him Mr Goonrey should repay some of that debt to the Applicant from his winnings. Mr Goonrey denied that he was indebted to the Applicant. 

9Mr Goonrey decided to leave the bar area and walked in the direction of the male toilets. The Applicant followed him. Before leaving the bar area the Applicant and Mr Goonrey argued briefly. Mr Goonrey continued walking, and as he entered a hallway leading from the bar area to the toilets the Applicant pushed him from behind. That forcible push knocked Mr Goonrey forward into a wall. Mr Goonrey fell face down onto the floor, the Applicant kicked Mr Goonrey between two and four times to his upper body including kicks to his head. 

10Rachel Davis was sitting at a table in the front bar of the hotel. She heard noises and people shouting apparently in the hallway outside the male toilets. From her seat she saw the Applicant standing over the top of Mr Goonrey and kicking him. She went to intervene and assist Mr Goonrey. As she approached the Applicant she said to him, ""Stop it"". The Applicant went to push her away and he struck Miss Davis to the left side of her face with his right hand. 

11Christopher Fishburn is the partner of Miss Davis. As he left the male toilets Mr Fishburn came upon the scene as the Applicant struck Miss Davis. He approached the Applicant and said, ""What's going on? What are you doing hitting fucking Rach?"" The Applicant head butted Mr Fishburn to the face. Police and ambulance were called. By the time the police arrived the Applicant had left the hotel. The police observed that Mr Goonrey was well affected by alcohol and his injuries required treatment. Both Miss Davis and Mr Fishburn were both observed by the police to be moderately affected by alcohol. Both required medical assessment and/or treatment. For those reasons statements were not obtained from the persons at the time. 

12Mr Goonrey was taken by ambulance to Cobar Hospital. He suffered a fractured right clavicle, collar bone, and three dislodged incisor teeth. He subsequently required surgery involving internal fixation of the bone. A bone graft was undertaken at Dubbo Base Hospital on 29 August 2008 consequent upon the fractured right clavicle failing to heal. Mr Goonrey made good post operative progress. In a report dated 20 October 2008 Dr James Plant an orthopaedic registrar at Dubbo Base Hospital noted that a fractured clavicle is not an uncommon injury from a number of the mechanisms of injury and was unable to speculate as to how Mr Goonrey's injury occurred. Mr Goonrey also required dental treatment to extract the three damaged teeth. 

13As a result of being struck by the Applicant Miss Davis suffered some bruising to her left cheek and soreness to her jaw. Mr Fishburn sustained a split top lip which required suturing and miscellaneous shallow lacerations. 

14The Applicant was arrested on Sunday 29 June. He participated in a short record of interview in which the allegations were put to him. However, he declined to make any comment. 

Grounds of appeal 

15The Applicant relies upon 2 grounds of appeal as follows: 
1.The sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the question of special circumstances. 

2. The sentencing judge erred in the conclusion that the first offence was objectively mid-range. 

16It is convenient to deal first with ground 2. 

Ground 2 - Count 1: mid range of seriousness 

17When discussing Count 1 his Honour said this: 

Section 35 of the Crimes Act covers quite a wide variety of factual 
circumstances, however the seriousness of an offence under this section is emphasised by the fact that the legislature has set down a standard non parole period. Although I have already noted how the courts are able to deal with such where there have been pleas of guilty which is the situation here. And s 59 of the Crimes Act is an offence which covers a wide variety of offending situations and is an offence which can be dealt with in the Local Court where a jurisdictional limit of two years imprisonment would apply. 

Whilst recognising that the offences arose out of a continuum of an incident, I must consider each offence separately and then consider the totality. Count one involved deliberately kicking to the body and resulted in serious shoulder injury and loss of teeth. I must find that this places this offence into the mid range of objective seriousness and an appropriate non parole custody should be two years which would be arrived at by considering a term of four years for the offence and allowing for the plea of guilty reducing that to three years and then to a two years non parole term. 

18The Applicant submitted that the offence should not have been regarded as objectively mid-range in circumstances where there were no aggravating factors, and the assault was brief giving rise to injury at the lower end of the wide spectrum which is grievous bodily harm. It was submitted that the offence itself was constituted by a push, and between 2 and 4 kicks to the victim whilst on the ground. 

19The finding of where this lies on the scale of objective seriousness is essentially one of fact. It is necessary to show by reference to one of the considerations in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 that the finding was not open: R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140 at [36]. 

20The Applicant is not able to point to his Honour having taken into account irrelevant considerations or failing to act on relevant considerations, nor that any wrong principle was involved or that the finding was not open on the evidence. The offence consisted not only of the first act in the course of the assault (the push from behind that caused the victim to fall forward into the wall and then onto the floor) but also consisted of the Applicant kicking the victim whist he was on the floor between 2 and 4 times to his upper body and head. His Honour was provided with a photograph of the victim's mouth and face after the assault showing the extent of the damage to his teeth. That photograph formed part of the material before this Court. The extent of the damage to the victim has been described earlier in these reasons. 

21Although his Honour described the offence as being within the mid-range of objective seriousness, the sentence imposed (both the head sentence and the non-parole period), after allowance for a full discount for the plea of guilty, suggests that his Honour saw the offence as being on the low side of the mid-range. 

22I see no error in the way his Honour categorised the offence which was, on any assessment, vicious and cowardly in that the victim was first attacked from behind and then repeatedly assaulted when lying on the ground. 

23I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Ground 1 - special circumstances 

24In relation to count 1 his Honour varied the statutory ratio so that the non-parole period was about two thirds of the head sentence, and in respect of count 2 he varied the statutory ratio so that it was about 59.3% of the head sentence. With the accumulations his Honour provided in relation to the 3 offences the overall statutory ratio was varied so that the non-parole period amounts to 72% of the head sentence. His Honour did not make reference either to special circumstances or to the variation of the statutory ratio. Although the variation on the total sentence is an insignificant variation to the customary ratio, his Honour did not identify any reasons for the variation. 

25Nor can it be discerned from his Honour's remarks that he gave any consideration to the issue of special circumstances notwithstanding the determinations he made concerning non-parole periods and additional terms for each of the counts. Further, although his Honour made reference to a number of the factors identified by the Applicant as justifying the finding of special circumstances, he did so only in the context of looking at aggravating and mitigating factors. 

26All of this was despite his Honour having been asked to find special circumstances based on the fact that it would be the first custodial sentence to be served by the Applicant and that, if his Honour was to accumulate the sentences, that was a further factor to be taken into account in coming to a finding of special circumstances. 

27The Applicant submits that this was a powerful case for the finding of special circumstances and his Honour did not have any regard to the factors and to the issue of special circumstances at all. 

28The Applicant identified the factors as follows: 

had lived in Cobar all his life and for the decade preceding these offences largely lived with his father (T 9/12/09 p 6) whom he described as one of his best friends. (PSR P 1). 

at thirty nine years of age he had an insignificant criminal record constituted by the imposition of various fines. Thirteen years previously he had been dealt with for common assault (x2) and fined $400.00 for each offence. Otherwise the entries were irrelevant. 

the aggression exhibited by the Applicant on this occasion was regarded by one of the victims (Chris Fishburn) as being out of character and a letter in this regard was tendered on the applicant's behalf; 

Mr Fishburn regarded the applicant, with whom he had been familiar for twenty six years as an ""honest, reliable, trustworthy and respectful member of the Cobar community..""; 

he had good employment prospects having been gainfully employed since he left school at the age of fifteen; 

he held various positions but for more than a decade he was employed as a diamond driller contracted to various mining companies; 

the evidence of the applicant's father was that the applicant had been offered an ""overseers job"" which would see the applicant remunerated in the order of $120,000 p.a. The sentencing judge accepted this evidence. 

he did not otherwise have a history of problems with alcohol and his father described never knowing him to take a day off work because of alcohol (T9/12/09 p 8 line 25) 

he had no history of a problem with violence; 

the offence was committed after the wake of a close friend, the point being that issues of loss and grief were not irrelevant to his uncharacteristic loss of control; 

the applicant's father described the relationship between the deceased and the applicant as being very close and his death having a marked impact upon his son; 

similarly the applicant's father described the applicant being very close with the principal victim in the case (Mr Goonery) the relevance of which is that the evidence established that there had been a degree of extra curial punishment that flowed from the family dynamics at play and that the applicant was peculiarly remorseful as a consequence of assaulting his first cousin; 

in combination he had excellent prospects of rehabilitation; 

the officer from Probation and Parole did not identify any criminalizing tendencies but considered the applicant an appropriate candidate for anger management counselling and an associated alcohol and other drug assessment. (PSR p 3). The point in respect of this is that the applicant's path to rehabilitation was well suited to prioritising community based supervision. 

29The Applicant submitted that the failure of the Sentencing Judge to give consideration to the matter of special circumstances was demonstrative of error: R v Henry [2004] NSWCCA 306 at [24]. 

30In Brindley v R (1993) 66 A Crim 204 Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Smart and James JJ agreed) said when discussing the predecessor to s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: 

Next, it is submitted that the judge appears, from the absence of any reference to them in his remarks on sentence, to have failed to consider whether special circumstances existed warranting a different proportion between the minimum and additional terms than that required by s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW). It is a pity that the judge did not expressly refer to this issue in his remarks on sentence. Judges at first instance should by now be aware that the most common submission made in sentencing appeals to this Court relates to s 5(2). As such appeals are inevitably conducted by counsel who did not appear at first instance, that submission is almost always based upon no more than the absence of any reference to the issue in the judge's remarks on sentence. I do suggest that, in order to preclude this Court from drawing incorrect inferences in response to such submissions, sentencing judges should in every case make some reference to s 5(2). 

31In Regina v Novakovic [2004] NSWCCA 437 Sully J (with whom Hidden and Howie JJ agreed) said in relation to ground 4 of the grounds of appeal (that the sentencing judge erred in not finding ""special circumstances""): 

[37] As to Ground 4, the learned sentencing Judge was, to say the least, to the point in dealing with the applicant's submission to his Honour that ""special circumstances"" should be found, and that a shorter than usual non-parole period should be set accordingly. His Honour said simply in his remarks on sentence: ""I do not find special circumstances justifying the variation of the normal relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period"". 

[38] The applicant contends, and I agree, that there were matters, established by credible evidence, and capable of amounting to ""special circumstances"". The applicant's written submissions summarise those matters thus: 
""... (T)he applicant was of prior good character, has never before been to prison, was contrite, is in his 50's and has good prospects of rehabilitation."" 

[39] The applicant complains, and in my opinion justifiably, that his Honour, if intending to make either a specific finding that there were no circumstances capable of amounting in law to special circumstances; or that there were such circumstances available in principle, but that his Honour was not prepared to find them in fact; was obliged to give some explanation, however brief, of why he was not going to make such a finding in fact. 

[40] In my opinion there is some proper scope for some modest reduction in an otherwise appropriate non-parole period by reason of the aforesaid special circumstances. To that extent I would uphold Ground 4. (emphasis in original) 

32Notwithstanding the adjustment of the ratio for the individual offences in any given case, it is appropriate for the Court to look to the ratio when the sentences are accumulated: Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [30]; R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215 at [17]-[22]. 

33Because his Honour varied the statutory ratio in relation to each of counts 1 and 2, (and it may be inferred therefrom that he had special circumstances in mind), when he accumulated the sentences the variation was almost entirely lost. It seems unlikely that his Honour did not have special circumstances in mind because of the variation he made for the individual offences. His failure, however, to make reference to special circumstances was, nevertheless, an error. 

34Not only did his Honour make no reference to the matter of special circumstances, but there were a number of matters to be found in the factors identified in para [28] above, which were capable of amounting to special circumstances. His criminal record was relatively short, with the last offence being a relatively minor drug possession conviction some 8 years earlier. It was his first time in prison, he had been continually employed since leaving school, and other subjective matters referred to by the Sentencing Judge as well as the pre-sentence report suggested he had good prospects of rehabilitation. The Judge appeared to accept that he was remorseful for what had happened. 

35In my opinion, the failure of the Sentencing Judge to refer to special circumstances, or to consider the effect of the matters I have mentioned on the sentence, amount to error. I would uphold ground 1. 

36The remaining issue is whether any other sentence should be imposed. 

37Because there were a number of indications to justify a finding of special circumstances (first time in custody, good prospects of rehabilitation particularly shown by continuous employment with good family support and indeed support from one of the victims) and because his Honour clearly had in mind varying the statutory ratio for counts 1 and 2, it would be appropriate to vary the non-parole period that resulted from the accumulation of the sentences. 

38Although 3 offences were committed they all arose from the same incident. The Applicant and the victims were all well known to each other and had been drinking together so that general deterrence is of less significance than where strangers were assaulted in or near licensed premises. 

39In my opinion, it would be appropriate to vary the non-parole period in respect of Count 1 so that it expires on 14 August 2011 and to vary the commencement date of the sentence in respect of count 2 so that it commences on 15 April 2010 and expires on 14 August 2011. The total effective sentence would therefore be 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months expiring 14 August 2011, and on the sentence for Count 2 I would order his release to parole on 14 August 2011. 

Conclusion 

40I propose the following orders: 

(1) Grant leave to appeal. 

(2) Appeal allowed. 

(3) Quash the sentences imposed by Woods ADCJ in respect of counts 1 and 2. 

(4) In lieu sentence the Defendant as follows: 

(a) On count 1 imprisonment for 3 years commencing 15 October 2009 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months to expire on 14 August 2011; 

(b) On count 2 imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months commencing 15 April 2010 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months expiring on 14 August 2011, and order his release to parole on 14 August 2011.

2757473,Strickland v R O'Connor v R [2011] NSWCCA 166,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P : I agree with Buddin J. 

2SIMPSON J : I agree with Buddin J. 

3BUDDIN J : These applications for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court were heard together. The applicants, who were co-offenders, each pleaded guilty to four offences, all of which were committed on 13 July 2009. The first offence to which each applicant pleaded guilty was an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. The circumstance of aggravation was that it was committed ""in company"". The applicant Strickland also pleaded guilty to three counts of break, enter and steal whilst the applicant O'Connor also pleaded guilty to two of the same counts of break, enter and steal and to a related count of receiving. 

The sentences 

(a) The applicant Strickland 

4In respect of the second break, enter and steal offence (Count 3a), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 18 February 2010 with the total term being 3 years 4 months and 24 days imprisonment. In respect of the first break, enter and steal offence (Count 2a), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 18 August 2010 with the total term being 3 years 4 months and 24 days imprisonment. In respect of the final break, enter and steal offence (Count 4a), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 18 February 2011 with the total term being 4 years and 3 months. Each of those offences attracted a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. In respect of the aggravated break, enter and steal offence (Count 1), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 18 August 2011 with the total term being 5 years 1 month and 6 days. That offence attracted a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. His total effective sentence thus consists of a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months with the total term being 6 years 7 months and 6 days. 

The applicant O'Connor 

5In respect of the count of receiving (Count 2a), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 8 March 2010 with the total term being 2 years 6 months and 18 days. That offence attracted a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. In respect of the first break, enter and steal offence (Count 3a), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 8 June 2010 with the total term being 2 years 11 months and 21 days. In respect of the other break, enter and steal offence (Count 4a), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 8 September 2010 with the total term being 3 years 4 months and 24 days. In respect of the aggravated break, enter and steal offence (Count 1), the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 8 December 2010 with the total term being 5 years 1 month and 6 days. His total effective sentence thus consists of a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months with the total term being 5 years 10 months and 6 days. 

6The sentences in respect of each applicant were structured in such a fashion as to give effect to a finding of ""special circumstances"". 

The proceedings on sentence 

7The facts which give rise to the various offences are not in dispute and can be briefly stated. The two applicants, and an unidentified male, were seen getting out of a motor vehicle and then observed to enter the premises in which the offence giving rise to count 1 was committed. The witness noted the vehicle's registration number and contacted the police. As police were driving to the scene they passed the vehicle in which the applicants were travelling. A short time later, police located the vehicle at a railway station. The applicants were seen nearby and police recognised them as having been in the vehicle which they had seen earlier. The applicant Strickland admitted that the vehicle was owned by his girlfriend. The applicants were arrested but declined an opportunity to be interviewed. Police located a large amount of stolen property in the vehicle. It included several items of jewellery and a money box containing $25 in coins which had been stolen during the offence which gave rise to count 1. Enquiries revealed, in respect of Count 2a, that property to the value of $9290 had been stolen. It consisted of computer and other items of electrical equipment. Most of the property, other than two laptop computers and two portable hard drives, was recovered. In respect of the offence giving rise to Count 3a, the property stolen consisted mainly of electrical equipment and jewellery, much of which was not recovered. In respect of the offence giving rise to Count 4a, once again jewellery as well as computer and other items of electrical equipment were stolen. The computer and electrical equipment were recovered, but none of the victim's jewellery, estimated to be worth $2680, was recovered. 

8In relation to the three offences of break, enter and steal committed by the applicant Strickland, the Crown case was that he was the one who actually broke into the premises in question. In relation to two of those offences (Counts 3a and 4a), the Crown case was that the applicant O'Connor was a principal in the second degree in that he remained outside the premises aiding and abetting the applicant Strickland by acting as a ""lookout"". In relation to the receiving offence, the Crown case was that the applicant O'Connor received the property which the applicant Strickland had stolen from the premises into which he had broken. 

The applicant Strickland 

9The applicant was 24 at the time of committing these offences. He is an Aboriginal man who was raised, in the main, by his mother in the Mount Druitt area. He suffered abuse at the hands of his father and no longer has any contact with him. He developed a drug habit at the age of 11 or 12 and commenced to abuse alcohol when he was 14. His past endeavours to overcome his dependency upon alcohol and illicit drugs had met with mixed success. The applicant has two children with a former partner who remains supportive of him. The evidence revealed that the applicant had been spending time in custody productively. He had completed a Getting Smart program which was designed to overcome his drug and alcohol problems. He was also studying Aboriginal art and culture through TAFE and was a delegate for Aboriginal inmates. Also before the sentencing judge was a report from the Education Manager which indicated that the applicant was working in an industrious fashion in the gaol laundry. There was evidence that the applicant had prospects of obtaining employment upon his release from custody. 

10The applicant has a criminal record which commenced when he was 15. Although he was dealt with as a juvenile for a variety of offences including break, enter and steal and other matters of dishonesty, driving matters, escaping from police custody and possession of drugs, he had not received a custodial sentence. In May 2005 (following an appeal to the District Court) he received an effective sentence of 12 months with a non-parole period of 4 months and 8 days in respect of 3 offences of break, enter and steal and related matters. Apart from some relatively minor matters in 2008, the applicant did not come under notice again until 2009. He then received a series of suspended sentences for a variety of offences, the most significant of which were offences of break, enter and steal and driving whilst disqualified. Those sentences were designed to enable him to continue his participation in the Drug Court program. The present offences were committed whilst the applicant was the subject of those suspended sentences. 

11The applicant has remained in continuous custody since his arrest for these offences on 13 July 2009. On 18 September 2009 he was sentenced at Parramatta Drug Court to a non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 19 February 2009 with the total term being 1 year and 11 months in respect of the matters for which he had previously received suspended sentences. He was also sentenced on 21 June 2010 to an effective fixed term of 9 months to commence on 19 February 2010 in respect of two offences of driving whilst disqualified. His earliest release date is 17 August 2014 by which time he will have been in custody for a period of 5 years 1 month and 4 days. The total effective term of the sentence expires on 23 September 2016, a period of 7 years 2 months and 10 days. 

The applicant O'Connor 

12Although there was material available which suggested that this applicant had just turned 22 at the time of committing the offences, the sentencing judge accepted that he was in fact only 20. He was initially raised in Grafton and Lismore before moving to Sydney following his parents' divorce. He apparently had learning difficulties and was diagnosed with ADHD. He was expelled from a number of schools, including from a special behavioural school. As a result of his learning difficulties and other challenges, he has acquired few educational skills and has had very limited work experience. He has a significant history of dependence upon illicit drugs having first used drugs at the age of 14. For a number of years the applicant had a troubled relationship with his mother. Indeed, at one stage he left the family home at her request and went to live in a youth refuge. For some time thereafter he maintained an itinerant lifestyle. On a positive note, he now enjoys the support of his mother. He also has a son who was born in 2005 with whom he has remained in regular contact. 

13This applicant also has a not insignificant criminal record. He appeared both in the Children's Court and in the Local Court on several occasions between 2003 and 2007 in respect of driving offences, contravening apprehended domestic violence orders and common assault. He was either fined or placed upon a bond in relation to those matters. In December 2007 he was given suspended sentences in respect of two offences of aggravated break, enter and steal and for breaching earlier bonds. In 2008 he received two further suspended sentences for offences of wilful damage and larceny respectively. Each of the suspended sentences was designed to enable him to continue on the Drug Court program. The present offences were committed whilst the applicant was the subject of those suspended sentences. 

14This applicant has also been in continuous custody since his arrest on 13 July 2009. On 16 October 2009 he was sentenced at the Parramatta Drug Court to a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 9 September 2008 with a total term of 3 years 6 months imprisonment in respect of the matters for which he had previously received suspended sentences. His earliest release date is 7 December 2013 by which time he will have been in custody for just under 4 years. The total effective term of the sentence expires on 13 January 2016, a period of exactly 6 years. 

15The sentencing judge determined that count 1 fell ""below the mid-range of objective seriousness"". Her Honour found that although it involved a degree of planning, it could not be characterised as a sophisticated offence. In relation to each of the other offences, her Honour concluded that they ""also [fell] below the mid-range constructed for like offences"". Her Honour noted that significant quantities of property had been taken, not all of which had been recovered. Some of the items taken clearly had sentimental value. As is apparent, the applicants received identical sentences in relation to Count 1. In respect of the other three counts, her Honour imposed sentences which reflected the different criminality which the applicants had displayed. No complaint is made on behalf of the applicant Strickland about the fact that a different sentencing outcome was arrived at in respect of the applicant O'Connor. Her Honour observed that each applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences and that each had criminal records which contained entries for offences of the same kind. Her Honour allowed each applicant a 15% discount on account of their pleas of guilty. Her Honour also found, having heard each of them give sworn evidence, that they were genuinely remorseful for their actions. Her Honour nonetheless concluded that there was a high likelihood that each of them would reoffend because ""their records disclose entrenched antisocial and criminal behaviour"". 

The grounds of appeal 

16The applicant Strickland relied upon the following grounds: 

Ground 1: 
Her Honour failed to take into account that three of the four charges could have been dealt with in the Local Court and failed to have regard to the maximum penalty with respect to those counts. 

Ground 2: 
The sentencing judge erred in failing to properly apply the principle of totality in respect of the matters for which the applicant came for sentence before her Honour and the matters for which the applicant was already serving a sentence. 

Ground 3: 
The sentences imposed are manifestly excessive. 

17The applicant O'Connor relied upon the following grounds: 

Ground 1 
The sentencing judge failed to consider and apply the doctrine of totality when 

(a) accumulating the sentences, 

(b) ordering the sentences to commence on 8 March 2010, the date of the expiration of the non-parole period of an unrelated sentence. 

Ground 2 
The total sentence is manifestly excessive. 

18At the hearing this applicant was granted leave to add a ground which was in the same terms as the first ground relied upon by the applicant Strickland. 

19As can be observed the grounds of appeal are, for all practical purposes, identical. 

Manifest excess 

20It is convenient to deal first with the ground relied upon by each applicant that the sentences are manifestly excessive. 

21In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in a joint judgment, said: 

A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. (at para 45) 

22Each applicant placed particular emphasis upon the sentence which was imposed in respect of Count 4a. In respect of the applicant Strickland that sentence, it is to be recalled, consisted of a non-parole period of 3 years with the total term being 4 years and 3 months imprisonment. It was submitted that that sentence may be contrasted with those imposed in respect of each of counts 2a and 3a which consisted of a non-parole period of 2 years with the total term being 3 years 4 months and 24 days imprisonment. In essence, it was submitted that the sentence in respect of Count 4a was significantly longer than those imposed in respect of Counts 2a and 3a notwithstanding the fact that no basis existed upon which that offence could properly be differentiated from the other two. Moreover, it may be observed that the non-parole period selected for Count 4a was precisely the same as that selected in respect of Count 1, which was not only a more serious offence but one in respect of which a standard non-parole period applied. 

23A similar submission was made on behalf of the applicant O'Connor. In respect of Count 4a, this applicant received a non-parole period of 2 years with a total term of 3 years 4 months and 24 days imprisonment whilst in relation to Count 3a he received a non-parole period of 2 years but with a total term of 2 years 11 months 21 days imprisonment for an offence which was relevantly indistinguishable from it. 

24It is common ground that the sentencing judge made no endeavour to explain what, on its face, appears to have been an anomalous sentencing outcome. In the circumstances I accept that her Honour fell into error in failing to comply with the principles enunciated in Pearce (supra) in that her Honour did not ""fix an appropriate sentence"" for the offence which, in respect of each applicant, gave rise to Count 4a. 

The failure to take into account the fact that three of the offences could have been dealt with in the Local Court 

25It is common ground that the offences which gave rise to counts 2a, 3a and 4a in respect of each applicant were all Table 1 matters, within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , and as such were capable of being dealt with in the Local Court. The maximum penalty which the Local Court can impose for such an offence is 2 years imprisonment. It was in that context that counsel for each of the applicants relied upon this Court's decision in Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177. After reviewing the relevant authorities, Davies J with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said: 

Whilst it is clear that there is no obligation on the sentencing Judge to regard himself or herself limited by the maximum penalty available in the Local Court, two relevantly important principles emerge from the cases. The first is that the extent of the criminality is an important consideration in having regard to the Local Court penalty: R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at [21]; Regina v Said El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29] and McCullough at [26]. Secondly, where it appears that the matter of the Local Court penalty has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge that may properly justify the grant of leave to appeal: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16]. 

In the present case, it is likely that the matter was entirely overlooked by the sentencing Judge because it is accepted that neither counsel drew it to the Judge's attention. Further support for that inference derives from the omission of the sentencing Judge to make any reference to the fact that the offences could have been dealt with by the Local Court and from the length of the sentence imposed for each of the offences . 

This failure to refer to the Local Court limitation on sentence amounts to an error justifying the intervention of this Court. This is because, as the highlighted passages in Palmer make clear, the fact that the Local Court could have dealt with the matter is a relevant consideration to be taken into account. (at paras 43-45) (emphasis added) 

26It is also common ground that, as in Bonwick , the sentencing judge in the present case made no reference to the fact that the offences in question could have been dealt with in the Local Court. It is equally clear that neither party drew the matter to her Honour's attention. It was urged on behalf of the applicants that her Honour's conclusion that each of the offences in question were ""below mid-range"" was of particular significance in an assessment of this ground. It was submitted that the total sentence of 4 years and 3 months imprisonment imposed upon the applicant Strickland in relation to Court 4a was impossible to reconcile with her Honour's finding, particularly as he had pleaded guilty and was remorseful. Moreover, it further demonstrated, so it was submitted, that her Honour had simply overlooked the fact that that matter, as well as the other two offences, could have been dealt with in the Local Court. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant O'Connor that there was even greater warrant for consideration to have been given to this issue in his case, since his role was limited to that of a principal in the second degree in respect of the two break, enter and steal offences, whilst in respect of the remaining matter he was to be sentenced in relation to the less serious offence of receiving. 

27In those circumstances I accept that this ground has also been established. In my view the combination of errors which I have identified caused the sentencing process to miscarry with the consequence that the Court should intervene and proceed to re-sentence each of the applicants. 

28In re-sentencing the applicants I would adopt the sentencing judge's findings, to which there was no challenge, both concerning the relative objective seriousness of the various offences and the matters that served to mitigate the otherwise appropriate penalties. I have also had regard to the two affidavits which were filed on behalf of the applicant Strickland. They reveal that he has continued to pursue such educational opportunities as are available to him and that he has experienced various challenges to his overall health. I would pay appropriate regard to the fact that the offences which gave rise to Counts 2a, 3a and 4a in respect of each applicant could have been dealt with in the Local Court. I recognise that it is then necessary to consider the manner in which the individual sentences are structured so as to give effect to the principles established in Pearce (supra). That will require consideration to be given to the principle of totality. In that respect, I have proceeded upon the basis that it is necessary to have regard to the total period which the applicants must spend in custody, which includes the sentences which were imposed by the Drug Court. I would confirm the finding of ""special circumstances"". In my view it is appropriate to impose fixed terms in respect of Counts 2a, 3a and 4a given the manner in which the sentence in respect of Count 1 will be structured. For that reason I would decline to fix non-parole periods in respect of those counts. 

29I propose the following orders. 

Applicant Strickland 

1 Grant leave to appeal. 

2 Allow the appeal. 

3 Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and in substitution therefore impose the following sentences: 

(i) In respect of Count 2a, sentence the applicant to a term of 18 months to commence on 18 February 2010; 

(ii) In respect of Count 3a, sentence the applicant to a term of 18 months to commence on 18 July 2010; 

(iii) In respect of Count 4a, sentence the applicant to a term of 18 months to commence on 18 December 2010; 

(iv) In respect of Count 1, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 18 May 2011 and to expire on 17 August 2013 with a total term of 4 years and 3 months to expire on 17 August 2015. 

The applicant will be eligible for parole on 17 August 2013. 

Applicant O'Connor 

1 Grant leave to appeal. 

2 Allow the appeal. 

3 Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and in substitution therefore impose the following sentences: 

(i) In respect of Count 2a, sentence the applicant to a term of 12 months to commence on 8 March 2010; 

(ii) In respect of Count 3a, sentence the applicant to a term of 15 months to commence on 8 June 2010; 

(iii) In respect of Count 4a, sentence the applicant to a term of 15 months to commence on 8 September 2010; 

(iv) In respect of Count 1, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 8 December 2010 and to expire on 7 March 2013 with a total term of 4 years and 3 months to expire on 7 March 2015. 

The applicant will be eligible for parole on 7 March 2013.

		29 July 2011",2011-07-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757475,R v Nono [2011] NSWDC 141,"Judgment 

1The offender pleaded not guilty to one count pursuant to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in that on 4 October 2009 at Quakers Hill, New South Wales, being armed with an offensive weapon, a knife, he robbed Hajid Singh Chemma of a sum of cash, the property of Mr Singh and his employer Domino's Pizza for which the maximum penalty is twenty years and to which there is no standard non-parole period. 

2The offender was arraigned on 10 June 2010. On 18 March 2011 after a nine-day trial a jury convicted the offender. 

3The relevant facts may briefly be stated. Some time after 11.00pm on 3 October the offender and a minor were attending a party at premises in Lovegrove Drive, Quakers Hill. A telephone call was made for delivery of nine pizzas at a cost $103.55 to 110 Lovegrove Drive which was the house across the road from the party. At about midnight the pizza delivery driver arrived in Lovegrove Drive. Two men, one black and one white, approached. After the pizzas were handed over, the offender told the pizza delivery driver, ""Give me your money"" and held up a large knife he had brought with him. The driver handed over the blue pencil case containing about $460 and the men took the pizzas and a bottle of Coca Cola. The offender told the driver to leave, threatening that he knew where the driver worked and warning that what would happen if he contacted police. 

4Police were notified immediately about the robbery. A police car sent to the vicinity sent a radio message at 12.35am that two men fitting the description had been seen in the canal behind Lovegrove Drive. Shortly after that, the offender and his companion were stopped and searched. The victim's blue pencil case was found when the offender was searched. The offender was arrested and conveyed to the police station, as was his companion. Police also attended the Lovegrove Drive premises where the offender and his companion had been attending the party and found and photographed a number of items including a large knife and a small sum of money. 

5The offender who is now aged twenty-one years has a short criminal history which is set out in exhibit A and includes offences of a minor nature. 

6I now turn to consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender, all of which have been taken into account and which are contained in a pre-sentence report dated 29 July 2011 and a report from Duffy Robilliard, psychologist dated 18 July 2011. 

7The offender was born on 18 March 1990 and he is now twenty-one years of age. The offender is the second eldest of seven children and was born in the Sudan. Up until he was about four he and his family lived in the Sudan in conditions of the utmost hardship. The Probation and Parole Service presentence report perceptively notes that he would have witnessed events totally unknown to the Australian way of life. The offender regularly witnessed violence and atrocities and was deprived of food and shelter, in particular during a period of two weeks when he had to walk with his family to Kenya to a refuge where he remained for another five years before he and his family were able to emigrate to New Zealand. 

8The offender initially showed promise, particularly in relation to sport, but began drinking at the age of twelve and taking drugs, first marijuana and then amphetamines, at the age of fifteen. The offender has told the Probation and Parole officer that the abuse of drugs and alcohol resulted in his criminal behaviour. He has undergone detoxification since his entry into custody on April 2010. 

9The offender comes from a loving and supporting family and I note that his father and three of his siblings are in court. The Probation and Parole report notes that the family has offered to assist in any way possible as they have noticed a positive change in his attitude since being incarcerated. There are indications in the Probation Service report of a change in his attitude and having regard to those changes, his family support and his detoxification, his prospects of rehabilitation are good, particularly if, with the appropriate assistance and supervision on release, he is able to maintain the motivation to overcome his drug and alcohol problems. I note that he has been unable to put his name down for programs in gaol because he has been on remand. 

10The present offence is objectively serious. For offences of this type general deterrence and punishment are most important. Given the offender's prior criminal history, personal deterrence is also of importance, particularly having regard to statements he made to the Probation and Parole officer concerning the offence as set out in that report in relation to a denial of the police facts. 

11Having regard to the objective seriousness of the present offence there is no option but to impose on the offender a full time custodial sentence. I note that no aggravating factors have been drawn to my attention. There was no violence, although there was a serious threat of future violence and a knife was used in the commission of the offence. This is an offence which having regard to the factors that have been drawn to my attention in the course of addresses is one which would fall towards the bottom of the range in terms of seriousness. 

12Although the offender is not to be penalised for not pleading guilty he is not thereby entitled to any discount on sentence that would flow from such plea. 

13In regard to whether a finding of special circumstances should be made, as indicated, I have found that there are special circumstances warranting the adjustment of the non-parole period, having regard to the benefits that will flow to the offender from an extended period of supervision and, having particular regard to the contents of their Probation and Parole pre-sentence report recommendations concerning his drug and alcohol problems and his need for treatment of these and also by reason of his youth. 

14I formally note there is no issue raised in relation to parity concerning the co-offender's sentence. 

15In determining the sentence I have had regard to and taken into account the guidelines enunciated in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 and also in relation to the factors set out in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [162]. In addition to the matters to which specific reference has been made I have also taken into account in respect of the offence all of the matters referred to in s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 

16The offender has spent two periods in custody solely referable to this offence. These are for the periods 4 October 2009 to 12 December 2009, a period of two months and eight days and from 13 April 2010 to date, a period of one year three months and seventeen days, making a total of one year five months and twenty-five days. In accordance with these dates and the discussions I have had with counsel about the appropriate deduction the effective total sentence to be imposed will commence on 4 February 2010 to take into account both those periods in full. 

17The offender is convicted of the offence. The offender is sentenced to five years imprisonment. A non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on 4 February 2010 is set. The nonparole period of two years and three months will expire on 3 May 2012 when the offender is released to parole on supervision, such supervision to continue until 3 February 2015.

		26 September 2011",2011-07-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757479,R v Michael Peter Christiansen [2011] NSWSC 840,"SENTENCE  1On 8 November 2010, the offender, Michael Peter Christiansen, pleaded guilty to four offences, namely that he did murder Paul Elliott on 6 December 2008, that he did possess a shortened firearm without being authorised to do so on 16 December 2008, that he did supply 2985.5 gms of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) on 16 December 2008 and that he did supply 327.58 gms of a prohibited drug (cocaine) on 16 December 2008.  The offender was convicted of each of those offences on that date.  2There are a further 21 offences on a Form One that the offender wishes to have taken into account when sentenced in respect of the murder charge.  Those offences consist of 9 firearms offences, 9 possession of prescribed restricted substances offences, one offence of destroying property by fire, one offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime and one offence of drive whilst disqualified.  3The offence of murder and the offence of supply methylamphetamine each carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  The firearms offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  The supply cocaine offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  4It should be noted that, when the offender pleaded guilty and was convicted, count 3 in the indictment was expressed in terms that the offender supplied not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, and that the stated Law Part Code (3183) corresponded to that offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, for which a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment applied.  5However, the quantity averred in count 3 clearly exceeded the prescribed large commercial quantity of the relevant drug.  The Law Part Code corresponding to that offence is 63588.  When this discrepancy was brought to the Crown's attention, the Court was informed that the offender always understood that he was to be sentenced for supply of a large commercial quantity and that there was no impediment to the amendment of the indictment to reflect the correct Law Part Code.  The Court Attendance Notice for the offence that became count 3 referred to supply of a prohibited drug ""being an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity"", although it too stated the incorrect Law Part Code (3183).  6The form of count 3 is technically correct, although it does not specifically aver ""not less than the large commercial quantity"".  Whilst that particular should have been part of the charge, it is a matter of form, not substance.  Similarly, the allocation of an incorrect Law Part Code on an indictment does not determine the basis upon which an offender is to be sentenced.  The prevailing consideration is whether a circumstance of aggravation converts a lesser offence into a greater offence, or simply increases the maximum available penalty without altering the nature of the charge.  In the latter case, of which count 3 is an example, a failure to comply with the rule of practice that the circumstance ought be charged does not give rise to a miscarriage of justice, unless the offender pleads guilty in the belief that the lower maximum penalty applies : see Warby v R [2007] NSWCCA 173 at [14] - [20].  7Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 allows for the amendment of an indictment with the consent of the offender or with the leave of the Court, on the application of the prosecution.  Section 21 grants a power to the Court to order the amendment of an indictment if it is defective and the amendment does not cause an injustice.  The Crown now makes an application under s 20 to amend the Law Part Code with respect to count 3.  The offender does not oppose the application.  In my view, the amendment is warranted, either under s 20 or s 21.  8Accordingly, I granted the Crown leave under s 20 to amend count 3 of the indictment to the extent that the Law Part Code should read ""63588"".  Following that amendment, the offender adhered to his plea of guilty to count 3.  9The agreed facts upon which the offender stands to be sentenced establish that the offender was contracted by a man named Tran to go to a house to provide protection for Tran, when he met with the deceased for the purpose of attempting a resolution of a dispute between Tran and the deceased over Tran's supply to the deceased of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.  The agreement between the offender and Tran involved taking a large steel box to the house with the intention, if the dispute was not resolved, of possibly having to remove the body of the deceased from the house.  The offender went to the house knowing that there was a very real prospect that the deceased might be killed by him.  Before going to the house, Tran gave the offender the large quantity of methylamphetamine which had earlier been returned by the deceased.  The offender was tasked with the safe storage of the drug in anticipation that Tran might be able to persuade the deceased to take the drug back, in settlement of the dispute, together with a sum of money.  Tran agreed to reward the offender for his services by an introduction to his uncle who imported cocaine and later, told the offender that he would be given some of the proceeds of sale of the methylamphetamine.  The detail of the offender's activities are as follows.  10On Thursday 4 December 2008, the offender met Tran, to whom he was introduced by Jeremy Postlewaight.  The offender had been informed that Tran was arranging to meet with a person from Melbourne (the deceased) about a drug debt.  11At about 2:30 p.m. that afternoon, the offender removed a handgun from a store room at Kennard Storage Unit in Camperdown.  The storage unit was being used by the offender to store drugs and firearms.  He had leased the unit under the false name of Michael Euros.  12At 5:40 p.m. that day the offender placed a yellow duty-free shopping bag containing 2985 g of methylamphetamine into the storage unit.  13On Friday 5 December 2008 the offender purchased a large metal tool box with wheels and hydraulic struts for $880 from a sheet metal business in St Peters.  The same evening, an associate of Postlewaight made enquiries about borrowing a boat for New Year's Eve.  14The deceased, Paul Elliott, was seen in the company of Tran on Friday 5 December 2008 in suburban Melbourne.  Elliot later told his partner that he had picked this person up from the airport and was to take him back to the airport.  The deceased further said ""I have just got news I have to go to Sydney, to a meeting.  If this doesn't go right, you might not see me again "".  The deceased indicated to his partner that he was chasing up an outstanding debt, which was owed to him by Tran, who had earlier sold him a large quantity of methylamphetamine of low grade purity.  15In the evening of Friday 5 December 2008, the deceased hired a black Holden statesman from Budget at Tullamarine Airport.  It was due to be returned at 9:30 p.m. on 8 December 2008.  The deceased regularly hired cars from this company.  16Early on 6 December 2008, the deceased drove his black utility to a factory unit at Airport West.  The deceased's partner followed in the hire car.  During preparations for their departure to Sydney, the deceased moved a package, wrapped in a towel, from the tray of his black utility into the Holden statesman.  The deceased's partner had seen the deceased in possession of a gun in about March or April 2008 and knew that he kept it wrapped in a black sock in the driver's side door of his car.  17The deceased had previously been convicted and served a sentence for aggravated burglary, relating to the theft of methylamphetamine from a pharmacology factory laboratory, estimated to be worth $161 million.  The deceased committed this offence in the company of others, whilst armed with semiautomatic weapons and carrying four extra magazines.  The offender had been informed that the deceased was known to always carry a gun and was a known ""stand over man"" from Melbourne.  18At 11:30 a.m. on 6 December 2008, the offender went to the house of Marcello Urriola and said that he had a big job to do.  He asked Urriola to look after some phones until he got back.  19Meanwhile, the deceased and his partner travelled to Sydney in the hired Holden statesman, arriving in the afternoon of Saturday 6 December 2008.  On arrival, the deceased checked into the Mercure Hotel at Wolli Creek.  Shortly thereafter the deceased told his partner he had to meet someone and that he would be back within the hour.  When he left, the deceased was carrying a black shoulder bag.  The deceased left the hotel at 4:10 p.m.  20In the afternoon of 6 December 2008 the offender drove his van, with Tran as a passenger, to General Holmes Drive in Brighton Le Sands.  A house on that street had been leased by Tran and another man approximately 1 month earlier for the purpose of carrying on a hydroponic cannabis cultivation.  21Tran told the offender that he hoped to persuade the person from Melbourne to settle their dispute by taking back the balance of the methyl amphetamine which the deceased had returned to Tran, after having cut and sold some, in addition to Tran paying the deceased a sum of money.  22Tran and the offender waited for the deceased.  The offender went inside and to the back of the house and Tran waited outside.  Sometime later, the deceased arrived and Tran and he had a discussion which continued inside the house and became acrimonious.  The deceased began to loudly question whether there was someone else in the house and started moving further into the house.  23The offender had his firearm drawn as the deceased was searching the house.  The deceased ultimately came into the room and confronted the offender.  The deceased drew a gun but before he could fire the offender shot him in the chest.  The offender then moved forward and fired a second bullet into the deceased's head.  In all, three shots were fired by the offender.  No shots were fired by the deceased.  24Whilst the offender states that he feared for his own safety at the time that he fired the first shot, his plea to the offence of murder accepts that he was not acting in self-defence when he fired a second time.  25The offender then placed the deceased's body inside plastic garbage bags to stop him bleeding onto the floor.  These bags were already in the house, together with a bucket and other cleaning materials.  Tran wheeled the tool box into the house and the offender and Tran placed the deceased into the toolbox.  They then placed the toolbox into the rear of the offender's van.  The offender was also in possession of a pair of plastic gloves.  26At some time in the course of the following day, the underlay and carpet was cut from the floor of the room where the deceased had been killed.  The offender played no part in this activity.  27The offender drove his van from the house.  Tran took the deceased's vehicle.  The offender returned to his residence in Annandale Street, Annandale and left the metal tool box in the rear of his van.  Jeremy Postlewaight, who was at the offender's home, was informed of the murder and arrangements were made for Postlewaight to return the next day with his boat in order to dispose of the deceased's body at sea.  28After 8 p.m. on 6 December 2008 the offender rang Urriola and asked him to bring the phones back.  Urriola met with the offender at the latter's home that evening.  The offender told Urriola that he ""had done a job with the Asian guy"".  The offender told him that there was a body in a heavy toolbox in the back of his van.  Urriola asked the offender how much he was paid to do the job and the offender replied that he was paid with 12 pounds of ""base"" or methylamphetamine.  29On Sunday 7 December 2008, Urriola returned to the offender's residence.  They both went to Kennards at Camperdown, where the offender returned the handgun, a Smith & Wesson self loading pistol that was used to murder the deceased, to the storage unit.  They then returned to the offender's home.  Shortly afterwards, Jeremy Postlewaight arrived driving a tipper truck towing a large boat.  30The offender and Urriola removed the large toolbox from the rear of the offender's van and lifted it into the boat, with assistance from Postlewaight.  While moving the toolbox from the van to the boat, some blood spilt from the toolbox on the roadway and onto the side of the boat.  The blood on the roadway was cleaned by the offender and the blood on the boat was cleaned by Postlewaight.  31The offender and Postlewaight travelled to Drummoyne towing the boat.  Urriola followed in the offender's van.  Postlewaight launched the boat at Drummoyne and all three men travelled past the heads of Sydney Harbour until they arrived at a spot where the sea reached a depth of approximately 130 m.  The offender used a cordless drill to drill two holes in the toolbox.  Postlewaight tied an anchor to the toolbox.  All three men lifted the toolbox containing the deceased's body and pushed it into the water.  The toolbox sank within seconds.  The deceased's gun was also thrown into the water.  All three men returned to the boat ramp and made their way back to the offender's premises.  32The offender moved the deceased's hire vehicle to a street in Alexandria. At about 9:30 p.m. on 7 December 2008, Urriola and the offender returned to Alexandria where they set fire to the hire vehicle, using petrol that the offender had purchased earlier that morning.  33Following the burning of the car, the offender and Urriola drove to Perth.  On 13 December 2008 the offender returned to Sydney on a Qantas flight under the alias Michael Euros.  34In the morning of Sunday 14 December 2008, the offender went to the storage room at Kennards and placed the deceased's shoulder bag containing his wallet and identification into the store room.  Two days later, the offender again attended the storage unit and moved Elliott's bag onto the top right-hand corner of a cardboard box.  He was arrested in possession of the keys to the storage unit, which had been rented by him from June 2008 in the false name of Michael Euros.  35At the time of his arrest, the offender was in possession of the 2985 g of methylamphetamine that had been placed in the storage unit on 4 December 2008.  This quantity of methylamphetamine is the subject of count 3 in the indictment.  36A subsequent search of the storage unit revealed a bag that belonged to the deceased.  Numerous items of identification belonging to the deceased were found within the bag.  37Drugs found within the storage unit were later analysed and found to be cocaine.  A double barrel sawn off shot gun, a single barrel Winchester pump action shotgun, a number of boxes of ammunition, a Smith & Wesson self loading pistol, a quantity of vials and tablets of anabolic steroids and $24,900 in cash were also found inside various containers within the storage unit.  The firearms, ammunition, steroids and cash are the subject of the offences on the Form One.  38A search of the offender's van also located a quantity of cocaine which, when combined with the cocaine found in the storage unit, makes up the quantity of that prohibited drug in count 4 of the indictment.  39On Wednesday 17 December 2008, police established that Paul Elliott was missing.  The offender was interviewed in relation to this matter on 21 January 2009 and made detailed admissions.  In particular, the offender told police that he had shot and killed Paul Elliott and participated in the disposal of his body.  He told police where the shooting occurred and informed police of the names of those persons who were involved in the deceased's death and/or the disposal of his body.  The offender made a statement on 26 February 2009 which confirmed the detail of the admissions made in the record of interview.  40Notwithstanding these admissions, the offender was committed for trial on the offence of murder on 20 April 2010.  A trial was fixed for 1 November 2010.  However, on that day, the offender indicated an intention to plead guilty, subject to settlement of the agreed facts.  The offender's plea to murder therefore came very late in the criminal trial process and has limited utilitarian value.  Taking these factors into account, I would allow a discount of 10% for the plea of guilty to murder.  41The pleas with respect to counts 2, 3 and 4 on the indictment stand in a somewhat different position.  The offender entered pleas to those counts and to two Form One offences on 20 April 2010.  The Crown concedes that these pleas were entered at the earliest opportunity and that the offender is entitled to a discount of 25% on account of the utilitarian value of those pleas.  42An assessment of the objective gravity of the offence of murder begins with the recognition that the offence involves the felonious taking of a human life, no matter what the reputation or criminal antecedents of the victim.  This principle is also practically demonstrated by the contents of two victim impact statements to which the Court has had regard for the purposes of recognizing the trauma inflicted on the deceased's immediate family.  43The Crown does not press for a life sentence, recognizing, in my view appropriately, that the offence does not fall within the worst category.  The Crown's submission is that the murder falls well above the mid range of objective seriousness, at the higher range of seriousness, for the following reasons :-  (a)The offender effectively contracted with Tran to attend a meeting between Tran and the deceased, knowing there was a high likelihood that he might be required to shoot and kill the deceased.  (b)The offender went to this meeting armed with a loaded pistol.  (c)The offender undertook preparatory steps, indicating that he was prepared to kill the deceased, including the purchase of the toolbox.  (d)The offender secreted himself in a back room of the house.  (e)The offender had his loaded firearm drawn and at the ready as the deceased walked through the door into the room where the offender waited, thereby giving the deceased no opportunity to negotiate, flee or protect himself.  (f)Having shot the deceased with the intention of killing him, the offender callously and methodically disposed of the body, burnt out the deceased's motor vehicle and fled to Perth.  (g)The offender received payment for murdering the deceased by way of a large quantity of methylamphetamine and was offered an opportunity to be introduced to Tran's uncle who imported cocaine.  44In summary, the Crown submits that the offence was in essence a contract killing.  It is submitted that there is little to distinguish a person who is contracted as a ""hitman"" and a person who is hired to provide protection to a drug dealer, contemplating that in all likelihood they will be required to shoot and kill on behalf of the person who has engaged their services.  The Crown relies upon the fact that the sole reason for the offender's involvement was to kill the deceased if called upon to do so.  45The offender takes issue with the submission that the offender knew that there was a ""high likelihood"" that he might be required to kill the deceased.  In effect, the offender seeks to draw a distinction between ""high likelihood"" and ""a very real prospect"".  For my part, the use of the latter terminology in the agreed facts is consistent with the former terminology.  46The offender submits that the Court should reject the submission that the murder was ""in essence a contract killing"".  The offender maintains that the agreed facts accept that the disposal of Mr Elliott was not the relevant contract.  In that regard the offender relies upon paragraph 8 of the agreed facts which reads :-  Tran had agreed to reward the offender for his services by an introduction to his uncle who imported cocaine concealed in rice.  In the event, afterwards Tran told the offender that he would give him some, or some of the proceeds of the sale of the methyl amphetamine referred to ... above.  This would allow the offender to have a regular supply of cocaine.  47I accept that the essence of the agreement between the offender and Tran was the provision of the offender's services as ""muscle"", in the event that Tran could not resolve his dispute with the deceased.  However, even allowing for the fact that the murder may not be strictly characterised as a contract killing, there is considerable force in the Crown's submission as to the objective gravity of the offence on the basis of the factors outlined at [43] above.  48The offender's decision to provide lethal force in furtherance of Tran's interests as, in effect, a business transaction, at a time when he was fully cognizant of the gravity of his behaviour, exhibits a very high degree of moral culpability.  The offender acted in furtherance of the agreement with Tran by killing the deceased and putting into effect the plan that the offender had formulated to conceal the offence and dispose of the body, if that need should arise.  49An assessment of the objective gravity of the offence takes place against the background of the factors established by the evidence on sentence.  That assessment is not assisted by enumerating a number of factors, referred to in the offender's submissions, that are not present in the commission of the offence, such as the fact that the offence was not a multiple killing, that it did not involve the shooting of a policeman, that it did not directly involve danger to other members of the public, that it did not involve children, that it was not a family killing, that it was not associated with any sexual assault, that it did not involve kidnapping or torture and that it was not a killing designed to frustrate the course of justice.  50I accept the Crown submission that the offence of murder lies within the upper portion of the range of objective gravity.  The sentence imposed for the offence of murder needs to reflect this level of objective gravity, in addition to general deterrence.  The murder was committed in broad daylight in circumstances where gunshots were heard by neighbours in suburban Sydney.  Gun related violence, as an adjunct of large-scale drug dealing, is sufficiently prevalent to engage general deterrence to a significant degree.  51The standard non parole period of 20 years imprisonment for the offence of murder therefore assumes some relevance as a benchmark or guide in the sentencing exercise.  In addition, the offences on the Form One, one of which is a serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment (destroy property by fire under s 195 Crimes Act 1900), must find some reflection in the sentence to be imposed on count 1 of the indictment. There are of course other factors at play, the most significant of which is the offender's claim to a substantial discount for assistance provided to the authorities.  Before passing to a consideration of this issue, I turn to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offences represented by counts 2, 3 and 4 on the indictment.  52The objective gravity of count 3 on the indictment is significant in and of itself.  The large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine formed part of the payment the offender received from Tran.  The evidence is silent on the question whether the offender intended to supply the methylamphetamine himself or whether he intended to return it to Tran, in the expectation that he would receive some payment.  The quantity represents almost three times the prescribed large commercial quantity.  53The presence of a quantity of cocaine in a number of different containers, the discovery of numerous SIM cards, the quantity of cash (the subject of the proceeds of crime charge) and the use by the offender of a false name, together support the conclusion that the offender was already engaged in the business of drug supply.  However, given that the possession of the methylamphetamine was a by-product of the contract with Tran that resulted in the murder, the objective gravity of the offence constituted by count 3 on the indictment in my view falls in the upper quartile of the lower half of the range represented by the maximum penalty.  The standard non parole period of 15 years for this offence has limited, if any, relevance in these circumstances.  54The possession of the shortened firearm is also an adjunct of the offender's drug dealing business.  Nevertheless, it is an offence that requires the imposition of a full-time term of imprisonment.  55The offence represented by count 4 on the indictment is based on the offender's possession for supply of a commercial quantity of cocaine.  The drugs found within the offender's van were packaged for supply.  The total amount is slightly less than 100 g above the commercial quantity.  I regard the objective gravity of this offence as falling slightly below the mid range of objective seriousness and would therefore regard the standard non parole period of 10 years as of minimal relevance to the sentencing exercise.  56I turn to the question of the extent and value of the offender's assistance to the authorities.  Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 guides the Court in terms of evaluating the discount to be applied where an offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities with respect to any offence.  The Court must take into account, relevantly, the effect of the offence committed by the offender on the victim and the family of the victim, the significance and usefulness of the offender's assistance, taking into consideration the evaluation by the authorities themselves of the assistance that is rendered or offered, the veracity, completeness and reliability of the information provided by the offender, the nature and extent of the offender's assistance or promised assistance, the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist, any benefit that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance, whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a result of giving assistance and whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender stands to be sentenced or an unrelated offence.  There is a limitation on the reduction of the sentence that is otherwise appropriate to reflect the criminality of the offender, namely, that the ultimate penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences.  57The Court of Criminal Appeal has stated on a number of occasions that the combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance should not normally exceed 50%, unless the matter can be described as truly exceptional.  It is common ground that the offender's assistance in this case does not fall within that category.  The differential in the discount applied to the sentences to be imposed on each of the four counts in order to reflect the pleas of guilty necessarily results in a different combined discount in respect of each offence.  In addition, the discounts to be applied for the purposes of s 23 must contain a discrete component relating to the promise of future assistance.  58Exhibits C and D set out the nature and extent of the offender's assistance to authorities.  Having regard to Exhibit C, the offender has not fully co-operated with respect to the provision of information in relation to the count 1 offence and in relation to the commission of other unrelated offences.  The nature of the assistance provided by the offender is regarded as qualified, in that the offender sought to minimise his own complicity in the commission of the murder and of various other offences, at the expense of nominating others.  With regard to exhibit D, and the evidence which was received in the course of sentencing proceedings on this issue, the offender's information is accepted to have been of general assistance in the investigation of unrelated matters.  Undoubtedly, the most significant assistance is yet to be provided by the evidence of the offender in the prosecution of Tran who is to stand trial for the murder of Paul Elliott on 29 August 2011.  59It is not disputed that the offender has placed himself and possibly members of his family in jeopardy as a result of the provision of assistance.  It is also not in dispute that the offender will serve his sentence in protective custody, which will render his conditions of imprisonment more onerous than they might otherwise have been.  It is not possible to determine precisely in what respect and to what extent the offender's custodial conditions will be restricted.  However, given the nature of the offender's criminal associations, I accept that there will be significant restrictions placed on the offender's access to programs and facilities within the prison system.  60Having regard to these matters, I have determined that the offender should receive a discount of 20% for his assistance to authorities, of which 12% is attributed to the offender's future assistance.  The resulting combined discount on the sentence to be imposed for the murder is one of 30%.  The resulting combined discount on the sentence to be imposed for each of the remaining offences on the indictment is one of 45%.  61I turn to a consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender.  The offender has no relevant prior convictions.  His criminal history consists entirely of summary traffic matters, but for a goods in custody offence in 2002 for which he received a fine.  62The offender is presently 42 years of age.  He is estranged from his father and two adult sisters.  He was educated in the Sutherland Shire and left school at the age of 15 years, which coincided with his mother's death and resultant estrangement from his father.  63He commenced a course at TAFE as an electrician but left after two years and undertook work as a male model for the following three years.  He was variously employed in the hospitality industry, the security industry and as a personal trainer, the last occupation resulting in the abuse of steroids in the course of training for world titles.  The offender has never married and has no children.  He has been in a de facto relationship over the past 15 years with Marion Wilford (Ex 3).  Ms Wilford has a 21-year-old daughter who has always regarded the offender as her father.  Both his partner and her daughter speak highly of the offender as a provider and father figure.  64The offender denies any abuse of alcohol.  He used amphetamines in his teenage years in addition to cocaine and ecstasy.  He denies having a serious addiction to drugs although it is apparent that he had a constant and regular habit.  The offender also consumed cannabis on a daily basis in order to sleep.  The offender says that he is now completely free of drugs and he is reflecting more clearly on his current circumstances.  A report under the hand of Tim Watson Munro (Ex 2) diagnoses the offender with a Chronic Adjustment Disorder with features of Post-Traumatic Stress.  It would appear that this condition has arisen largely as a result of the offender's arrest and incarceration.  65The offender has expressed his remorse in a handwritten letter (Exhibit 1).  In the course of that letter the offender states ""I take full responsibility for my part in the death of Mr Elliott and expect to be punished accordingly.""  I accept the letter as a genuine statement of remorse, albeit that it is not tested by cross-examination.  The offender's prospects of rehabilitation appears sound, if only on the basis that, by the time of the offender's release from gaol, he will no longer be an associate of those who engage in large-scale drug dealing.  The offender's criminality appears to be almost wholly related to his participation in that milieu.  66Having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances in respect of each of the offences, I would impose a head sentence of 30 years imprisonment on count 1 on the indictment, a sentence of 3 years imprisonment on count 2 of the indictment, a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on count 3 of the indictment and a sentence of 8 years imprisonment on count 4 of the indictment.  Applying the discounts that I have identified, the sentence for the offence of murder becomes one of 21 years imprisonment, the sentence for the firearms offence is one year and 8 months imprisonment, the sentence for the offence of supply large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is one of 6 years and 7 months imprisonment, and the sentence for the offence of supply commercial quantity of cocaine becomes one of 4 years and 5 months imprisonment.  67I am not persuaded that there is any principled basis for a finding of special circumstances.  The fact that this is the offender's first custodial sentence is not compelling and the offender's submission to the effect that his harsh custodial conditions warrant a change in the statutory proportion runs foul of the prohibition on double counting.  In any event, the length of the sentence that the offender is to serve will necessarily produce a balance of term that is more than sufficient for the purposes of allowing the offender to reintegrate himself into the community.  68A degree of accumulation is warranted, both to reflect the totality of the offender's criminality, and to reflect the fact that the supply commercial quantity of cocaine offence is unrelated to the remaining counts on the indictment.  I accept that the offence represented by count 3 on the indictment is an incident of the offender's agreement with Tran that gave rise to the murder.  69Taking all of these considerations into account, I impose the following sentences:-  (1)On count 1 on the indictment, a non parole period of 15 years and 3 months to date from 16 March 2011, expiring 15 June 2026, with a balance of term of 5 years and 9 months expiring 15 March 2032.  (2)On count 2 on the indictment, a fixed term of one year and 8 months imprisonment, to date from 16 December 2008, expiring 15 August 2010.  (3)On count 3 on the indictment, a non parole period of 5 years to date from 16 December 2008, expiring 15 December 2013, with a balance of term of one year and 7 months, expiring 15 July 2015.  (4)On count 4 on the indictment, a non parole period of 2 years and 3 months to date from 16 December 2008, expiring 15 March 2011, with a balance of term of 2 years and 2 months, expiring 15 May 2013.  70The offender is eligible for release on 16 June 2026.  71I order that the drugs the subject of the offences be destroyed;  save for the 2985.5 grams methylamphetamine the subject of Count 3 on the Indictment""  **********

2757494,R v Philip Wan Por Leung [2011] NSWSC 785,"Judgment  Introduction  1The accused stood trial for the manslaughter on 7 April 2007 of his partner.  On 28 April 2011 I directed the jury to bring in a verdict of not guilty.  At the time I gave a brief explanation for this direction and undertook to give more detailed reasons at a later date.  These are those reasons.  The legal test  2In Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 the High Court restated the applicable principle (at 212) -  ""There is no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct ... [a verdict of not guilty] if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict...""  It is now accepted in this State that, in deciding whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, the ""evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by contradicting, qualifying, or explaining"" the evidence supporting a conviction is to be disregarded: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 per Gleeson CJ (Maxwell and Wood JJ agreeing), adopting the view expressed by Mr Justice Glass in ""The Insufficiency of evidence to Raise a Case to Answer"" (1981) 55 ALJ 842.  The Chief Justice pointed out that this rule ""is the corollary of the proposition that it is for the jury to determine what parts of the evidence are to be accepted and what parts are to be rejected"", citing Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor [1982] AC 136 at 151.  3It follows that questions of credibility and reliability are for the jury to determine, not the judge.  Furthermore, the mere fact that, in a circumstantial case, it is possible to formulate a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence which the prosecution has failed to exclude cannot justify a direction that the jury should acquit if there is evidence upon which the accused could be convicted.  As was explained in Attorney-General's Reference (No 1 of 1983) [1983] 2 VR 410 at 416, the need to exclude hypotheses consistent with innocence is a mere restatement of the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt and whether there is a reasonable doubt is a matter for the jury; see also R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.  4It remains to note that that the evidence calling for assessment on a no case submission is the whole of the material capable of supporting the Crown case, especially where that case is circumstantial.  Factual background  5The following is a brief account, to some extent incomplete of course, of the evidence.  6The accused and the deceased had been in a relationship for some years, there is some evidence that the relationship had become fraught and that the deceased was contemplating bringing it to an end.  On 6 April 2007, they had an argument concerning the laying of some tiles, after which the accused stormed off.  However, there is evidence that, on the morning of 7 April 2011, the couple had consensual sexual relations.  7The evidence of a neighbour was read.  Her premises and those of the accused and the deceased shared a common wall.  She said she could hear loud noises from their premises, such as drilling, talking, loud vacuuming, chopping.  Between 8.15am and 8.30am on 7 April 2011, she heard a sound like a shelf falling, pots clanging and lids rolling around the floor.  The neighbour heard what she described as a shout or singing, adding that ""Mario sings opera from time to time, like high notes"", lasting ""five, eight seconds even"".  She later said, ""It could have been a word even, it was muffled, it was like - I don't know what it was - it was a shout or a roar, it could have been somebody saying something or crying out"".  She did not know which of the accused or the deceased it was.  In her statement to the police (made on 7 April 2011), the neighbour said that, following what sounded like pan lids continuing to roll around, ""I thought I heard Mario singing as he sang opera loud from time to time"" lasting for about ten seconds.  At about 8.45am (timing this by her husband's return to the house) she heard what seemed to be somebody crying like a child having a temper tantrum.  This went on for some time (and was certainly the accused).  There is no evidence one way or another as to where either the accused or the deceased were at the time of the sound of pots falling or the shout/singing noises, except that they were both in the house.  8At 9am a witness rang the home and the accused was hysterical.  At 9.12am the accused telephoned ""000"".  He was hysterical and incoherent and extremely difficult to understand.  The transcript records him as saying, ""I have a fight with my friend and my friend is dead"".  Witnesses arrived at the house at about 9.15am and saw the accused wailing or crying hysterically, cradling the deceased's head tightly, rocking back and forward, his arms around the deceased's neck and head.  The deceased was lying in a narrow corridor at the foot of some stairs.  The accused was in a state of extreme hysteria.  Ambulance officers arrived at 9.25 am.  The deceased's heart had stopped and resuscitation, which involved forceful CPR, was unsuccessful.  9Police found the metal bowl from a fruit juicer on the floor in clear sight about half a meter from the deceased's body.  It is clear that the juicer had been used at some time in the morning.  It was stained with a red colour that looked like and possibly was blood but there was no scientific evidence that it was blood.  Certainly, no blood was found on the floor near it.  The house was small with a deal of furniture and bric-a-brac, none of which looked as though it had been disturbed.  (The jury had the advantage of a view.)  The kitchen was also clean and tidy, though there was a mark on the plaster above the door opening onto the corridor, immediately opposite the bottom of the stairway was some plaster powder on the floor indicating that some hard object, very likely the juicer bowl, had struck and slightly damaged the wall.  A small number of bloodstains were found on the wall and timber frame near the body and on the stair handrail.  10The stairway which led from the first to the ground floor, at the bottom of which the accused was found cradling the deceased, was steep and narrow.  Something over a dozen stairs were separated by a small landing at a 90 degree change of direction.  A banister ran along the outside, supported by ornate turned balusters with small protruding bulbs and square bases with sharp edges.  The wall was uneven in parts with some protruding brickwork under plaster.  11The deceased was still wearing slip-on backless slippers, which would be highly unlikely after a fall downstairs, although it is quite possible that the accused put them back on the deceased.  12When, after some time, the accused was placed in the back of the police car, he was cautioned and asked, ""What happened this morning?""  The accused said, ""We had a fight"".  He was then asked, ""What was the fight about?"" and replied, ""I want my medication"" and said nothing further.  (The accused had been prescribed medication for depression.)  A support person was called to the police station shortly after arrival.  He spoke to the accused and told him that the police needed to know what happened.  He said that the accused was hysterical and couldn't stop sobbing.  The accused told him, however, ""I was making carrot juice with a juicer.  Mario kept at me"".  The accused's sobbing increased and he said something more about the juicer but the exact words could not be made out.  He added that he was holding Mario.  The support person continued trying to calm the accused down.  The accused was spoken to by police and said, when he was told he was under arrest and cautioned, ""No, I didn't murder him, he's not dead, he's only in hospital"".  The officer responded, ""No, Mario is dead.  Can you tell me what happened?""  The accused replied, ""I don't remember.  We have breakfast, Mario argue with me.  He criticise me a lot....Oh, Philip [a self reference].  Then my head start spinning.  Then I don't know what happened"".  The support person with the accused then discussed with the officer the need for legal advice and the conversation ended.  Medical evidence as to the cause of death  13Although the deceased did not die of natural causes, there was considerable uncertainty as to what caused his death.  The pathologist, Dr Botterill, concluded that death was caused by a blunt force injury/injuries to the head and/or neck area, perhaps a combination of the two. The deceased had some lesions, scratches and bruises on his body (particularly the upper chest, neck and chin areas), all relatively trivial in themselves.  14The pathologist's opinion was that, although any individual injury may have been caused by a simple fall from a standing position onto the floor, the extent and distribution of the injuries was in keeping with multiple blunt force contacts.  With a complex fall (as down the stairs, which the pathologist viewed for the first time before giving evidence in this trial) involving a lot of rotation and tumbling more injuries might occur but, even so, the distribution is not what he would expect.  If it were a single incident, the fall would be remarkably complex.  In short, a fall down the stairs might account for some or a number of the injuries but not all of them.   The most obvious injury was a complex laceration of about three centimetres to the edge of the chin which may have been caused by the juicer bowl.  In short, the head injuries are not inconsistent with being hit over the head with a blunt instrument, or with being hit on the chin by the juicer bowl, falling back and hitting the head or with falling down the stairs.  15The bruising to the neck demonstrated on reflection of the skin and shown in the tendered diagrams must be considered with caution.  Because bruising is the result of bleeding into the adjacent tissue, the area of bruising extends beyond the immediate site of the injury to the vessel that has been damaged.  The injuries to the neck are not inconsistent with strangulation although, given the absence of petechial haemorrhages and damage or fracture to the langio cartilages or the hyoid bone, it is an unusual strangulation, if it be one.  It may be consistent with pressure on the carotid sinus, causing the heart to slow and/or stop.  The bruising to the neck is also not inconsistent with falling down stairs if there were protruding items into or onto which the deceased fell.  Other possibilities would also include contact with the metal juice bowl, either at the bottom of the stairs or because the deceased was holding it and came in contact with it on the way down the stairs or at the bottom of the stairs and some may well have been caused by the attempted resuscitation.  Of course, these are not discrete alternatives.  So far as the blow to the chin which resulted in the complex laceration is concerned the pathologist concluded that it ""may be sufficient to explain the changes that were in the brain and, therefore, resulted in his death ... [but] I can't say in this case that the blow alone was enough to explain all of those changes, therefore, I can't say with certainty that it was just the blow to the chin that resulted in ... death"".  Death from such a blow is ""extremely uncommon"" but it depends on the way in which ""the body lands and certainly it is possible for a relatively minor head injury, particularly if the airway is compromised, for subsequent death to occur"".  16Significantly, the pathologist said that ""[i]t's conceivable that any of the injuries could have occurred within a day or so of [the] time of death and they would effectively look the same to me"".  So far as the abrasions were concerned, he could not say ""that they hadn't all occurred around the same time or time span of what is perhaps up to about a day"".  If the neck injuries, for example had occurred four hours before death, then he would defer to the head injuries as causing death and vice versa.  The head injuries, however, may have occurred between four and eight hours before and still have had a role to play.  He said that the most serious injuries were those to the deceased's head, whether it be the chin or areas of bruising to the back that resulted in the transmission of force to cause the bleeding over the brain surface.  The other brain changes were also significant.  He concluded that the aggregate of those areas of bruising over the neck had the potential to, either by compression of arteries supplied to the brain or by pressure involving the carotid sinus, cause cardiac arrhythmia but stated ""which [of the head or neck injuries] was more responsible for his death, I can't say"".  He agreed that the more serious of the two (the head injuries) ""plainly can be caused by falling downstairs and hitting your head"".  He was then asked -  ""Q In terms of the global picture though, all of those injuries, this is globally we are talking about, all of those injuries can be explained by a fall down those stairs and then having misguided resuscitation attempts made on the body once its been at the bottom of the stairs and that would explain all the injuries, wouldn't it?  ...  A. Yes, the whole combination together could explain the injuries that are there, yes.""  17Dr Rodriguez testified to brain injuries suffered by the deceased, caused by blunt force injury, being a knock to the head either by the application of force to the head by a blunt object or the head hitting a hard object, eg a stair or a wall.  He accepted that the brain injuries, of themselves, would not necessarily cause death and ""there is some doubt as to exactly why this person died at the time he did"", but thought there was a direct link to the blunt force injuries.  The blunt force injuries to the head could have been caused by falling down some stairs.  He was unable to say whether the deceased died from brain injuries.  The Crown case  18The Crown, in brief, submitted that the medical and scientific evidence, the timeline, the tension in the relationship, the lack of any other person with opportunity, what was heard by the neighbour and the statements of the accused permitted the inference that the deceased was strangled and/or hit over the head (either with the juicer bowl or otherwise) by the accused although it is unclear in which order these acts are said to have occurred.  (Given that the accused was on trial for manslaughter and not murder, the possible financial gain that might have been a motive was not relied on.)  19The mere fact that, of two possible explanations for the deceased's death, the Crown cannot prove it was one or the other is immaterial, as long as both can be laid at the hand of the accused.  Alternatively (though this argument was not put), as long as the evidence permits the jury to conclude that whatever was done last was done by the accused and that caused death, then there is a case to answer subject, of course, to there being a basis for inferring that the act was intentional, not done in self-defence, and a reasonable person would appreciate that it carried ""an appreciable risk of serious injury"" ( Wilson v R (1992) 174 CLR 313).  Discussion  20It is clear that identification of the cause of death or the precise acts that resulted in that cause need not be identified in every case, though it is obviously usually necessary to do so in order to show that it is the accused who was responsible.  Here, the crucial question is whether the deceased's death was caused by the unlawful and dangerous act of the accused.  There can be no doubt that answering this question requires focus on what the jury are able, as a matter of common sense and reason, to conclude from the evidence as a whole.  The mere fact that the Crown case is possible could not, of course, justify a conviction.  The evidence must be such that the accused could, though not necessarily would, lawfully be convicted upon it: May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; (1955) 92 CLR 654 at [7].  21It is important, indeed crucial, to understand that reasoning by inference is an essential part of the jury's consideration of the charge and that this may not always be capable of clear articulation, as is evidenced by the injunction frequently given that common sense has a significant part to play in drawing inferences.  Of course, technical medical evidence is not a matter of common sense but of expertise, though its significance may well depend on common sense inferences derived from other material.  That material, and how it impinges on or is affected by the medical evidence and, ultimately on the issues in the case, are matters for the jury to evaluate.  Given the time frame in which it is possible that the injuries were suffered and the uncertainties of the cause of death, the surrounding circumstances - so far as there is evidence of them, are crucially important.  Thus, for example, the juicer bowl may have inflicted the laceration to the deceased's chin, but was it wielded by the accused and, if so, in what circumstances?  If he had used it, why did he leave it there in full sight and, if it were bloodstained, why was there no blood on the floor?  If the deceased fell down the stairs why did the accused not mention it?  This would require consideration, amongst other things, of his mental state at the time he spoke.  If saucepans falling to the floor explains the noise heard by the neighbour, how did this happen and what inferences arose from it?  Was it merely the sound of the juicer bowl hitting the floor and, if so (since it was thrown at the wall above the kitchen door), who threw it and why?  Did it cause an injury to the deceased and, if so, in what circumstances?  For example, did it cause any serious injury or one or more that was or were relevant to the deceased's death?  Did the deceased fall down the stairs and could this event occur independently of the accused and, if not, did the accused do it deliberately or accidentally or in self defence?.  I mention these matters by way of example only - the range of factual issues is much wider of course.  At the end of the day, one must remain acutely aware that inferences may be able to bridge any apparent gaps in the Crown case.  22Accepting, however, that there is no bright line separating ""conjecture"" from common sense or inferential reasoning, the evidence must be such as to enable a lawful verdict of guilt.  Much might be left uncertain but a judge must direct acquittal where, in his or her view, a guilty verdict would necessarily involve inadmissible conjecture.  Inevitably, this will be a matter of fact and degree.  In some cases, the multiplication of circumstances, taken together (though ignoring those matters that assist the accused), will be capable of leading to a conclusion of sufficient certainty to justify conviction, in which event, there is a case to answer.  Here, however, the number of possibilities and the varying inferences available if one or another path of reasoning be followed add to uncertainty rather than reduce it.  The choice of path is fraught with considerable doubt and each has substantial gaps.  So far as the medical evidence pertaining to the event or events that caused death, a very significant complicating feature is the evidence, not given at the first trial, of the 24-hour time frame in which the injuries may have been suffered.   Amongst other things, this made it distinctly less important than it earlier appeared that a fall down the stairs almost certainly did not explain all the injuries.  23In the result, I concluded that the evidence taken at its highest for the Crown inevitably left significant gaps in the possible lines of reasoning to a conclusion of guilt that could not be bridged without impermissible conjecture.  It followed that the accused could not lawfully be convicted.  Accordingly, I directed a verdict of acquittal.  **********

		03 August 2011",2011-07-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757506,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Walford [2011] NSWSC 759,"Judgment 

1The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against an order of Magistrate Eckhold in the Dubbo Local Court on 25 January 2011 excluding visual identification evidence of a witness. The witness was the complainant in respect of an alleged breach of an apprehended violence order by the Defendant. 

2The issue on the appeal was the proper construction of s 114(2) Evidence Act 1995. 

Background 

3On 10 December 2009 the Defendant was alleged to have assaulted the Complainant at a gathering at a mutual friend's house. The Defendant and Complainant did not previously know each other prior to that date. 

4As a result of the alleged assault the Defendant was arrested, and the police applied for and were granted a provisional apprehended violence order in respect of the Defendant for the protection of the Complainant. One of the conditions of the provisional AVO was that the Defendant was not to go within 100 metres of the premises at which the Complainant might from time to time reside or work or other specified premises being 14 Lovett Avenue, Dubbo. 

5The provisional AVO became an interim AVO by virtue of an order of Dubbo Local Court made on 24 February 2010. 

6On 25 March 2010 the Complainant informed the police that the Defendant had breached the AVO by approaching her residential apartment block and looking towards her apartment on the day of that complaint. She had observed the Defendant from a neighbour's apartment next door to her apartment. 

7The Defendant was subsequently arrested on 20 October 2010 and charged with knowingly contravening a prohibition specified in an apprehended violence order. 

The evidence before the Magistrate 

8The charge came on for a defended hearing on 25 January 2011 at Dubbo Local Court. At the outset of the proceedings the Defendant's solicitor informed the Court that identification was the issue in the matter. The Statement of the police informant, Senior Constable Ben Robinson, was tendered by consent and Senior Constable Robinson was briefly cross-examined. 

9The Complainant was then called to give evidence. The transcript relevantly discloses the following: 

Q. Now ma'am do you know Mr Aaran Walford? 
A. No. 

Q. Do you mean by that you don't know him personally? 
A. No not personally, I mean besides what happened. 

Q. Besides what happened okay. If I take you back to Thursday 25 March of last year. At the time was there an apprehended violence order between yourself and Mr Walford? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And he was the defendant and you're what's referred to as a protected person? 
A. (No verbal reply). 

HIS HONOUR 

Q. You nodded, that's yes? 
A. Yes. 

PROSECUTOR 

Q. I'll just ask you to keep your voice as loud as possible ma'am. The microphone doesn't actually amplify it just records? 
A. Okay. 

Q. Now about 5pm on 25 March you were at a friend's house is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And where is that friend's house in relation to your house? 
A. Next door to me. 

Q. Next door? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. And what did you see if anything when you were at your friend's house? 
A. It's a bit hard to remember - I can't really remember anything really. 

Q. Are you able to see your premises or your house from your friend's house? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And could you see anyone at or near your house? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And are you able to say who that person was? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And who was it? 
A. Aaran Crawford (as said). 

JULIAN: At this point I'm objecting to that response. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. Yes all right now I think we need to have a voir dire about the evidence, because the evidence that she has given is that she identified a person called Aaran who I anticipate for obvious reasons who that might be. 

10Thereafter a voir dire was held in which the following evidence was given by the Complainant: 

PROSECUTOR 

Q. Now before that day you'd met Mr Walford is that right? 
A. Yes I think. I can't really remember. 

Q. You can't really remember? 
A. No it's too far away, too long ago. 

Q. Are you saying - 
A. I just remember the events that happened, like the assault wise stuff. 

Q. Okay an assault? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Now if I take - I want you to think about that day? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. And that assault. Had you seen Mr Walford before that day? 

HIS HONOUR 
Q. Before the day of the assault? 
A. I think just around. 

PROSECUTOR 

Q. If you had it was just around? 
A. Yeah. 

11The Complainant then gave evidence of the original assault that led to the imposition of the AVO. After having described the assault and the fact that she rang the police, the Complainant gave the following evidence: 

Q. Did you see him again? 
A. Yes out the front. He was - I think he was taking his shirt off to egg people on. 

Q. So you were taking notice of what he was doing? 
A. Yeah because- 

Q. You were watching him? 
A. Yes. I was on the phone to my girlfriend. 

Q. And how did you feel after being assaulted? 
A. Upset, hurt. 

Q. Were you worried at all in relation to being assaulted again? 
A. Yes, him being out the front. 

Q. Him being out the front? 
A. Yep. 

Q. So you were watching him? 
A. Yes. 

... 

Q. On the day of the assault I think you said that you were worried about where he was after being assaulted, you were on the phone to your girlfriend, you were watching him? 
A. Yeah yeah. 

Q. And was that because - why was that? 
A. Because he was out the front. 

12She was then asked when she had seen him subsequent to the assault and this evidence was given: 

Q. And when was the next time you saw him. Was that the day you saw him at your house or did you see him before then? 
A. Yeah I've - I've seen him after the assault and stuff. 

Q. You've seen him after the assault? 
A. Yeah going next door across to me. 

Q. In the same block of flats? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Okay and did you ring the police on those occasions? 
A. Yeah I have a couple of times and my neighbour has. 

... 

Q. Okay today you gave evidence that you were at your friend's house and you saw him walk near your house? 
A. Yes he was going to flat four but he wasn't home. 

Q. To flat four? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. And what flat are you? 
A. Flat 10. 

Q. And so when you saw him how far away were you from him? 
A. I was in flat nine so he would have been probably from me to where he is now. 

Q. What about you to where Mr Walford is now? 
A. Yeah. 

HIS HONOUR: Seven metres. 

13In cross-examination on the voir dire she gave this evidence: 

Q. And prior to that day 10 December 2009 you'd never met Mr Walford before had you? 
A. No. 

Q. You'd never come across him before had you? 
A. No I don't think - I don't know, no. Probably seen him around, that's it. 

Q. But you can't definitely say that you'd seen him around? 
A. No, no. 

... 

Q. You weren't able to tell the police officers the name of the person that had assaulted you is that right? 
A. No because I didn't know him. 

Q. And you only know Mr Walford's name because you were given a copy of the AVO papers and that's how you learn of his name is that right? 
A. Yes, my neighbours know him. 

Q. So after that night in December 2009 you became aware of his name is that right? 
A. Yes. 

... 

Q. And since that night and up until you say that you saw Mr Walford on 25 March last year you hadn't come across Mr Walford before had you? 
A. No I'm not sure, no. After the assaults and that I kept seeing him walk past my house, because I know where he was going. He jumped the fence. 

Q. When you- 
A. I see him a few times doing it. Him and his cousin or brother over there. 

... 

Q. But it's true that you had been between December of 2009 and March 2010 you'd been mostly staying at other people's house and not your own is that right? 
A. Yep when I do come home my property, my clothes and stuff, I do see him. 

14Senior Constable Robinson was then recalled and gave evidence on the voir dire as follows: 

Q. Senior Constable you're the officer in charge of this matter? 
A. Yeah that's correct. 

Q. Was there an identification parade held? 
A. No. 

Q. As part of your investigation? 
A. No. 

Q. Was there a reason for that? 
A. Because the victim knew who the offender was. 

Q. And what gave you that impression or gave you that belief? 
A. Just in regards to when I actually went to get the statement off her she just said his name straight out, it was him and because of the previous dealings that she'd had with him I believe that there wouldn't be any issue in that regard. 

Q. Was there any suggestion in the manner of her speech or the manner of identification that gave you cause to doubt otherwise? A. No there was nothing indicating that she didn't know who it was no. 

15Argument then took place about the admissibility of the identification evidence. 

The Magistrate's reasons 

16The Magistrate gave his reasons for excluding the evidence as follows: 

It is surprisingly difficult for a relatively minor manner (sic) as we have described it to adequately determine this. I think the scheme of the Evidence Act sets out a presumption that there will not be identification evidence admitted unless there has been a visual identification parade. Now that parade involves the potential of choosing amongst a number of other people and unsurprisingly it may in fact be a matter of informal policy or the policy of the particular officer, I do not know but it would be generally the case in apprehended violence order matters that an identification parade would be completely useless because the two persons would have - that is in a domestic violence context, would know each other very well but an apprehended personal violence order, which I take it this matter was, then it can be very different and this is a matter where the relationship between the two was not as strong as would normally exist, if I can put it that way, in an apprehended violence order. 

So the question arises in this particular case, looking at it specifically as to the relationship between the complainant witness who identified the defendant and that is the sole evidence in the case I might add, as to whether it was reasonable under s 114(2B) - sorry whether it was not reasonable to have had such a parade held. 

In factoring into account whether it was reasonable or not I have to take into account a range of different factors. The kind of offence, which in this case we have said on numerous occasions this is of lower gravity in the criminal calendar. The importance of the evidence in this case, it is in fact crucial as the identification is the only evidence of a breach that is alleged of the apprehended violence order. And lastly the practicality of holding an identification parade - sorry second last having the identification parade in relation to evidence, as to whether the identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence among other things. And lastly the appropriateness of having an identification parade, having regard among other things to the relationship between the defendant and the person that made the identification. 

Now one of the things that has been set out in the case law that I have described is a question as to what rational effect it would have had if there had been identification made in this case and I have evidence before me of the original identification by the complainant in the assault matter that saw the apprehended violence order created, which was it was a person who was fair, cross-eyed, had a beard and Aboriginal and wearing I think a yellow shirt and that constituted the evidence of identification in that particular case. 

The order was made. Now no doubt the stand to the order being made (sic) is not a relevant consideration except that it is not a criminal conviction in and of itself. I do not know if there was any criminal conviction that flowed as a consequence of the alleged assault. 

It is a matter which I have found difficult, not least because of the background of public policy involved which would potentially see police wondering whether they needed to have an identification parade in every case where there is an alleged breach of an apprehended personal violence order. But I do not think this case would really bear upon that question generally. It is restricted to this case and cases of this sort where there is not really any relationship between the defendant and the witness whose evidence is crucial of visual identification, as to whether an identification parade would have been required or not. 

I think it was reasonable to expect in the circumstances an identification parade would have been held and I say that because what has failed to be excluded from this case is the possibility that the witness has incorrectly identified the person she saw as being the defendant, both on the last occasion and on previous occasions that she called police . If she had had the identification parade it would have been possible to determine whether she correctly recognised the defendant from that previous assault or not and at this stage that possibility is not available to the defendant and it will no longer be possible because of course she has seen him here today whilst giving evidence. 

So I think that restricted solely to this particular case and to matters of this sort where there is no prior relationship of any significance between the defendant and between the witness who identifies them, it is a matter where I should exclude the evidence because an identification parade should have been held. Now I note that this is in no way any authority ... (not transcribable) ... anyone anyway because it is the Local Court but it is no way authority for any proposition that in all cases of an apprehended violence order breaches an identification parade should be held. In most cases there would be a significant relationship between the defendant and the witness, said to identify somebody in a breach proceeding and in this case there was not such a relationship and it is unusual in that regard. 

SO THAT EVIDENCE OF IDENTIFICATION IS EXCLUDED. (emphasis added) 


Legislation 

17Section 114 Evidence Act provides: 

114 Exclusion of visual identification evidence 

(1) In this section: 

visual identification evidence means identification evidence relating to an identification based wholly or partly on what a person saw but does not include picture identification evidence. 

(2) Visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless: 

(a) an identification parade that included the defendant was held before the identification was made, or 

(b) it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade, or 

(c) the defendant refused to take part in such a parade, 
and the identification was made without the person who made it having been intentionally influenced to identify the defendant. 

(3) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court in determining whether it was reasonable to hold an identification parade, it is to take into account: 

(a) the kind of offence, and the gravity of the offence, concerned, and 

(b) the importance of the evidence, and 

(c) the practicality of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things: 

(i) if the defendant failed to cooperate in the conduct of the parade - to the manner and extent of, and the reason (if any) for, the failure, and 

(ii) in any case - to whether the identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence, and 

(d) the appropriateness of holding an identification parade having regard, among other things, to the relationship (if any) between the defendant and the person who made the identification. 

(4) It is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade if it would have been unfair to the defendant for such a parade to have been held. 

(5) If: 

(a) the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade unless an Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel acting for the defendant, or another person chosen by the defendant, was present while it was being held, and 

(b) there were, at the time when the parade was to have been conducted, reasonable grounds to believe that it was not reasonably practicable for such an Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel or person to be present, 

it is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade at that time. 

(6) In determining whether it was reasonable to have held an identification parade, the court is not to take into account the availability of pictures or photographs that could be used in making identifications. 

18The difference between the parties turned on what is meant by the words ""before the identification was made"" in s 114(2). The DPP contends that in a case such as the present, where the Complainant had asserted that the person who approached her flat was the Defendant, she had identified the Defendant at that point so that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade. This is because it would have been impossible to have held an identification parade before that identification was made. 

19On the other hand, the Defendant contends that the words ""before the identification was made"" should not be read literally but should be read in the context of this whole Part of the Evidence Act with particular reference to the warnings that are required to be given in s 116. The result, the Defendant submits, is that the words should be interpreted to mean ""before the relevant witness gives visual identification evidence in Court"". The Defendant submits that if the words were read literally an identification parade would never be necessary in a case involving ""recognition evidence"" because it would never be reasonable to hold a parade before the identification was made because the police would never know the recognition was to occur. Moreover, it is said that the words in s 114(3)(d) the relationship (if any) between the defendant and the person who made the identification would be meaningless and would have no work to do. 

20In my opinion, the Defendant's submission should not be accepted. In my opinion the Magistrate fell into error by not making a finding concerning when identification was first made and by confusing the weight to be accorded to the identification by the Complainant with the issue of whether the evidence ought to be excluded. My reasons are these. 

21First, although the word ""identification"" is not defined in the Dictionary identification evidence is defined in this way: 

identification evidence means evidence that is: 

(a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where: 

(i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed, or 

(ii) an act connected to that offence was done, 

at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time, or 

(b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion. 

22Such a definition is entirely consistent with the ordinary dictionary definition of the word identify which is: 
Treat (in) as identical (with); associate (person, oneself) inseparably or very closely with (party, policy, etc); establish identity of, recognise; select by consideration. 


The reasonableness of not holding a parade 

23The first question, therefore, is when any identification of the Defendant was made. The evidence of the Complainant was that she had asserted that the person who approached the block of flats was the Defendant. In my view such an assertion amounted to an identification by the Complainant of the Defendant. That is consistent with the definition of identification evidence . The assertion was made to the police on 25 March 2010. The assertion having been made at that time (at or about the time of the commission of the offence) it is inescapable that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade. 

24Secondly, contrary to the Defendant's submissions, a literal reading of the words before the identification was made is supported by the remainder of the section. That the ""identification"" is not referring simply to the identification given in evidence at the hearing finds support in sub-s (3)(c)(ii) which expressly envisages that the identification can be made out of court and at about the time of the commission of the offence. The inclusion of that matter as a consideration in the determination of the reasonableness of the holding of an identification parade supports the overall purpose of the section. This shows that the reference to identification being made in sub-s (2) is not a reference only to identification in court. 

25Thirdly, a number of cases supports the construction of the section put forward by the DPP. In DPP v Donald [1999] NSWSC 949 the Complainant was robbed by 3 young women on or about 12 November 1998. On 28 November 1998 the complainant was driving her car when she saw 2 of the women and recognised them as 2 of those who had robbed her. She reported the matter to the police and they were arrested. Her evidence as to identification of the 2 women was held by the Magistrate to be inadmissible because there had been no identification parade. 

26On appeal, Bell J said: 

[7] The identification, upon which the prosecution relied, was the act of identification prior to the arrest of the two defendants. It was not possible for the police to have held an identification parade prior to that time. 

[8] Section 114(2) provides that visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless: 

[9] (a) An identification parade including the defendant was held before the identification was made or 

(b) it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade or 

(c) that the defendant refused to take part in such a parade, and the identification was made without the person who made it having been intentionally influenced to identify the defendant. 

[10] Under s 114(2)(a) and subject to sub-paras (b) and (c), evidence of identification will not be admissible unless an identification parade was held ""before the identification was made"". The identification upon which the prosecution relied was made when Mrs Flinders first saw the defendants on 28 November. Having regard to this circumstance it is an irresistible conclusion that s 114(2)(b) applied and the evidence of Ms Flinders as to visual identification was not rendered inadmissible for the want of an identification parade. 

27But Bell J went further because she then said: 

[11] I consider there is considerable force in the submissions advanced by Mr Berman, who appears on behalf of the informant, that had the police arranged an identification parade following the arrest of the two defendants any identification made at that parade by Ms Flinders might be said to have been contaminated by her earlier identification of the two women: Alexander v Queen (1981) 145 CLR 359 at 409; R v Carusi (1997) 192 A Crim R 52 at 55; and R v Clarke (1998) 97 A Crim R 414. 

28In R v Thomason [1999] ACTSC 112 a security officer at a hotel saw a man strike another customer in the face with a glass. After calling for an ambulance, the security officer saw the man again and identified him to another person as the man who had attacked the customer. The prosecution proposed to call the witness to give evidence of his identification of the accused as the attacker but the defence argued that the evidence should be excluded under s 114 because no identification parade had been held. 

29Miles CJ said this: 

[8] I ruled initially that the evidence proposed to be called was visual identification evidence within s114 and that it was inadmissible because no identification parade had been held as required by s114(2)(a). The ruling was not accompanied by a statement of reasons, but my reasons would have emerged during discussion with counsel during submissions. The submissions of counsel concentrated on the question whether the evidence proposed to be called was visual identification evidence within the meaning of the section, and my attention was not drawn to s114(2)(b). 

[9] Overnight I became aware of the provisions of s114(2)(b). Without the assistance of further submissions, I formed the provisional view that it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade before the identification of the person in question by John Daniel to the other member of the hotel staff, since the identification took place only a few minutes, at the most, after the attack on the customer and before police arrived. I therefore concluded that I was in error in ruling the evidence inadmissible under s114. However, I formed the further provisional view that to give leave for the evidence to be called on the second day of the trial would have been to give it unfair emphasis and that accordingly its prejudicial effect against the accused outweighed its probative value, and thus, although admissible, it should not be admitted into the trial. 

30In R v D [2008] ACTSC 82 the Complainant was assaulted in December 2006 near some shops. He immediately went to his workplace at the shops and told workmates that he had been assaulted by the Defendant. The next day he reported the assault to the police and again named the Defendant as one of his assailants. The Complainant knew the Defendant because they had attended the same primary school for some years. It was sought to exclude the evidence of identification of the Defendant. 

31During the course of the trial counsel for the Defence objected to identification evidence by the Complainant on the basis that s 114 applied to exclude it. Penfold J refused the application to exclude the evidence and subsequently provided her reasons. She first determined that the words ""such a parade"" in s 114(2)(b) were a reference back to the parade described in para (a). She then said this: 

[12] My next step was to interpret ""the identification"" as used in para (b) to mean the act of identifying the defendant in some way as the person whom the witness could link in some way to the offence (that is, making an assertion of the kind described in para (a) of the definition of ""identification evidence"" in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act). 

[13] Paragraphs 114(2)(a) and (c) had no direct application to the case, and there was no suggestion that the complainant had been intentionally influenced to identify D. Accordingly, the operation of s 114(2) in this case turned entirely on whether par 114(2)(b) was satisfied. 

[14] The report to the complainant's workmates, and then the formal complaint to the police the next day, both included a naming of D as the assailant. I considered this to be an identification for the purpose of para 114(2)(a). On that basis, it would not have been possible for an identification parade that included D to have been held before the identification was made. Having concluded that such a parade would have been impossible to hold, I found that it would, in the words of para 114(2)(b), not have been reasonable to have held it. Therefore, the test in para 114(2)(b) was satisfied and evidence of that identification was not inadmissible under s 114. 

32The Defendant relied on a decision of Rares J when his Honour sat as a Judge of the Supreme Court of the ACT in R v Benjamin John Taylor [2008] ACTSC 52. In that case the Crown sought to lead identification evidence from 2 witnesses who had known the Accused for a period prior to the occasion of the alleged offence. They gave evidence on the voir dire that on the day of the offence they saw the Accused driving a vehicle away from the Complainant's property. 
33Rares J in para [14] identified the issue as: 

Whether the evidence proposed to be given is evidence of an identification which was made before any identification parade could have been held within the meaning of s 114(2) of the Evidence Act . 

He referred to the 2 bases upon which the Crown sought to make the evidence admissible. The first and only relevant basis for present purposes was that the statements that had been made by the witnesses prior to the trial were the ""identification"" to which the definition in s 114(1) applied and thus the ""identification"" referred to in s 114(2)(a). 

34His Honour went on to say: 

[22] In s 114(1) the further definition of ""visual identification evidence"" captures what already exists as ""identification evidence"", and refines it to a particular kind of identification evidence, namely, that ""relating to an identification based wholly or partly on what a person saw ..."" (my emphasis). The words ""relating to"" are words of wide import: cf Fountain v Alexander (1982) 150 CLR 615 at 629 per Mason J. The question is what does ""an identification"" in that definition mean? The Crown argued it means simply the act of identification at the original time it occurred and not the assertion referred to as part of the definition of identification evidence. 

[23] I am of opinion that the natural and ordinary meaning of the word ""identification"" when used in the definition in s 114(1) must be the particular identification in the identification evidence, that is, the assertion of the witness that the accused is the person connected to the crime the subject of the dictionary definition. 

[24] In Clifford v R [2004] TASSC 16 at [26] Crawford J, with whom Underwood and Slicer JJ agreed, referred to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Smith [2000] NSWCCA 468 at [83]-[89] and cited what was said by Wood CJ at CL with whom the other members of the Court of Criminal Appeal agreed. The Chief Judge said in Smith [2000] NSWCCA 468 at [83]: 

Viewed literally, every criminal trial involves identification evidence within the wide meaning given to that phrase in the dictionary to the Evidence Act . The evidence of any eye witness who gives evidence, based upon his or her own observations, that the accused was present at the place where the offence charged occurred, falls literally within that definition. Yet common sense would suggest, in such a case, where such evidence was not in issue, that there would [be] little if any point served in giving the s 116(1) direction."" (emphasis added) 

[25] Here, of course, such evidence is in issue. I am of opinion that the words ""an identification"" as used in s 114(1) apply to the identification, the subject of the identification evidence; that is the in court assertion that the accused was the person relevantly at the crime scene at the relevant time. Likewise, I am of opinion that when s 114(2)(a) refers to the requirement that an identification parade, including the defendant, be held ""before the identification was made"", it is referring to such a parade occurring prior to the giving of the identification evidence as defined in the dictionary to the Act. It is common ground that no identification parade was ever held or, as far as the evidence reveals, contemplated in respect of Daniel or Jesse Robinson (or indeed Mr Isaac Nash-Basnet who the Crown said in the course of argument today will not be asked about this in-chief). 

[26] The Crown suggested that it would have been unreasonable to have held such a parade for two reasons. First, the Crown said that the contemporaneous identification made by each of the witnesses precluded any utility in, or practical ability to hold, an identification parade prior to the police ever knowing about the circumstances of the offence which the two witnesses were alleged to be observing. 

[27] I reject that argument on the basis of the construction I have given to s 114(2)(a). That permits the identification parade to be held at any time prior to the witness entering the witness box. Such a view appears to be consistent with other decisions, although those are given in different contexts: see eg. R v David Taufua (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 November 1996 per Barr J, with whom Priestley AP and James J agreed, BC 9605430). 

35With great respect to Rares J I neither agree with his conclusion that the words ""an identification"" is a reference to the in-court assertion by the witness where there has been an earlier out-of-court identification, nor to the support he says that R v David Taufua ( supra ) provides for the view to which he came. As Penfold J pointed out in R v D at [28]-[29], Barr J in Taufua distinguished between in-court identification and other identification, and noted also that on the facts of that case the witness had not given any visual identification before his in-court identification. A similar distinction can be inferred from R v Tahere [1999] NSWCCA 170 at [27]. 

36In my opinion the scheme of the section is understood by looking to when the ""identification"" is first made by the witness. In that regard the ""identification"" is to be contrasted with the ""identification evidence"". If the witness has made an out-of-court identification it is at that time at which the reasonableness of holding the identification parade is to be considered. If the identification is made at or about the time of the commission of the offence the Court will have to consider whether it was not reasonable to have held a parade. If the identification was made at the time of the commission of the offence (e.g. a witness telephoning the police and identifying the person), it will clearly not have been reasonable to hold a parade because it will not have been practicable to do so. The words ""or about the time of the commission of the offence"" are sufficiently elastic that they may embrace more than minutes or even hours, and in some cases a few days where the investigation is lengthy. In such cases it will not have been impossible to hold such a parade and the matters in sub-s (3)(c)(ii) will need to be considered in determining whether it was not reasonable to hold one. 

37If the identification, however, occurs for the first time in Court the provisions of s 114(2) will be clearly engaged as in Taufua . Indeed, it was against the giving of that sort of evidence for the first time in Court that the provision was enacted. In that regard, I respectfully agree with the whole of Penfold J's careful analysis of Taylor and Taufua and of her statutory interpretation and policy considerations at [20]-[58] in her judgment in R v D . 

38The Defendant submits that, if the relevant visual identification evidence is evidence of a witness that it was a particular person who assaulted the complainant (which the Defendant called ""recognition evidence"" following R v Trudgett (2007) 70 NSWLR 696), then in no such case would the words concerning the relationship in sub-s (3)(d) have work to do. This appears to be because it would be impossible to hold a parade before that identification was made, and so one would never reach the stage of having to consider the relationship issue in sub-s (3). 

39I do not agree. In coming to the view about whether it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade the relationship between the parties would still have to be considered. That would involve a consideration of when, how well, and in what circumstances the witness knew the person said to be the Defendant. That would have to be determined before it could be ascertained that there had been an ""identification"" by the witness. I accept that in cases where there has been an ""identification"" in an out-of-court statement one would no longer consider the relationship issue. 

40But in any event, even if those words have no work to do in the sort of case described, there are other cases where there would be a need to consider the relationship to determine if it was reasonable not to have held the parade. As in Taufua the witness may give evidence that a person's appearance was like the Defendant's, or that he thought he recognised the person. In such a case there may not have been identification by the witness but the issue of the relationship between the witness and the Defendant would be part of the consideration of the reasonableness or not of holding the identification parade: Taufua at p.11 (""despite a degree of familiarity ...""). See also Regina v Fredrick Valdez Ford (unreported - Sup Ct NSW, Barr J - 22 April 1998). 

41The Defendant submits that I should take into account what the Australian Law Reform Commission said in its final Report which led to the Evidence Act at para [187] as follows: 

[187] Recommendation. Consideration has been given to providing more guidance as to what may or may not be 'reasonable'. For example, if the eyewitness saw someone he or she knew committing the crime, there would be little point in holding a parade. It is not possible, however, to draft an exception on this basis because of the range of knowledge or acquaintance that may be involved in particular cases. Similar problems arise in drafting an exception where the defendant refuses to co-operate. The proposals have been amended, however, to make it clear that, in deciding the reasonableness question, the appropriateness of holding a parade is a separate consideration and it is relevant to consider whether the suspects refused to co-operate, whether the identification was made at or about the time of the offence and the relationship between the defendant and the identifier. Subject to these changes it is recommended that the interim proposals be implemented. 

42The Defendant submits that s 3(3) Evidence Act permits the use of this material. The sub-section is, however, subject to s 34 Interpretation Act 1987 which applies ""if any material not forming part of the Act or statutory rule is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision"". I do not consider that such a situation obtains in the present case. There does not seem to me to be ambiguity in s 114 nor any particular difficulty in construing it. 

43The Defendant draws particular attention to what is said in para 187 of the ALRC report that it is not possible to draft an exception on the basis that an eyewitness saw someone whom he or she knew committing the offence. However, as is made clear later in the paragraph, when the reasonableness of holding the parade is considered the relationship between the defendant and the identifier (if any) becomes relevant. Accordingly, even if resort was to be had to para 187 of the ALRC Report, it does not appear to me to provide any support for the Defendant's principal contention that the identification with which s 114 is concerned is only identification in-court on the basis that in recognition cases there is no work for sub-s (3)(d) to do. 

44In the present case Senior Constable Robinson gave evidence that the Complainant had identified the Defendant to him when he went to get a statement by saying his name. The Complainant had given evidence that she had seen the Defendant between the date of the assault and the time when he approached her house and she rang the police. She also gave evidence that it was the Defendant out the front of her house taking his shirt off to egg people on. In all of those circumstances the Complainant had identified the Defendant, and that identification (i.e. an assertion by her to the effect that the Defendant was present at the place where the offence for which the Defendant was being prosecuted was committed) took place at or about the time of the commission of the offence. 

45The Magistrate appears to have proceeded on the basis that the identification referred to in s 114(2)(a) was the identification made by the Complainant in Court when she said that the person that she saw near her house was Aaran Crawford. Nowhere does he say that her report to the police on 25 March 2010 was the relevant identification although he said he had evidence of the ""original identification"" by the Complainant. The Magistrate should have so concluded. 

46After determining that the Complainant had made the identification on 25 March 2010 the learned Magistrate ought to have concluded that it was not reasonable to hold an identification parade because the Complainant had identified the Defendant and had done so at or about the time of the commission of the offence. Alternatively, and because of the latter matter, he ought to have held that it was impossible to have held an identification parade before the identification with the result that it was reasonable not to have done so. 

47The Magistrate also held that the prosecution had failed to exclude the possibility that the Complainant had incorrectly identified the person she saw as being the Defendant. That was the wrong principle to apply. Whether or not she had correctly identified him was a matter for consideration after the question of the admissibility dictated by s 114(2) was determined. 

48The Defendant was free, after the evidence had been admitted, to challenge the Complainant's identification of the Defendant. Although there had been an identification of the Defendant by the Complainant it would be open to the Defendant to assert that her identification was mistaken. The Magistrate would at that point need to have regard to the weight of the Complainant's evidence of identification to consider whether it should be accepted. That was, however, a different and later consideration from the issue of its admissibility. 
Conclusion 

49I make the following orders: 

(1) Appeal allowed. 

(2) Set aside the order of Magistrate Eckhold made 25 January 2011 at Dubbo Local Court dismissing the proceedings commenced against the Defendant for the offence of knowingly contravening a prohibition specified in an apprehended violence order. 

(3) Remit the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.

2757507,R v GOEL [2011] NSWDC 83,"Judgment 

Introduction 

1The trial of Dinker Goel began last Monday. He was arraigned on 41 counts under s135.1(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Commonwealth). Evidence was called over 3 days until, in circumstances I am about to describe, he was re-arraigned and pleaded guilty. This followed a request, from Mr Goel's counsel, Mr Morris, that I indicate how I was proposing to direct the jury as regards one aspect of the elements of each of the alleged offences. After I heard argument from Mr Morris and the Crown Prosecutor, I indicated that I would not be directing the jury in the way Mr Morris asked me to. I then adjourned for Mr Morris to get further instructions in the light of what I had just said. It was when the Court resumed that Mr Goel was re-arraigned in the presence of the jury and pleaded guilty. 

2These are the reasons for me deciding that I would not direct the jury in the way Mr Morris sought. 

Facts which are largely undisputed 

3On Sunday 19 October 2008 the accused went to the offices of CNR Accounting and Taxation Pty Ltd. There the accused met a tax consultant by the name of Sharang Sareen. He asked Mr Sareen to prepare 41 tax returns. The accused handed over 41 payment summaries (previously known as group certificates) purporting to show the income earned and tax withheld of 41 taxpayers. He also gave to Mr Sareen a document recording each of the taxpayer's bank account details. Mr Sareen did what he was asked to do, that is he prepared the tax returns and caused them to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office. 

4As it turns out the payment summaries were false. None of the tax payers actually worked for any of the three companies recorded on the various payment summaries. Accordingly they did not earn the income recorded on that summary nor was tax withheld. Further the bank account and BSB numbers were not those of the relevant taxpayers. 

5At Mr Goel's request, Mr Sareen included in each of the taxation returns claims for deductions to which the tax payer was not entitled. In fact each tax return should have had zero deductions claimed. 

6Thus the tax returns would have had the effect, if they were processed by the Australian Taxation Office, of causing refunds to be made to the 41 tax payers. Those refunds would have totalled in the order of $184,000. 

7The actions of the offender led to him being charged with 41 counts under s135.1(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Commonwealth). There was one count in relation to each tax return. The 41 counts were in a common form namely, 

""Between about 18 October 2009 and 22 October 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth, cause a tax return for the financial year ending 30 June 2008 in the name (the named tax payer) to be prepared and lodged with Australian Taxation Office, in that he procured CNR Accounting and Taxation Pty Ltd to prepare and lodge the return."" 


8The elements of that offence were set out in a document which I proposed to give to the jury in my summing up as being: 

1. The accused caused the relevant tax return to be lodged, and 

2. at the time he did this he intended to cause a loss to the Commonwealth, and 

3. he intended to cause the loss to the Commonwealth dishonestly, which means that: 


what he did was dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people, and 

he knew that what he did was dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people. 

9It is of course necessary that the relevant act of the accused coincides with the necessary mental element before the accused can be found guilty. 

The Course of the Trial 

10When the accused was arraigned last Monday he pleaded not guilty to each of the 41 counts. On the third day of the trial, the Crown began to play a number of recordings of interviews that the accused had with an investigator from the Australian Taxation Office, Mr Paul Anderson. In the course of those interviews Mr Anderson asked the accused, amongst many other matters, about how it came about that deductions were claimed for things such as work related expenses on each of the tax returns. The accused told Mr Anderson that he had asked Mr Sareen to claim ""general deductions"". When pressed by Mr Anderson to explain what he meant, the accused admitted that he should not have made that request because he had nothing to justify an assertion that such expenses had been incurred by the taxpayer. 

11As to whether the accused knew whether what he was doing was dishonest, it is important to note that the accused told Mr Anderson: 

""as far as my concern, it was wrong because even I am working as a tax, tax agent it was wrong"". 

12Later on in that same interview the accused admitted the following: 

""and I put it to you that you, you knew that there was no evidence of any deductions at all and yet you were still happy to give instructions to Sharang (Mr Sareen) to make claims for deductions that you did not know existed"". 

13After hearing this part of the interview I took the opportunity, after the jury had left for the afternoon to discuss with Mr Morris and Mr Crown whether my understanding of the elements that the Crown had to prove were correct. I was concerned because it appeared that in the interview, part of which I had just heard, it appeared that the accused was admitting to committing the offence, (even if he was not admitting that he was as dishonest as the Crown was suggesting he was). Mr Morris correctly anticipated one of the queries I had when he said, ""you're going to ask me why is this a trial?"". 

14It then became clear, after discussions with the Crown and Mr Morris, that there was a dispute between them as to how I would direct the jury. It also became clear that if I decided that I would not direct the jury in the way Mr Morris wanted me to, then it would be better for his client to learn this sooner rather than later so that he could decide how to plead. 

15The jury was therefore told not to attend until 11.00 o'clock the following day and counsel and I spent the morning resolving the issue as to how I would direct the jury. 

The correct direction to the jury. 

16It became apparent that it was the position of Mr Morris that the relevant act which the Crown must prove as being the one which caused the tax return to be lodged (and which the crown must prove was done with the necessary mental element) was the ultimate act of the accused which led to the return being lodged. Mr Morris was proposing to argue to the jury, and asked that I direct them as a matter of law, that they could not find that the accused had caused the tax return to be prepared and lodged when he finished speaking to Mr Sareen on Sunday 19 October 2008 because the taxation returns were not prepared and lodged until a couple of days after that, that occurring after the accused had received an invoice and payed it. 

17Mr Morris' position was that the time which the Crown needed to prove that the accused was dishonest (both subjective and objective dishonesty as defined in s130.3 Criminal Code ) was when the accused did the ultimate act which led to the return being lodged. His submission was that it was only the final act of the accused which caused the return to be lodged which was relevant because without that final act the tax return would not have been lodged. In effect Mr Morris suggested that I would direct the jury that there was a ""but for"" test to be applied in determining when the accused caused the tax return to be prepared and lodged. 

18Mr Morris was going to submit to the jury that because the act which caused the tax return to be lodged had to coincide with the mental element of dishonesty, whilst the accused may have been acting dishonestly on the Sunday (something he freely admitted in the interviews with Mr Anderson) he was not acting dishonestly at the time of his final act which led to the returns being lodged. (I have to say that I did not fancy the chances of Mr Morris being able to persuade the jury that it was reasonably possible that what the accused knew, and thus whether he was acting dishonestly, varied from 19 th October 2008 to when the taxation returns were lodged, but that was going to be a matter for the jury and not me). 

19The Crown's position was that I would direct the jury that they could find the accused guilty if the relevant mental state coincided with any single act which, together with other acts, led the tax return to be lodged. This would be an act which they could find caused the tax return to be lodged, and that the time at which the Crown needed to prove the mental element was when the accused did any one of those acts. 

20In the course of argument I raised the analogy, endorsed by the Crown of the situation where if a person hits another twice, and the person dies, and any one blow would not have been enough to cause the death, and the person would be guilty of murder if he or she had the necessary mental element at the time of the first blow. As a matter of law that first blow would have caused the death. 

21The Crown argument was that, at the very least, as soon as: 


Mr Sareen told the accused that he would claim ""general deductions"" at the request of the accused, 

which the accused knew should not have been claimed, 

and then agreed that the returns should be lodged with those deductions claimed in the return 


then the jury could find that he had done an act which caused a loss to the Commonwealth by causing a tax return to be lodged with the intention of acting dishonestly, that he knew was acting dishonestly, and that his intention and knowledge coincided with the act. 

22The concept of causation in the criminal law has caused difficulty from time to time. Although of course the leading case in Australia is Royall v The Queen (1990) 172 CLR 378 the Justices of the High Court in that case do not speak with one voice. As Wood CJ at CL pointed out in Moffatt v The Queen (2000) 112 ACrimR 201, 

[70]. ""The formulation of the test to be applied was not stated by their Honours in identical terms. Brennan J said that the accused's act or omission ""must contribute significantly to the death of the victim"" (at 398; 66). Deane and Dawson JJ said that it would be sufficient if the accused's conduct ""or significant cause of death"" (is a substantial at 41; 77). The ""causal connection must be sufficiently substantial to enable responsibility for the crime to be attributed to the accused"" (at 412; 78). Toohey and Gaudron JJ said the jury will inevitably concentrate its attention upon "" whether the act of the accused substantially contributed to the death"" (at 423; 86). McHugh J said that the wrongful act must be ""An operating caused and a substantial cause"" (at 444; 102). 

23However the important thing to note at this stage as far as the present case is concerned is that whichever precise formulation is adopted it would suggest that I would not direct the jury in the way in which Mr Morris asked me to. The ""but for"" test is not the test of causation in the criminal law. 

24Of course it is usually an accused who is complaining about a but/for test being used (see Arulthilakan v The Queen 204 ALR 259) because it can convey to a jury that ""a negligible causal relationship will suffice"". But I can see no good reason why the Royall test(s) should not apply even where it is the accused who seeks to limit the concept of causation to an ultimate act. 

25And lest it be thought that the common law test of causation is for some reason not applicable to offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, the Crown Prosecutor referred me to the decision of R v Petroulias (No 30) [2007] NSWSC 119 where in a prosecution under the predecessor to the section of the Criminal Code under which the present allegations are brought, Johnson J relied on the decision in Royall in determining the issue of causation in that trial. 

26I am satisfied that it would have been wrong to tell the jury that they could only look at one act of the accused in deciding whether an act of the accused which caused the tax return to be lodged coincided with the necessary mental element, and it would have been especially wrong to tell the jury that that act would have to be the ultimate act of the accused which led to the return being lodged. 

27That was not my understanding of the concept of causation as it applied in the trial. I was of the view that the jury were entitled to look at any one act which, together with other acts, led the tax return to be lodged and determine whether that that act caused (in the Royall sense) the tax return to be lodged and if that act coincided with a finding that the accused had the necessary mental element at that time then all the elements of the offence would have been proved by the Crown. 

28Mr Morris also had some submissions regarding the precise terms of the indictment. Indeed he said that if each count in the indictment made no reference to the return being ""lodged"" but only referred to the return being ""prepared"" then his client would have no defence. Notwithstanding the obvious attraction to the Crown in having the accused plead guilty to an indictment amended in that way, (namely the absence of a judgment which could be the subject of appeal) the Crown did not make any application to amend the indictment. 

29It has to be remembered that the offence is complete as soon as a person does an act with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from a Commonwealth entity. Quite clearly in his interviews the accused was admitting that he had done that when he spoke to Mr Sareen on Sunday 18 th October 2008. Of course the accused comes to court to meet a particular allegation as specified in an indictment. But that does not mean that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt everything in the indictment and due recognition must be paid to the difference between what the Crown must prove and what are mere particulars. Much of the allegation contained in the indictment consists of particulars. For example the words ""in that he procured CNR Accounting and Taxation Pty Ltd to prepare and lodge the return"" are particulars, not elements, so I did not find that the particular way the counts were drafted supported Mr Morris' submission as to the way I should direct the jury. 

30Those are the reasons for me indicating to Mr Morris that I would not direct the jury in the manner he asked me to. 

31The task of deciding the factual basis on which I must sentence Mr Goel now begins. It will be for me to decide whether his dishonesty extends to knowledge that the tax returns were based on income which was not earned and tax which was not withheld or whether his dishonesty is instead, as Mr Morris suggests, limited to procuring the lodging of tax returns with claims for deductions which should not have been made. Even if I do not find in favour of the Crown on that issue a second issue remains concerning whether the offender's dishonesty extended to knowledge of the extent of the deductions actually claimed or whether it was limited to him believing that some lesser amount would be claimed by Mr Sareen.

		05 August 2011",2011-08-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757524,R v Crowe [2011] NSWCCA 251,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of armed robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 20 years. 

2The sentencing judge sentenced the respondent to a 12 month bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed that sentence pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

3On 5 August 2011 the court made orders that the appeal be dismissed. These are my reasons for joining in that order. 

The facts 

4The primary judge's sentencing remarks are brief and he makes no findings of fact. However, the relevant facts have been summarised in the Crown's submission. 

5On the evening of 11 June 2010, the respondent met up with a co-offender, Nicholas Antunovich, at the respondent's father's home at Leumeah. The respondent consumed four bottles of beer and left with Antunovich to pick up three other co-offenders, DT, MP and Daniel Case. The group were driven by Antunovich to an address in Ingleburn and Antunovich left the vehicle, returning openly holding a replica handgun which he placed in a compartment in the dashboard. 

6The group decided to go to Kings Cross and the respondent sat in the front passenger seat while Antunovich drove. On the way, the respondent consumed a further three to four bottles of beer. 

7At about 1 am on 12 June 2010 Antunovich stopped the vehicle in Woolloomooloo near the victim who had been walking home after dinner and drinks in Darlinghurst. The respondent exited the front passenger side of the vehicle in possession of the black replica handgun. The firearm was being held in his right hand in a vertical position and pointed directly at the victim. The victim felt immediate fear upon seeing the firearm. The respondent demanded the victim's wallet and the victim replied that he did not have one. The respondent demanded the victim's mobile phone and the victim replied that he did not have one. The respondent then said ""I need money"" and the victim replied ""I don't have much"", before removing a $5 note from his pocket and throwing it to the ground. The victim lifted his arms up in a pacifying fashion before backing away slowly from the respondent and the vehicle. 

8The co-offender, MP, picked up the $5 note, and the respondent and MP both got back into the vehicle and drove away. It was decided by the group that MP should have the money as he had earlier paid for a pair of pliers to fix the vehicle. The victim called police and the respondent and his four co-offenders were apprehended at 1.30 am on 12 June 2010 in Potts Point. 

9Antunovich was identified as the owner of the vehicle and he was present whilst the police searched the vehicle. During the search a black replica firearm, a black flick knife and a large kitchen knife were located within the stereo compartment of the dashboard. 

10The respondent participated in an electronically recorded interview during the course of which he admitted to being in the vehicle, having possession of the firearm and pointing it at the victim. 

Subjective circumstances 

11The respondent gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. Two psychiatric reports from Mr Ted Cassidy and Ms M Schweikle were tendered as were a number of testimonials favourable to the respondent. 

12The respondent was born in 1992 and had just turned 18 at the time of the commission of the offence. He is the only child of an Australian born father and a Fijian mother. The respondent said that his parents separated shortly after his birth but continued to reside together until 2005. The respondent said that he had been raised primarily by his father and at the time of sentencing his mother was residing in Fiji. The respondent by this time was living with a family friend. 

13The respondent left school after completing Year 10. At the time he was sentenced he had obtained part time employment at McDonalds where he has worked since leaving school. He was also attending a pre-apprenticeship course at TAFE in automotive vehicle body work. 

14The respondent reported to Dr Cassidy that on the day of the offence he was distressed because a relationship of two years duration had just ended. The Probation and Parole officer Alison Lowe reported that the respondent said to her that ""he could not account for his behaviour, although stated it was 'maybe to forget' the recent breakdown in his relationship with his girlfriend."" 

15The respondent reported to Dr Cassidy that he had had 12 drinks and was intoxicated by the time he met his co-offenders. The statement of agreed facts indicated that he had consumed 4 bottles of Toohey's Extra Dry Beer whilst at his father's house between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm on 11 June 2010 and a further 3-4 bottles of Toohey's Extra Dry before 1 pm on 12 June 2010 when the robbery occurred. 

16The respondent reported to Dr Cassidy a pattern of ""binge"" drinking two to three times a month when he consumed between 4 to 6 standard drinks. He told the Probation and Parole officer that he had ""a minimal history with alcohol."" 

17Since the date of the offence the respondent reported that he had largely abstained from alcohol. Ms Lowe said that he ""maintained that he has not consumed alcohol to the point of excess since the commission of the offence."" 

18The respondent reported depressive symptoms as well as stress arising from the court proceedings. He has been prescribed anti-depressant medication by Dr Cassidy and has been undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy with the psychologist, Ms Schweikle. 

Co-offenders 

19This Court was informed that the sentencing proceedings in relation to the co-offenders, Antunovich and Case have been adjourned pending the resolution of this appeal. Two of the co-offenders have been dealt with in the Children's Court. 

20The Director advanced four grounds of appeal. 

Ground 1: His Honour erred in failing to give proper reasons. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offending behaviour. 

Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to have any regard to the purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act and in particular his Honour failed to have regard to the principle of general deterrence. 

Ground 4: His Honour erred in imposing a sentence that is manifestly inadequate. 

21It is unnecessary to resolve ground one of the appeal. However, as I have already indicated his Honour's remarks on sentence were brief, failed to indicate relevant findings of fact and contained little guidance as to how his Honour had concluded that the guideline judgment in Henry was inappropriate. 

22Ground two raised his Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the respondent's behaviour. His Honour said: 

""This case would have to be rated as one of the most minor cases that has come before me of an alleged robbery."" 

23This Court is not aware of the range of cases which may have come before his Honour. However, if by this remark, his Honour intended to indicate that this was a case at the ""most minor"" end of the scale of objective gravity of offending behaviour involving armed robbery I cannot share his conclusion. The offence occurred at about 1 am when the victim was making his way home on foot in the public street. He was accosted by the respondent who plainly had others in support and was challenged with a gun. The victim would not have known that the gun was a replica and given the hour of the night must have been put in considerable fear. His Honour said that the offence was minor because amongst other reasons no violence was offered. 

24Although the sentencing judge acknowledged that a replica pistol was produced he appears to have downplayed its significance. His Honour said of the gun: 

""This induced the person to believe perhaps it was real and he gave them five dollars."" 

25In making this finding his Honour appears to have ignored the statement of agreed facts. The statement makes plain that the respondent exited the vehicle holding the gun in his right hand and pointed it directly at the victim. The statement records, and this would come as no surprise, that the victim felt immediate fear upon seeing the firearm. The respondent then demanded the victim's wallet and mobile phone. He was ultimately given five dollars which the victim threw on the ground. 

26Although when sentencing his Honour was obliged to have regard to the fact that the proffered gun was a replica he nevertheless was required to sentence recognising that it was the crime of armed robbery which had been committed. This issue was discussed in R v Majstrovic [2000] NSWCCA 420 where Hulme J said: 

""In light of the material which was before his Honour and this Court, the matter should have been, and must be, approached upon the basis that the weapon used by the applicant in the robbery was a toy. It thus imposed no physical risk to his victim or victims, or members of the public. In this respect the applicant's offence was less serious than those where a weapon such as a loaded gun, or a knife, is used, and the applicant was fairly entitled to have this difference taken into account. 

On the other hand, it must still be recognised that the applicant's use of the weapon was no doubt designed to strike fear in his victim or victims and, given that they apparently complied with his demands, did so. Although there was no evidence before the court of their subsequent reaction to this fear, it must be recognised that not all members of the public readily recover from such traumatic incidents."" 

27It is apparent from his Honour's remarks that the sentencing judge was mindful of the judgment of this Court in Henry but considered it to be irrelevant to the respondent's circumstances saying that ""when one looks at it carefully (it is dealing with) robberies of service stations, all night grocery stores, corner shops, chemists shops and places like that."" I do not believe his Honour is correct. 

28The offender contemplated by Spigelman CJ in Henry at [162] was described by his Honour as ""a young offender with little or no criminal history with a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury."" His Honour identified the relevant offence as having a limited degree of planning and limited if any actual violence but a real threat of violence. The Chief Justice said that he had in mind a victim in a vulnerable position, his Honour giving the illustration of a shopkeeper or taxi driver. The offence which the Chief Justice contemplated involved a small amount being taken together with a plea of guilty. 

29To my mind many of the characteristics identified in Henry were present in the present case. The respondent is young with no criminal history. A weapon, albeit a replica was used and there was a limited degree of planning. There was no actual violence although the threat was real. The event must have been stressful if not traumatic for the victim. There was a small amount taken and the respondent pleaded guilty. Although the Chief Justice referred to a person in a vulnerable position identifying a shopkeeper or taxi driver it seems to me a person walking alone on a public street in the early hours of the morning is equally if not more vulnerable. They are isolated without any separation from their assailant and without recourse to any alarm or other security or protective facility. A person who is confronted at gun point is in many ways more vulnerable than someone challenged by an offender holding a knife. Any attempt to escape from the thief with a gun may be met by the discharge of the weapon. 

30Spigelman CJ was of the opinion that the sentence for the offence and offender which he characterised should generally fall between 4 and 5 years imprisonment for the full term. However, the Chief Justice recognised that the individual circumstances of the offender and his or her crime must be the ultimate determining factor in the sentence which is imposed. His Honour said that in relation to the offence of armed robbery a number of circumstances are of particular relevance being the nature of the weapon used, the vulnerability of the victim, position on the scale of impulsiveness/planning, intensity of threat, or actual use of force, number of offenders, amount taken and the effect on the victim. 

31In the present case the sentencing judge recognised that the respondent was just over the age of 18 at the time of the offence. He was travelling with a group of juveniles in a car in which there was a replica black pistol. It was not the offender's. It is clear that the respondent had consumed large amounts of alcohol and was probably significantly intoxicated at the time of the offence. His Honour identified the fact that the respondent had had a troubled upbringing but had good references from people he had worked with. 

32It would seem that his Honour was significantly influenced by the fact that the amount of money taken was very small and no violence was offered beyond the presentation of the replica pistol. His Honour said that in his opinion ""the circumstances of the case are well below those that call for sentences of imprisonment and I declined to impose one."" It would seem that his Honour recognised that the view which he had come to may not be accepted by this Court saying: ""if the court of Criminal appeal wants to impose one, they can impose one but I am not going to."" 

33His Honour concluded that ""when someone is young, foolish and addicted to alcohol and commits a single error on a night impulsively he does not deserve to go to gaol and I decline to send him there."" If his Honour meant this as a general response irrespective of the crime committed and the circumstances of its commission it could not be accepted. For example, if violence had actually been inflicted as opposed to merely threatened the circumstances of this offence would have taken on a quite different character. 

34One of the characteristics of a civilised society is the capacity of citizens to walk the streets without concern that they may be put in fear of their lives and robbed. Although the real risk to the victim is obviously much greater when the weapon is itself real and loaded a victim is not to know this when a replica or unloaded gun is presented. The judgments in Henry accepted that this type of crime was of increasing prevalence in the community making a consideration of general deterrence of greater significance than it may be for some other types of crime. 

35In my opinion the circumstances of this offence required a more significant penalty than a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. At the hearing before the sentencing judge the prospect of a sentence of imprisonment which was to be suspended was discussed. His Honour rejected this possibility saying that ""this does not warrant imprisonment therefore s 12 does not come into the question."" 

36The sentencing judge determined that any form of prison sentence was inappropriate, the respondent being young, foolish and addicted to alcohol. I accept that he is young and foolish and acted at the urging of his companions. However, he committed a serious crime for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty years. The sentencing judge was required to impose a penalty which was sufficient to ensure that the respondent was suitably punished and ensured that others like him appreciate that this type of offence will not be tolerated in the community. To my mind a Section 9 bond was quite inadequate to achieve these objectives. The respondent should at the least have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months but suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

37The respondent drew attention to the sentence which, since he was sentenced, has been imposed upon a co-offender who was aged 16 years and 8 months at the time of committing the offence. The young person was released on probation for 18 months under s 33(1)(e) of the Children (Criminal Procedure) Act with conditions. 

38To my mind the age difference between that young person and the respondent is of some significance. Furthermore, although it was at his companion's urging, it was the respondent who produced the replica weapon and effected the robbery. The sentence I would impose would not be disproportionate to the sentence imposed on the young person. 

39Although I am of the opinion that a suspended sentence should have been imposed by the sentencing judge I recognise that my colleagues have a different view. 

40Evidence tendered to this Court indicates that the respondent has recently completed the first year of his pre-apprenticeship in a vehicle painting course at Campbelltown TAFE. The course was completed on 24 June 2011. Although the respondent has gained some employment in that industry he has not yet been able to secure full time employment. In the meantime he has continued working with McDonalds where he works 4 or 5 days a week. He is actively seeking work in a spray painting business. 

41Evidence was also given of the treatment which the respondent has received for his depression. He also gave evidence that he has abstained from taking alcohol in recent months and has participated in a program of treatment from Dr Cassidy a consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Cassidy has structured a program which requires the respondent to have his position reviewed on a 4 to 6 week basis. 

42These matters persuade me that the respondent has recognised the seriousness of his offending and has taken steps to put his life in order. Although the sentence I would have imposed would not have required his incarceration, unless he transgressed further, in the circumstances I am satisfied that in the exercise of its discretion this Court should not intervene ( R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [98]). He deserves the opportunity to continue on the path which he appears to have set for himself. 

43For these reasons I joined in dismissing the appeal. 

44SIMPSON J: I joined in the orders made on 5 August 2011. Since McClellan CJ at CL has indicated that he favoured a more severe penalty than that imposed, but that the other members of the Court did not, it is appropriate that I express briefly my reasons for concluding that the Crown appeal ought to be dismissed. 

45It is unnecessary to restate the facts of the offence. It was obviously serious. Nor is it necessary to review the deficiencies in the Remarks on Sentence. 

46Notwithstanding those deficiencies, I concluded that the Crown appeal ought to be dismissed. That is for a number of reasons, as follows: 

(1) although the respondent was an adult at the time of the offence, he was barely so - by just one month. He was 18 years and 1 month old. Had he committed the offence one month earlier, he would have been dealt with in a Children's Court under the special provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. His co-offenders were sentenced in that jurisdiction. It is scarcely conceivable that, in that jurisdiction, for a first offence, he would have been sentenced to any form of imprisonment, certainly not in an adult facility. 

Of course, the law must provide for cut-off points, and 18 years is the age at which the law decrees that offenders lose the benefit of the special protective jurisdiction. But that does not meant that those protections are to be put aside as entirely irrelevant. 

Moreover, the respondent had no previous criminal history, and had not experienced the Children's Court, where he would undoubtedly have been warned, as he approached 18 years of age, that he faced the rigours of the adult sentencing process. This was his first experience of the criminal law; 

(2) the offence was impulsive, entirely unpremeditated, and undertaken by the respondent at the behest and instigation of his younger co-offenders; 

(3) there was strong evidence of rehabilitation. In a psychiatric report, Dr Cassidy said that the respondent had commenced a course of psychiatric treatment, to which he had made an excellent response. He had (at the time of the report) ceased alcohol use. By the time the respondent gave evidence, he said that he had decreased his alcohol use and, at that time (April 2011) he had not had a drink since Christmas. He has commenced a pre-apprenticeship course at TAFE and has attended every day. He has also taken employment on a part-time basis. 

47For these reasons, I consider that this was an exceptional case that did not, notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence, call for a sentence of full-time imprisonment, even if suspended. 

48FULLERTON J: I was also of the opinion that the Crown appeal should be dismissed and joined in the orders made on 5 August 2011. I am also of the opinion that despite the seriousness of the offending a sentence of imprisonment (even if suspended) was not warranted in the particular circumstances of this case. In addition to the matters Simpson J has identified as persuading her to that conclusion, I would add that s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act mandates that imprisonment is a sanction of last resort, and that the sentencing court makes a positive finding that no other penalty than imprisonment is appropriate if a sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed. This is consistent with a related and basic principle of sentencing law that a sentence of imprisonment not exceed what is appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime ( Hoare v R [1989] HCA 33; 167 CLR 348 at 354). 

49In his relatively brief sentencing remarks the sentencing judge made express reference to the fact that the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act stipulates that imprisonment is a sentence of last resort. He considered that supervision under a 2 year s 9 bond was, in effect, an alternative to imprisonment he could not exclude as an appropriate sentence for a young man who was encountering the criminal law for the first time and who, subject to peer pressure and the effects of alcohol, had acted foolishly and impulsively. 

50While I accept that this case has some of the features of the offender the subject of the guideline judgment in Henry , and for that reason the sentencing judge had no legitimate basis for considering it as irrelevant to the sentencing exercise, I do not consider that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried.

2757526,Police v Kathy May MILLER [2011] NSWLC 21,"JUDGMENT 

Remarks on sentence 

1The offender appears for sentence in respect of one count of Supply Prohibited Drug contrary to section 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, one count of Possess Prohibited Drug contrary to section 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and one count of Possess ammunition for Firearm without being authorised by Licence or Permit contrary to section 65(3) of the Firearms Act 1996. A plea of guilty was entered to the Possess Prohibited Drug charge at the earliest opportunity on 26 October 2010 when the matter first came before the Court. Pleas of Not Guilty were entered in respect of the other two matters. The usual brief service orders were made and on 3 February 2011 the offender pleaded guilty to the two remaining matters. I assess the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea for the charges of Supply Prohibited Drug and Possess Ammunition to be 20%. The offender is entitled to the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea for the Possess Prohibited Drug Charge. 

Facts 

2As is customary in the Local Court the matter proceeded by way of tender of a Police Fact Sheet. As there was no apparent objection taken at the time or on the date on which submissions on sentence were received I proceed on the basis that the contents of the Fact Sheet are agreed facts. Those facts of course, remain with the court papers. 

3Police sought and obtained a search warrant in respect of the offender's premises in Albury. Police attended those premises at about 9.30am on 6 October 2010 to execute that warrant. This offender was one of the persons at the premises. The offender said to police words to the effect of, ""You have got me a beauty. I'm trying to make a living that's all. I'm trying to do my secretly private stuff and the boys have brought me undone now, unless you turn a blind eye to it"". 

4A co-offender Kate Mildren was also at the premises. She made admissions to the police and she too was charged with Supply Prohibited Drug. I shall return to this issue later when I consider the issue of parity. 

5A search of the front bedroom of the premises police located various articles, documents and medications in the name of the offender. The accused maintained that the co offender occupied that room. A further search of the front bedroom police located a grey coloured esky portable cooler situated on the floor next to the bed. Upon opening the cooler seven medium size resealable bags were located each with a number of individually packaged articles wrapped in aluminium foil. A further five medium size resealable bags were located each containing an amount of cannabis. The co offender admitted to ownership of this amount of cannabis but this offender placed her hand over Mildren's mouth and said, ""It's mine, it's mine"". 

6Police also seized a bong from the bedroom and a small notebook that contained entries: ""gram=1.0 on scale, fifty=3.0, Q=7.0, +14.0, Oz=28, 10=0.5"". Within a drawer in the bedroom resealable bags, a roll of aluminium foil and a set of digital scales were found. Within the same drawer as the foil and bags police located a tin money can with a resealable bag containing an amount of cannabis. 

7Police also located three live rounds of ammunition of various calibres. No firearm was apparently located. 

8A total of twelve resealable bags containing cannabis removed from the cooler weighed a total of 408.5 grams. This weight would have included the packaging. The resealable bag within the money can weighed 17.1 grams and this too would have included the packaging. 

9The offender made admissions as to possession of the money can and the 17.1 grams of cannabis found therein, which she told police was for personal use. She denied being involved in the supply. 

10For the purpose of proceeding to sentence I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the supply of cannabis from the premises was a joint criminal enterprise being undertaken by the offender and the co-offender Mildren. 

Assessment of the criminality 

11The total amount of cannabis recovered from the premises was 425.6 grams, not a great deal less than the imperial pound measurement (454 grams). Clearly it was a commercial venture. However, it was not particularly sophisticated, and the supply was a relatively low level supply. The matter is below the mid point on the scale of objective seriousness for matters of this sort. 

Maximum Penalty 

12The maximum penalty for the Supply Prohibited Drug (Cannabis) is 10 years imprisonment on indictment, and the jurisdictional limit in the Local Court is a penalty of 2 years imprisonment. The charge of Supply Prohibited Drug (Cannabis) is one to which the principles enunciated in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 apply. In that decision Grove J. (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J. agreeing) in that decision said at [35]: 

The result of true construction of the statutory provisions in New South Wales is that, what has been prescribed is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. In other words, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The implication of the argument of the appellant that, in lieu of prescribed maximum penalties exceeding two years imprisonment, a maximum of two years imprisonment for all offences triable summarily in the Local Court has been substituted must be rejected. As must also be rejected the corollary that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be reserved for a 'worst case'. 

13By virtue of the operation of s 21 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 the maximum penalty for the Possession charge is one of 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 20 penalty unity ($2,200). The maximum penalty for the offence of Possession of the Ammunition contrary to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act 1996 is a fine of 50 penalty units ($5,500). 

Offender's Criminal History 

14The offender is not assisted by her criminal history. Indeed, at the time of the commission of these offences the offender was subject to parole for the offence of Attempt Murder. On 13 May 2008 at the District Court at Albury the offender was sentenced to a total sentence of 4 years and 1 month with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months. The parole period expires on 27 August 2011. 

15Despite being towards the end of the parole period, these offences nevertheless were committed while the offender was on parole. In R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289 Harrison J (Beazley JA, Hislop J agreeing) said at [41] that: 

His Honour found that the fact that the offences were committed whilst the respondent was on parole or in gaol were circumstances of aggravation. He said, ""The genesis of some of these offences was whilst he was in custody"" and refers to the respondent being granted work release from July 2004. It is uncontroversial that the commission of an offence by an offender who is on conditional liberty is a matter of aggravation that is relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence. 

16I am satisfied however, that the commission of further offences while subject to an order of conditional liberty is the only aggravating factor present in this matter. 

17The criminal history is otherwise unremarkable with relatively minor driving and resist police type matters. 

Matters of General Principle 

18The decided cases from the Court of Criminal Appeal need to be applied carefully as they are decisions following sentences imposed by the District Court on Indictment. It follows that such matters involve much higher quantities of prohibited drugs than is the case in matters of this type that routinely come before the Local Court. This is one area where the JIRS statistics might be useful. I shall return to the statistics later in these remarks. It appears from the authorities in the Court of Criminal Appeal that if an offender is ""substantially involved in drug trafficking"" a sentence of full time custody is appropriate unless there are exceptional circumstances. This was o ne of the issues that arose for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Michael v R [2011] NSWCCA 122. Garling J (Macfarlan JA, Johnson J agreeing) reviewed a considerable number of authorities and said at [42]-[47]: 

It was clear that the applicant had never previously been convicted of supplying a prohibited drug. It was submitted by the applicant that the amounts involved in this case were modest and there was a real question as to whether he could have been said to have been involved in drug trafficking "" ... to a substantial degree "". 

43 This submission was based upon a consistent line of authority in this Court that where an offender has been "" substantially involved in the supply of a prohibited drug "", unless there are truly exceptional circumstances, a fulltime custodial sentence ought to be imposed: see R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 per Howie J (Grove and Simpson JJ agreeing); Scott v R [2010] NSWCCA 103 at [27]-[29] per Hislop J (Allsop P and Grove J agreeing). 

44 In R v Ozer, unreported, NSWCCA (9 November 1993), Hunt CJ at CL held that where an offence was a limited and isolated event, the offender was not trafficking in the sense in which he had used that expression. 

45 In R v Gip (2006) 161 A Crim R 173, when considering this line of authority McClellan CJ at CL discussed two unreported decisions of this Court, namely R v Clark, unreported, NSWCCA (15 March 1990) and R v Bardo , unreported, NSWCCA (14 July 1992). These were the decisions to which Hunt CJ at CL had referred in Ozer . McClellan CJ at CL said at [13] this: 

""My understanding of these various statements is that where a finding can be made that an offender has engaged in repeated offences so that his or her activities can be described as trafficking, a full time custodial sentence should, unless there are exceptional circumstances, be imposed. However, if only one offence can be proved, but the circumstances surrounding that offence indicate that it was the result of a sophisticated commercial arrangement, the objective criminality involved may also require a custodial sentence, unless exceptional circumstances can otherwise be shown."" 

46 Rothman J in Gip cautioned that the views expressed in Clark and Bardo ought not be regarded as if they were a legislative enactment. He said that the proper approach for a sentencing judge was to concentrate on the substance of what was revealed by the facts in each case. At [43]-[44] he said: 

""43. The ultimate question is whether the accused is involved, in the ordinary sense, in trafficking. The mere fact that a person has been caught on only one occasion does not mean the person is not involved in trafficking. The question for the sentencing judge is whether there are facts, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, which facts give rise to an exercise of discretion consistent with the approach in Clark . Those facts may be an agreement to supply on another occasion, and attempt to supply on another occasion, participation in a process which envisages supply on more than one occasion, participation in a syndicate, or a number of other circumstances. 

44. The ultimate question must be whether, on the application of ordinary principles of sentencing, full-time custody is warranted. In any situation where the person has been shown to have been involved (directly or indirectly) in an ongoing arrangement, or intended ongoing arrangement, for the supply of drugs, that person, for the purpose of the sentencing principle, should be taken to have been involved in trafficking. The isolated, one off incident of supply, ... does not include persons who, although charged with one offence, are otherwise shown to have an involvement in a process which contemplates supply on more than one occasion. That could be shown, as already stated, by proving any one of a range of activities which give rise to the inference of past, present or future involvement in trafficking."" 

47 I respectfully agree with the statement of Rothman J as to the proper approach by a sentencing judge, in the circumstances of a case such as this. 

19After earnest consideration of the authorities I find myself unable to conclude that the offender was ""substantially involved in drug trafficking"". As I found in determining the criminality it was a ""low level"" venture and the quantities of the drug found were not particularly high, but nevertheless the quantity found was more than sufficient for a number of transactions, particularly given the scales and notations found in the notebook. A finding that the offender was not ""substantially involved in drug trafficking"" does not automatically mean that a full time custodial sentence should not be imposed. 

Parity 

20The co offender was sentenced to a lengthy supervised bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, the co offender had spent a number of weeks in custody following numerous breaches of bail. Further, she was much younger than this offender and her criminal history was less significant. I am satisfied that parity does not loom large in this sentencing exercise. 

JIRS statistics 

21Mr Hoyles on behalf of the offender tendered the JIRS statistics. Of a sample of 1005 cases, 23% received sentences of full time custody, and a further 30% received a suspended sentence, periodic detention or home detention. Therefore in slightly more than 50% of cases a determination has been made that no other sentence other than custody was appropriate - see R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [24]-[25]. The statistics are quite useful given the significant sample, and what I have said earlier about the need for care so far as applying the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in these types of matters is concerned. 

22However, it is appropriate that I caution myself about the use of those statistics - see for e.g. Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45, R v Ryan (2003) 141 A Crim R 403 at 411, and Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 at [2]-[3]. 

Mental Condition of the Offender 

23I have a number of documents to consider. Initially, there is a Pre Sentence Report prepared by the local office of the Probation and Parole Service. There is also a report under the hand of Di Griffin (Alcohol and Other Drugs Counsellor with the Albury/Wodonga Aboriginal Health Service), Report from Dr Gordon Taylor of the Albury/Wodonga Aboriginal Health Service, a Report from Dr Youseff also of the Albury/Wodonga Aboriginal Health Service, a document entitled ""Selective History Report for Miller, Miss Kathy printed 26/7/2011, and a Report prepared by Dr Bruce Westmore, Forensic Psychiatrist dated 28 February 2008. 

24The Report from Dr Westmore is a medico-legal report, presumably prepared for use in the sentence proceedings in the District Court for the Attempt Murder. That report narrates the circumstances of that offence as given by the offender. It then goes on to say that the offender has ""no psychiatric history"". The report notes that the offender (at the time of the preparation of that report) used cannabis occasionally and she has never been a heavy drinker. The report also sets out the appalling life the offender has had. I shall return to this issue later in these remarks. Dr Westmore opined that ""she has no past formal psychiatric history but it is likely this woman has suffered chronic depression over many years due to multiple social and psychological problems. Dr Westmore formed the opinion that at the time he saw her the offender was depressed and recommended a course of anti-depressants. 

25Given the basis for the finding by Dr Westmore that the offender was depressed (i.e. the past multiple social and psychological functions) I am satisfied that it is highly likely that the offender still suffers from that depression. I am fortified in that finding by the content of the reports of Drs Youseff and Taylor, and the ""Selective History Report"". I note that Dr Taylor also notes in his report that the offender engaged the Albury/Wodonga Aboriginal Health Service for ""her depressive illness and substance abuse"". It would seem therefore noting the contents of Dr Westmore's Report that the substance abuse issues are of relatively recent origin. Dr Taylor was unable to comment about the connection between the mental condition of the offender and the commission of these offences. 

26Mr Hoyles submitted that the mental condition of the offender was such that general deterrence played a much lesser part in this sentencing exercise. On this issue Johnson J in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302 said at [109]-[110]: 

Mental illness may render an offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and thereby moderate that consideration: R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at 86; R v Engert at 71; R v Israil at paragraph 22; R v Hemsley at paragraph 34. Whether this principle applies, of course, depends upon the circumstances of the case. A finding of mental illness does not lead to an automatic reduction in the weight to be given to general deterrence in the particular case. 

110 In R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48, Hunt CJ at CL (Gleeson CJ and Hidden J agreeing) at 51, elaborated upon the rationale for this principle and a number of other factors which are relevant to the present appeal: 

""The reason for the principle is that the interests of society do not require such persons to be punished as severely as persons without that disability because such severity is inappropriate to their circumstances. The full understanding of the authority and requirements of the law which is attributed to the ordinary individual of adult intellectual capacities cannot be expected of a person whose intellectual function is insufficient to have that understanding. The means by which the courts give effect to that principle (as an instrument of social administration) is to moderate the consideration of general deterrence to the circumstances of the particular case. But, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great. The evidence that the respondent did not act with knowledge of what he was doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions is difficult, if not impossible, to find. The medical evidence before the judge was that the respondent suffered from a psychiatric illness with features of schizophrenia, which he was able to keep under control with medication prescribed for him but which flared up either when he failed to take the medication or when he abused drugs. This condition causes auditory hallucinations, when he hears a small man with a beard talking to another voice, who tells him what to do and who punishes him if he does not do it. The respondent was a user of both marijuana and amphetamines, and had been for many years. On the night in question, he had not been taking his medication for three days - having left his parents' home where he lived after a dispute - and he was intoxicated with both marijuana and amphetamines. These had led to a psychotic state at the time. The respondent told a psychiatrist that on that night the second voice had told him that it was a good idea to rob the person who delivered the pizza."" 

27Grove AJ in giving the leading judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Hardcastle v R [2011] NSWCCA 87 also reviewed a number of the authorities on the subject and said at [26]: 

26 A useful collation of principle and authority has been provided by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194: 

""[177] Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] - [48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] - [51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] - [45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner: 

Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. 
It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 - 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28]. 
It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25 ]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28]. 
It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192]. 
Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24]. 

[178] I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence: R v Skura [2004] VSCA 53; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102; (2007) 16 VR 269 at [5].""

28While I readily accept that the offender is suffering from a depressive illness on the material before me I cannot be satisfied that that mental condition has ""contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way"". The operation of which the offender was part required some planning (although not of a substantial nature) in the acquiring of the product, the packing, and the marketing of the cannabis. 

29It is apparent that the issue of mental illness and mental condition is a factor that routinely arises in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and indeed in all the criminal courts. It is certainly an issue that within my experience regularly arises in the Local Court. It is appropriate to acknowledge what RS Hulme J said in Field v R [2011] NSWCCA 70 at [26]: 

No one can sit in this court for very long without also being conscious of how often offenders, who are said to suffer from some mental condition arguing for a lesser sentence seem, despite that condition, to be able to plan and execute with reasonably efficiency offences of dishonesty. 

30With unfeigned respect to his Honour, it seems to me that the same can be said of offences of supplying a prohibited drug. In all of the circumstances, and after thorough consideration of all the reports, I am of the opinion that while the mental condition of the offender is relevant as a mitigating factor, I am not persuaded that the mental condition of the offender is such that the issue of general deterrence must be the secondary consideration as was urged upon me by counsel for the appellant. 

Other subjective considerations 

31Perhaps the most important subjective factor relates to the truly appalling life the offender had in her formative years. The report from Ms Griffin is particularly helpful in this regard, but the issue is also raised in the Pre-Sentence Report. The offender was removed from her natural mother soon after birth and her childhood was marked by constant physical, sexual and emotional abuse. She fled the abusive environment and had her first child at the age of 16. That child was removed from her. Clearly, the Fernando factors are present in this matter. On this issue, however, there is the more recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kennedy v R [2010] NSWCCA 260. In that decision Simpson J (Fullerton & RA Hulme JJ agreeing) said at [53]: 

Properly understood, Fernando is a decision, not about sentencing Aboriginals, but about the recognition, in sentencing decisions, of social disadvantage that frequently (no matter what the ethnicity of the offender) precedes the commission of crime. Particularly relevant, in the circumstances of that case (and this) is the impact of alcohol addiction or dependence. In the proposition lettered (E), Wood J said: 
""(E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects."" 
It is this proposition that senior counsel for the applicant argued was here applicable, but was rejected by the sentencing judge. 

32I am clearly of the opinion that the offender suffered to a very significant extent the ""social disadvantage"" of which the various authorities speak. 

33The Pre-Sentence Report also notes that the offender is on parole, and notes further that the Parole Board is awaiting the outcome of these proceedings. The Report also notes that the offender told the author of the report that she was aware that she had placed herself in jeopardy of being returned to custody. She apparently told the author of the Report that she was pleased that she was caught as being apprehended has caused her to take stock of her drug use and to stop using. On this issue the Report (dated 7 March 2011) notes that urinalysis indicates that the offender has in fact stopped using cannabis. 

34The offender is a 47-year-old lady of aboriginal descent. She is one of 7 children, and she has had 7 children herself. A great deal of the submissions put on behalf of the offender related to her mental health. I have already covered that issue at some length. It was put on behalf of the offender that she has already made ""extraordinary efforts"" at rehabilitation. While I accept that the offender has made some steps at rehabilitation, I find myself quite unable to agree with the proposition that those steps are extraordinary. To use an expression of Schmidt J in passing sentence in the matter of R v Williams [2011] NSWSC 583, ""that the offender is unlikely to re offend, is in my view a conclusion that cannot readily be reached"". She was prepared to become involved in the supply of cannabis while on parole for a very serious offence. 

35Mr Hoyles also addressed on the statistics to which I have earlier referred. It was put that I would find that no other sentence other than custody was appropriate, but because of the subjective matters and the issue of rehabilitation that I would suspend any sentence. However, it is timely to remind myself of what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354: 

Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective seriousness of the case: Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. 

36I accept that there are very persuasive subjective factors present in this matter. 

Prosecution's submissions 

37The prosecution argued that only a sentence of full time custody was appropriate in this matter. The aggravating factor of further offending while on parole was emphasised. It was put that the offender was dealing in cannabis from her home, and the dealing was not ""minimalist"" in nature. I have already made findings on this issue. 

General Remarks 

38However, the issues of general deterrence and retribution are also to be considered. I must, offcourse, give proper effect to sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The purposes of punishment as prescribed in s 3A are: 

(a)to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b)to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c)to protect the community from the offender, 
(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e)to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f)to denounce the conduct of the offender, and 
(g)to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 

39It has been made clear from the authorities, but particularly Zamagias the initial consideration is whether any other form of punishment other than custody is appropriate. Given the criminality involved taken with further offending while on parole, I am firmly of the opinion that no other sentence other than custody is warranted. The next issue is the length of the sentence. I am of the opinion that taking into account the criminality, the aggravating feature and the mitigating factors I am of the opinion that the appropriate starting point is in the vicinity of 15 months. That is to be discounted by 20%, which leads to a total sentence of 12 months imprisonment. 

40I now turn to the issue of how the sentence is to be served. Home detention is not available in Albury, nor is an Intensive Correction Order. On the issue of suspending the sentence i n R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 Howie J said (paragraph [32]): 

Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is to protect the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. 

41Given the criminality, the fact of the commission of the offence while on parole and the need for general deterrence, I am of the opinion that the sentence should not be suspended. However, given the very strong subjective case I am nevertheless satisfied that ""special circumstances"" are present, and that there should be a very substantial variation of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and balance of term. 

Formal Orders 

42In respect of each charge the offender is convicted. 

43On the charge of Supply Prohibited Drug (Cannabis), the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 months to commence 5 August 2011 and expire on 4 January 2012. Thereafter, I specify a balance of term of 7 months to commence on 5 January 2012 and expire on 4 August 2012 . Parole is to be supervised. 

44In respect of the charges of Possess Prohibited Drug, and Possess Ammunition, as I would ordinarily impose a fine in respect of those matters, and a substantial custodial sentence has been imposed on the principal count, I deal with each of those matters by imposing a conviction and not imposing any further sentence pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

2757528,R v Benjamin James WATSON [2011] NSWSC 839,"Judgment 

1The accused, Benjamin James Watson, has been charged under the Crimes Act 1900 with the murder of his mother, Helen Fay Watson, at Lake Bathurst on 10 March 2010. H e has been assessed as being fit to plead and stand trial by two psychiatrists, Dr Robert Lewin and Dr Olav Nielssen. There was accordingly no issue under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 as to the accused's fitness to be tried for the offence with which he has been charged. 

2The accused again pleaded not guilty to the charge, when the hearing proceeded before me on 1 August 2011. The accused is presumed to be innocent. He does not dispute that he was responsible for the acts which caused Ms Watson's death, but he relies on the defence of mental illness. 

3That defence is supported by the opinions of Dr Lewin and Dr Nielssen. They were both of the view that at the relevant time, the accused was suffering from a mental illness, such that he was deprived of the capacity to know that what he was doing was morally wrong. Their reports were in evidence and they were not required for cross-examination. 

4The trial proceeded before me as a judge sitting alone without a jury; the accused having made an election for such a trial in May 2011, under s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, after having received advice from his solicitor Ms Coultas-Roberts. That election was thereafter consented to by the Crown. 

5Section 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that a judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury, may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of guilt. In such cases the judgment must include the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact upon which the judge relies (s 133(2)). If any act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury, the judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter (s 133(3)). I have had regard to those obligations in coming to the conclusions which I have reached on the evidence. 

6It is only if I am satisfied that the Crown has proven the elements constituting the offence of murder, that I am required to consider the defence of mental illness which the accused has raised. 

The parties' cases 

7There was no issue between the parties as to any of the matters which fall to me to decide, including that the accused killed Ms Watson; that the defence of mental illness was established; and as to the orders which should be made. Still, consideration must be given to whether the Crown has proven the offence charged and whether the accused has established the defence he relies on. 

The accused's background 

8There was no disagreement between the parties about any of the facts. A statement of agreed facts, as well as various other documents were in evidence. The accused has no criminal history. 

9In March 2010, the accused was living with Ms Watson, on a property at Lake Bathurst, outside Goulburn. For some years he had resided in a caravan at the rear of that property. Ms Watson had five adult children, including the accused. 

10One of the accused's sisters, made a statement in which she described the accused's background. He grew up at home with his parents and four sisters. Their father died in 1996, when the accused was in year 9. Afterwards, Ms Watson supported the family. She completed a TAFE course in welfare and obtained employment with the Smith Family. 

11The accused had learning difficulties at school and left in year 9. He first obtained work as a farm hand on a nearby property and later moved to Parkes, where he obtained employment in a mine. He was away for about a year. It was during this period that he began using drugs. This seemed to lead to a gradual decline in his mental health, symptomised by paranoia and hallucinations. 

12In 2002, he left home to live with his girlfriend. That relationship lasted some 18 months, during which he was admitted to the Chisholm Ross Centre, after an incident at work. When his relationship broke down, he lived with another sister in Goulburn. His family members pursued medical treatment for the accused, but medication did not appear to help him. He continued experiencing hallucinations and paranoia. He was referred to Mental Health and began seeing a psychiatrist, Dr Ilchef. 

13Ms Watson also left the property to live in Goulburn in 2002. Later, while being treated by Dr Ilchef, the accused moved in with his mother. His sister believed he was then responding to treatment, but had good and bad days, due to drugs and alcohol. In 2008, Ms Watson and the accused moved back to the property at Lake Bathurst, where the accused was observed to be drinking alcohol heavily. Mid-year, Ms Watson told her that he had begun threatening her and that she was scared of him. He became obsessed with knives and on one occasion, she saw him playing with a hunting knife and speaking in a threatening manner. 

14On one occasion Ms Watson left to stay elsewhere and her family advised her to call the police, if the accused became threatening. About six months before her death, Ms Watson contacted police, with the result that the accused was again taken to the Chisholm Ross Centre. His sister had not seen her brother much since then. She had spoken to her mother by phone, shortly before her death, but they did not discuss the accused. 

15Another sister saw the accused on 8 March 2010 at her home. She drove him to see Dr Ilchef in Goulburn and waited for him. He told her that his medication had been reduced. On 10 March, she had dinner with Ms Watson and invited her to stay overnight, to save the trip home. Ms Watson declined. 

What happened on 10 March 2010 

16On 10 March 2010, at about 8.59 pm, a 000 call was received by police. The caller, who identified himself as Ben Watson said '[h]ello, yes, I've just killed someone' and directed police to an address, stating that he would wait out the front of the house. The accused discussed with the operator, that he lived at the premises and that he had killed 'someone' there with a knife. A transcript of the 000 call was in evidence. 

17The accused saw a neighbour, who described the offender as appearing pale, with his eyes wide open, as if in shock. He was usually a slow speaker, but he spoke quickly and sharply that night, saying amongst other things '[t]here was a problem at home'. She went to Ms Watson's home and saw the front door open. As she approached, the accused emerged and told her to go home. She asked him about Ms Watson and he told her to go home saying 'I've called the ambulance'. 

18The neighbour returned home at about 9.20 pm and rang 000 and told them what she knew. They indicated that they had received a call for help, but at a different address. She gave them the correct street number and police soon arrived. 

19Police found the accused crouching down behind a vehicle, which was parked in front of the house. The top which he was wearing appeared to have bloodstains on the front. The police activated the police vehicle's 'In Car Vehicle Camera' ('ICV') as they pulled up. Their conversation with the accused was then recorded on the ICV system. The transcript is in evidence. 

20Ms Watson's body was found inside the house, on the floor in a bedroom. Blood was found on the telephone, beside which was a blood stained knife. The accused was cautioned and arrested. When asked his relationship to Ms Watson he said that she was 'a keep'. 

21On 11 March 2010, the accused participated in an electronically recorded interview. The transcript was also in evidence. The accused refused to answer most questions asked about what had happened. 

22When asked his name the accused said that the name he used at the moment was ' Benjamin James Watson' and that he had another name, 'Satan Nostradamus', which his real mother had given him. He said that he suffered from schizophrenia, for which he took oral medication. He also said that he was due to take his medication that day, but he did not like it, it made him feel giddy; a side effect that he had been suffering for the nine months since he had been taking that medication. He said he had been on a higher dose in the past and before that on injections and that he had not taken any drugs or alcohol. 

23Amongst other things which the accused did say was that Ms Watson was not his real mother; that he had met his real mother a couple of months ago; that he had met with her on a couple of occasions at his house; that Ms Watson had then been taken away by police, while his real mother was there, so that he could speak to his real mother. He also thought that his real father was then there, but he did not know their names. When further questioned he said that he knew from years ago, that his real mother was different to Ms Watson, 'from my voices through parents' and that Ray Watson was not his father. Ms Watson's relationship to him was 'a keep', by which he explained he meant 'introduced parenting'; that is, his parents 'pay her to look after me'. They told him she was not his real mother. He said that 'Satan Nostradamus' was his real name on his real birth certificate; that his real parents were in America, where he was born; that he had not been adopted and had DNA tests, when blood was taken while police were there. He said that he felt good when he had the DNA test and that the injections left marks, but he did not have any. 

24The accused also said that he had been put on a 'mind book spell or something' which 'they injected into me'. He explained that 'then they say stuff and then you go to sleep and then you wake up and you can't remember what you've done till later'. He explained that by 'they' he meant the police and the army. 

The cause of death 

25A post mortem examination was conducted which showed that the cause of death was multiple stab and incised wounds to the neck and chest. The autopsy report was in evidence. It showed that Ms Watson suffered extensive stab wounds to the face, neck, chest and right hand. The wounds included a wound to the neck, with complete transection of the trachea and oesophagus and extensive damage to the vascular structures of the neck; another stab wound on the right of the neck, causing damage to the right internal jugular vein and right common carotid artery; and two stab wounds which had penetrated the chest cavity, one of which had completely transected the right internal thoracic artery. There were also defensive wounds on Ms Watson's hands. 

Proof of the Charge 

26The onus falls on the Crown to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the elements of the offence of murder with which the accused has been charged. They are that: 

1. Helen Watson died. 

2. That her death was caused by the acts of the accused, by multiple stabbings. 

3. That at the time of committing those acts the accused i ntended either to kill Helen Watson, or at least intended to cause her grievous bodily harm. 


27As I have said, the accused has the benefit of the presumption of innocence. The Crown must prove all elements of the offence. There was no issue concerning proof of any of the elements of the offence between the parties. 

28On the evidence, I am satisfied that it must be concluded that Ms Watson's death was caused by the fatal stab wounds which she received on 10 March 2010 and that those wounds were inflicted by the accused. 

29When the evidence of what the accused himself said and did that day is considered in light of what various witnesses observed, and what the autopsy report disclosed, I am satisfied that it is beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, by his acts in repeatedly stabbing Ms Watson, caused her death while possessing the requisite intent, namely of killing her. 

The defence of mental illness 

30The defence of mental illness arises to be considered in accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act . That section provides for a special verdict that an accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. It provides that if the evidence at the trial establishes that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done, then, if it appears that the person did the act, but was mentally ill at the time, a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, must be returned. 

31If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned, the Court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act in respect of the person. 

32The onus of proof of a defence of mental illness rests on the accused, on the balance of probabilities (see Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659). The term 'mental illness' is not defined in the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. The test which must be applied is that discussed in R v M'Naghton (1843) 10 CI & F 200 [8 ER 718]. 'Mentally ill' in this context means suffering from a 'defect of reason' or 'a disease of the mind', with the result that the accused did not know the quality and nature of the physical acts which he was doing, or alternatively, if he did know, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. Knowing what is wrong is not the same as knowing that the act committed is against the law (see Stapleton v The Queen [1952] HCA 56; (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367). 

33In this case there is no question that the accused was suffering paranoid schizophrenia at the time he caused Ms Watson's death. There is no suggestion that the accused did not know the quality and nature of the physical acts, which led to Ms Watson's death. The defence was pressed, on the basis that owing to the disease of the mind from which he suffers, that when he caused her death the accused did not know that his actions were morally wrong, and prevented him from thinking rationally about his actions or the consequences of them. 

34In R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-90, Dixon J of the High Court explained what the accused who raises such a defence must prove. His Honour explained at 189 - 90: 

""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people."" 


35The questions raised by the defence relied on must be answered in the context of the evidence as to the accused's outward conduct at the time, which I have dealt with, as well as by reference to the medical opinions of the psychiatrists who have examined the accused, considered in the light of his medical history. 

The accused's history of mental illness 

36The evidence showed that the accused has a long history of mental illness. 

37In November 2003, he was an involuntary patient at Chisholm Ross Centre, after having been scheduled by a doctor at Goulburn Base hospital. A diagnosis of Schizophreniform Psychosis was made, with problems with cannabis use noted. He was discharged in December, when Community Mental Health follow up was recommended, as well as drug and alcohol counselling. In July 2004, when he saw Dr Ilchef, a consultant psychiatrist, there had been no such follow up and he was diagnosed as meeting the criteria for schizophrenia, having had active psychotic symptoms for more than six months. 

38On further examination in September 2004, Dr Ilchef was concerned about the accused's state and in October, a marked deterioration was noted, after a reduction in medication, with the accused experiencing ongoing auditory hallucinations, and persecutory beliefs. 

39In January 2005, he was still experiencing persistent psychotic symptoms and was having difficulty with prescribed medication. Fortnightly injections were then commenced and in early May, Dr Ilchef noted that there had been good response to that medication. On 26 May, however, a nurse at Springfield House, where the accused was obtaining his regular injections, noted that it was obvious that his delusional thoughts were quite strong; he couldn't control them; he admitted hearing voices and believed that he had given the command to bomb the twin towers. 

40By March 2006, Dr Ilchef noted that the accused was having persistent psychotic symptoms, including auditory hallucinations; that he enjoyed some of them, and didn't want them to disappear entirely. They were passing by September, when Dr Ilchef noted that the accused said that he would miss the voices, if they were to stop suddenly. 

41In 2007, the accused's medication was again increased, but he was not always compliant and needed to be pursued by staff in order to ensure that he received his injections. In August, during a home visit, delusional ideas about 'Al Queada' were noted. It was observed that the accused was hearing voices, many from within, and that his conversations with them, upset Ms Watson. Over the following months, Ms Watson indicated to medical staff that the accused's symptoms were increasing. He did not attend an appointment with Dr Ilchef in October and his attendance for injections were also erratic and had to be pursued. 

42By July 2008, Dr Ilchef was of the view that the accused's medication was not adequately treating his psychotic symptoms. During a home visit by his case manager in September, he presented as guarded, hypervigilant and with delusional ideation, believing that he was receiving injections at the police station, which were wiping his mind of memories and that those injections were the consequence of illegal activity. He was closely monitored over the following months. In October, Dr Ilchef observed that he was thin, weary, taciturn and continuing to have complex psychotic experiences, including perceptional disturbances and delusions. Increased medication was considered but not implemented. Increasing reluctance to attend for injections emerged. 

43On 18 February 2009, the accused had received no injections since 15 January. On attendance for an injection he was displaying delusional symptoms, reporting that: 

""he knows about the magic book that is in everyone's head but is no longer under a spell, that his lawyer is American and is probably a Hell's Angel."" 


44The accused did not attend an appointment with Dr Ilchef in March and was again non-compliant with his medication. He informed his case manager by phone that he was not taking medication and was 'heaps better off'. A home visit was attempted, but he did not answer the door. When Ms Watson was telephoned she advised that he was hallucinating and delusional; telling her amongst other things that she wasn't his mother and calling the operator to obtain the 'phone number of Hell's Angels'. On 12 May, Ms Watson advised that the accused was significantly paranoid and at times she had to lock him out of the house and that she had also herself stayed elsewhere. 

45A home visit was conducted and on 14 May, with the assistance of four police officers, a formal assessment was made of the accused. Ms Watson advised that he had threatened to kill her on the previous Saturday evening and had accused her of raping him. Three knives were found hidden in his caravan, but he denied having them. He was scheduled and transported to the Chisholm Ross Centre for assessment. On 22 May, a six month control order was made, requiring him to meet at least twice weekly with his case manager, to attend appointments with Dr Ilchef at least three times per month and to adhere to his prescribed medical regime. He was then released. 

46In early June he was reviewed. The accused sought to reduce his medication, which was declined. Later in June, Dr Ilchef found no clear evidence of positive psychotic symptoms. The accused asked about stopping his medication in six months' time and was advised that he required long term medication. In September he again sought to change his medication, which was refused. Later in September, a change to oral medication was approved, with a further six months Community Treatment Order recommended by Dr Ilchef, to ensure a safe transition to such medication. That was granted in November. In December a reduction of some medication was approved, with close contact to be maintained by his case manager, to monitor any deterioration in his mental state. 

47Between December 2009 and February 2010 there was, however, no contact with the accused, while his case manager was on leave. On 9 February, he was observed to be doing well. In March, a further reduction in medication was approved by Dr Ilchef, with his case manager to monitor him more closely over the next few months. There was, however, no further contact with him before Ms Watson's death. 

The Medical Assessments 

Dr Lewin 

48Dr Lewin provided a report in March 2011, having examined the accused on two occasions. He considered various of the material now in evidence, as well as Dr Nielssen's July 2010 report, the accused's medical record while under the care of Professor Owen and Dr Ilchef, outpatient psychiatric nursing notes, his Justice Health clinical file, and psychiatric assessments undertaken in prison, by a Dr O'Dea. 

49Dr Lewin noted the accused's report of having first experienced mental symptoms in 2000 and an earlier extensive history of marijuana use, from age 14 years. He had tried ice in 2008, but had not used such drugs in 2009 or 2010. He also reported no marijuana use for two to three years before his mother's death, but Dr Lewin noted that there were other reports in the documents he had reviewed. 

50The accused recounted that his first hospital admission was associated with marijuana use. He was then experiencing paranoia and hearing voices. After treatment in hospital for a month, he was discharged, without follow up. His marijuana use then continued intermittently. His attempts to resume work failed. He was unsure about the times of his later hospitalisations, but recalled that this had occurred after he had experienced violent impulses and had threatened his mother, who he thought was raping him and doing bad things. After discharge, he saw a Community Mental Health nurse monthly. 

51The accused reported being treated with oral medication and by injection, with Dr Ilchef changing medications and dosages over time. In 2010, he described being delusional, hearing voices and instructions conveyed by Al Qaeda. He was being given instructions to harm people. He was discharged from hospital in early 2010, but he continued hearing voices on a daily basis. 

52In the weeks leading up to Ms Watson's death, the accused claimed he was not drinking alcohol, and had ceased taking marijuana or other drugs. He was experiencing persistent phenomena, including believing that Ms Watson was not his mother; that she had hurt him before and had raped him in his sleep. When asked about his mental state in the days leading up to her death, he said 'I don't really know for sure. What I done, it was not a good thing. I should not have done it'. He described having had violent outbursts, which he attributed to his medication. He felt angry, believing '[p]eople were against ya ... everyone was against ya'. He explained that this included his mother and doctors. He believed that when he told them the medication was not right, the doctor just 'fiddled' with it. 

53The accused also described voices making him do things, against his best interests, including throwing out things such as CDs or a belt buckle. He tried to ignore the voices, but sometimes followed the instructions. He also explained his use of the name 'Nostradamus' and his firm belief that his mother was not his real mother and that he had received visits from a couple, who identified themselves as his real parents. 

54The accused had limited recollection of the events of the day of Ms Watson's death. He had no memory of a knife and could not remember his thoughts leading up to her death. He could recall ringing the police and telling them he had killed someone. 

55The accused also had memories of taking medication in the preceding days, which he found uncomfortable and distressing. He described feeling angry and dizzy and remembered believing the medicine was wrong for him. He reported pacing and a general feeling of being unsettled all the time, and feeling compelled to move, being unable to sit still, with a compulsion to walk. Dr Lewin was of the view that this was consistent with a history of Akathisia, a common complication of the use of neuroleptic medication, often experienced as intensely distressing. 

56The accused described similar symptoms on an ongoing basis over previous months, but reported that he had not described them to Dr Ilchef. What he told Dr Ilchef about, was his thoughts of getting off the medication, so that he would feel better and could fix up the house. He reported that in the months preceding Ms Watson's death, his thoughts were not directed towards hurting her and he had no plans to harm her. At that time he was attending all his appointments, endeavouring to reduce his medication, which he was taking regularly, as prescribed. Dr Lewin observed, however, that the accused was clearly unsure of the dates and the time sequence of important events. 

57As to his mental state in March 2010, the accused recalled being violent in January and February, after he ceased receiving injections and transferred to oral medication. He reported sometimes telling Dr Ilchef about the voices he heard and his symptoms worsening, but said that sometimes he withheld the information from Dr Ilchef, because he feared the medication being increased. He wanted to get off it, believing that it did not help him and that he did not like the feelings it gave him. 

58The accused also described the reduction in medication in the two days preceding his mother's death, as worsening his symptoms. Dr Lewin noted that there was no independent confirmation of this history, but that such a pattern of worsening Akathisia, was consistent with clinical experience. 

59The accused said that while he was getting on well with his mother in the weeks before and had not had thoughts of violence, in the days before her death, the voices were hounding him constantly. Dr Lewin observed that the Community Mental Health Service Clinical notes recorded that his family were particularly concerned at this time, taking him to the appointment with the treating psychiatrist. 

60The accused could not recall what he then reported to Dr Ilchef, but said that he did not approach him with a plan of trying to persuade him to stop the medication. His memory had become clearer since, with changed medication and he could remember 'crazy talk' when interviewed by police. He said the name 'Satan Nostradamus' had just come to him. 

61Dr Lewin noted that with treatment while in prison, the accused described the voices having settled, feeling better overall, memory and cognition improvement and that he had no current persecutory, delusional ideas. Dr Lewin outlined the basis of his assessment that in March 2011, Mr Watson had sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he would rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the Court and to his counsel. 

62Dr Lewin diagnosed that the accused was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, against a background of polysubstance dependence. His opinion was that there was abundant evidence of delusional thinking, during the accused's two interviews, when he gave a description of elaborate and complex patterns of persecutory delusions in the past, which he appeared to repudiate, but a number of which he continued to cling to. 

63Dr Lewin noted emotional blunting, poverty of thought, and a continuing acceptance of bizarre beliefs, including delusional beliefs about Ms Watson's identity and her repeated sexual assaults of him, which the accused found unremarkable. 

64On Dr Lewin's diagnosis, in the period from discharge from hospital in May 2009 and March 2010, the accused had exhibited acute psychotic symptoms and objective signs of mental illness. His symptoms reportedly settled in late 2009 and early 2010, but he repeatedly complained of side effects of prescribed neuroleptic medication. 

65In his report to Dr Ilchef three days before Ms Watson's death, the accused had reported being in good spirits, with no psychotic symptoms reported. A reduction in medication dose was then prescribed. The accused had no memory of his state on the day of Ms Watson's death, but was described by Dr O'Dea, several days later, as being acutely unwell. 

66Dr Lewin concluded that at the time of Ms Watson's death it was 'more than likely' that the accused was acutely unwell. There was long term evidence that he was suffering from a chronic and severe mental illness, which was resistant to treatment. While the treating psychiatrist came to the conclusion in March 2010 that the accused's condition was then less than acute, that it was then acute was supported by the accused's long term abundant history of schizophrenia, including persecutory delusional ideas about his mother, the accused's behaviour at the time and Dr O'Dea's assessment. 

67In Dr Lewin's assessment, on the basis of the accused's cluster of persistent delusional ideas about his mother, which included that she sexually assaulted him during the night, his understanding of his actions was impaired. He was of the view that the accused appeared to have been unable to recognise that his behaviour in stabbing his mother, was morally wrong. The accused had described the ability to resist other delusional beliefs and to resist command hallucinations at other times, as well as a longstanding struggle with symptoms of Akathisia, which became more intense with the reduction of medication. In Dr Lewin's opinion, this may have magnified the intensity of the accused's response to his psychotic symptoms. Dr Lewin opined that '[i]t appears that he was then unable to think rationally as to the reasons which might guide him in a decision to act'. 

68Dr Lewin also noted that there had been improvement in the accused's condition, during a prolonged period of stable inpatient care at Silverwater, with use of antipsychotic medication and detoxification for marijuana and stimulant substances. In March 2011, he found that mild residual symptoms of his schizophrenia illness were evident, in a mild/subacute phase, at a time when the accused was not unduly sedated. Dr Lewin concluded, however, that the accused's severe illness had responded only partially to an 'energetic psychiatric treatment'; that he had made only a partial recovery and that he had gained only limited insight. In all of the circumstances, Dr Lewin was of the view that the accused had a basis for the defence of mental illness. 

Dr Nielssen 

69Dr Nielssen also reviewed various of the material reviewed by Dr Lewin. He interviewed the accused in July 2010 and then noted a similar, albeit less detailed history to that later taken from the accused by Dr Lewin. At that time, the accused still adhered to the belief that Ms Watson was not his mother; that he had met his biological parents; and that his beliefs were not based on his symptoms of schizophrenia. He also then persisted in a belief that he was affected by 'mind books'. He did accept that hearing voices was probably a symptom of a mental illness. He described the ineffectiveness of the treatment he was receiving at the time of Ms Watson's death, in stopping the voices, which had told him how he'd been wronged and had suggested that he kill his mother. 

70The accused described a belief at the time of his mother's death, that she wasn't his mother and that she had arranged to have some blokes rape him, at a time when he had been in a trance. He had read the narrative in the police facts sheet and felt ashamed of himself and sorry for what he had done, but denied being related to his sister. He also denied any memory of the assault itself, although he could remember ringing the police and telling them things recorded in the record of interview. He explained his use of the name 'Satan Nostradamus'; his description of Ms Watson as 'a keep'; and his history of being at the Chisholm Ross Centre, after arguing with his mother. 

71The accused also gave an account to Dr Nielssen of his mental illness after heavy marijuana use and experimentation with ice. He described ongoing hallucinations and lapses in awareness and insisted that he was not related to his sisters and was not sure if they were his biological siblings. 

72Dr Nielssen described the accused as evidencing blunted reactions, consistent with chronic schizophrenia.  He reported symptoms such as hallucinations, which were then decreasing in frequency, but continued expressing delusional beliefs. Impairment in intellectual function consistent with chronic mental illness was also noted. Dr Nielssen diagnosed that the accused was suffering chronic schizophrenia, based on his presentation and history. 

73Dr Nielssen also noted that he was not thought to be acutely unwell by Dr Ilchef, three days before Ms Watson's death. While he was then taking a relatively low dose of medication, which was further reduced, the accused reported then experiencing chronic auditory hallucinations and bizarre delusional beliefs. 

74Dr Nielssen was also of the view that the accused had a defence of mental illness, given his severe form of schizophrenia, a disease which produced a pattern of abnormality of the mind, recognised in law as a disease of the mind. The effect of an exacerbation of his chronic and largely treatment resistant form of schizophrenia meant that at the time of Ms Watson's death, he was unable to recognise that his actions were morally wrong. Nor could he reason with sense and composure about the consequences of his actions. Dr Nielssen concluded that the accused had only made a partial recovery and continued to express delusional beliefs. 

Conclusion on the defence 

75Given the circumstances of Ms Watson's death, and how the accused came to have had his medication reduced at a time when he was acutely unwell, I have outlined in some detail the basis for the consistent opinions held by Dr Lewin and Dr Nielssen, that the defence of mental illness is available to the accused. Having considered all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the experts' opinions were persuasive and that it must be accepted that the accused has established that as a consequence of his mental illness, when he killed his mother he was unable to understand that what he was doing was wrong. 

76The accused suffers from a persistent, treatment resistant form of paranoid schizophrenia. As a result, he has long suffered from paranoia and persistent hallucinations and delusional beliefs, including long held beliefs about his relationship with his mother and the serious harm she has done him. He also appears to have suffered a well understood reaction to the medication he was being treated with. The result was that in early 2010, at a time when he was acutely unwell, he was apparently not frank with his treating psychiatrist, as to either the ongoing symptoms of the disease which he was suffering, or the side effects of the treatment he was receiving. 

77The accused was then seeking to have his medication reduced, in order to alleviate these side effects. In March 2010, the accused was on a seemingly low dose of medication, which was then reduced even further, even though he was in fact acutely ill. The further reduction of his medication appears to have exacerbated the side effects which he was experiencing. The end result was that, at the time that he killed his mother, he was labouring under such hallucinations and delusional beliefs, that it must be accepted that he was not able to understand that what he was doing, when he caused her death, was wrong. 

78Even the treatment which he has since received while in prison, which appears to have had positive effects, has not been completely effective in addressing his persistent delusional beliefs, which are the ongoing symptoms of the illness from which he suffers. 

The consequences under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 

79Section 37 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act requires that consideration be given to the legal and practical consequences of a finding of mental illness, including the existence and composition of the Mental Health Review Tribunal constituted under the Mental Health Act 2007 and its functions with respect to forensic patients. 

80The effect of an order made under s 38 is that provided for in s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, which provides: 
""39 Effect of finding and declaration of mental illness 
(1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate. 
(2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release. 
(3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order."" 


81In this case the accused sought no order for his release. 

82The role and responsibilities of the Mental Health Review Tribunal have been repeatedly described. Hall J gave such an explanation in Regina v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177, an explanation which I respectfully adopt: 
""69 The legal and practical consequences of a finding that the accused is ""not guilty on the ground of mental illness"" may be shortly stated. 
70 The statute which governs cases like this, namely, s.39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act , requires me to consider making an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice, this means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes what is known as a forensic patient and falls under the supervision of a body called the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
71 The Mental Health Review Tribunal consists of a president and his/her deputy, who must be a lawyer. It also consists of two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist. The third member is a person who has suitable qualifications or experience for the task. 
72 The Tribunal is required to review the accused's case as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody. The Tribunal may make orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment, or as to this release. 
73 The Tribunal cannot make an order for the release of the accused unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. The Minister for Health and the Attorney General may appear before the Tribunal, or make submissions to the Tribunal, in relation to the possible release of the accused. 
74 Where an order for release is not made, the Tribunal orders result in continued detention, care and treatment in a place and manner specified by the Tribunal. 
75 After the initial review, the Tribunal must, at least once every six months, again review the case and make orders as to the accused's continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place or as to his release. 
76 If release is ordered, then it may be on conditions or it may be unconditional. If any condition is breached, or where the mental condition of the accused has deteriorated so that he may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the Tribunal for his apprehension, care and detention. 
77 The conditions which could be prescribed include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication, appointments with health care professionals, enrolment in educational and therapeutic programmes, to ensure that the accused is properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions caring for forensic patients. 
78 Security conditions (as necessary) are in place while the accused is detained in a hospital, prison or other place or if he is allowed to be temporarily absent from the place of detention. 

79 The accused may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release, or where released on conditions and those conditions have expired over time. However, as I have previously explained, the accused will only ever be released when the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered."" 

Conclusion 

83For the reasons I have explained, I am satisfied on the evidence, on the balance of probabilities, that the accused is not guilty of the offence with which he has been charged, on the ground of mental illness. 

Orders 

84I find that at the time that the accused committed the acts which caused the death of Helen Fay Watson, that he was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for his acts. I am accordingly required to return a special verdict under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. 

85Benjamin James Watson, upon the charge that on 10 March 2010 at Lake Bathurst in the State of New South Wales you did murder Helen Fay Watson, pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I find that you are not guilty by reason of mental illness. 

86I order that Benjamin James Watson be detained, pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in Long Bay Prison Hospital or such other facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine, until released by due process of law. 

87The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the judgment and orders made by this Court and to provide the Tribunal with copies of the exhibits in these proceedings. 

88Finally, I extend my deepest sympathy to Ms Watson's family and friends who must all mourn her tragic death. What the evidence has revealed has shown the terrible loss which they have unquestionably suffered, as well as the longstanding, difficult circumstances which led to that awful end result. I hope that it is of some small comfort to them to know how our society has acted to deal with her death, and that the circumstances of her sad passing has not gone unnoticed.

2757535,Evans v Queanbeyan City Council [2011] NSWCA 230,"HEADNOTE 
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
In November 2006 Mr Keith Evans was diagnosed with lung cancer. Mr Evans smoked between 20 and 35 cigarettes a day for approximately 40 years up to 1991. He also experienced occupational exposure to asbestos dust of variable intensity. Mr Evans worked for Queanbeyan City Council from 1975 until 1990. Amaca Pty Ltd was an important manufacturer of asbestos building products throughout Mr Evans' working life. In the Dust Diseases Tribunal, Mr Evans' widow, Mrs Lola Evans, claimed that Mr Evans' lung cancer was caused by exposure to asbestos dust in circumstances imposing responsibility on the respondents. Judge Curtis was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Evans' lung cancer was caused by exposure to asbestos: Evans v Queanbeyan City Council [2010] NSWDDT 7. Mrs Evans appeals against that decision. 
The Court held, dismissing the appeal: 
1. The law as to negligence requires that a plaintiff prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant's wrong caused or materially contributed to his or her loss; it is not sufficient for the plaintiff to show that the wrong materially increased the risk of harm, where medical science does not permit any further proof: [20]-[22]; [56], [93], [103] 

St George Club v Hines Ltd (1961) 35 ALJR 106; Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; 240 CLR 111; Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; 240 CLR 537; Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504; Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262 applied. 
Sydney South West Area Health Service v Stamoulis [2009] NSWCA 153 distinguished and doubted. 
2. Although there was evidence of a biological synergistic effect of asbestos dust and tobacco smoke in causing lung cancer, the primary judge was entitled to reject, as inconsistent with the epidemiological evidence, the hypothesis that both agents probably worked together in a majority of cases and thus in respect of Mr Evans' carcinoma: [7]-[19], [80]-[83]. 
3. The appeal being limited, relevantly, to a decision of the Tribunal in point of law, the fact that there was evidence both supportive of and adverse to the plaintiff's claim precluded a successful appeal based on an assessment of that evidence: [70], [99]. 

Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 (NSW), s 32(1). 
4. The primary judge did not err in undertaking his own calculations as to the level of exposure to asbestos dust and the resultant relative risk. His Honour was entitled to reach his own conclusion as to the level of exposure, based on the evidence before him and to apply the procedure for determining relative risk revealed in the epidemiology: [6], [104]-[110]. 

Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] 21; 277 ALR 611 distinguished. 
5. The primary judge did not adopt a 'but for' test of causation, to the exclusion of proper consideration of material causation in circumstances where two agents operated causally: at [3]-[5] and [85]-[99]. 

Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; 240 CLR 111 distinguished. 
(per Allsop P) 
6. To the extent that English case-law supports liability based on a material increase in risk, adoption of such a principle in this jurisdiction must lie with the High Court: [52]. 

McGhee v National Coal Board [1973] 1 WLR 1; Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2002] UKHL 22; [2003] 1 AC 32; Barker v Corus UK Ltd [2006] UKHL 20; [2006] 2 AC 572; Sienkiewicz (Administratrix of the Estate of Enid Costello Deceased) v Greif (UK) Ltd [2011] UKSC 10 discussed. 


			Judgment 

1ALLSOP P: I have read the reasons of Hodgson JA and Basten JA. Subject to what (largely by way of elaboration) appears below, I agree with them. I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA. 

2The appellant, Mrs Lola Evans (the widow and executrix of the estate of Mr Keith Evans), appeals in point of law against the orders made by the Dust Diseases Tribunal (Curtis J) that there be judgment for the defendant. Various complaints were made as to legal error in his Honour's approach. 

3The appellant's first complaint is that the primary judge imposed a but-for test of causation in circumstances where such a case was not put forward by the appellant. That argument should be rejected. At [144] of his reasons, the primary judge set out the arguments put forward by Mr Little SC (who, with Mr Foord, appeared for Mrs Evans below and on appeal): 

""Mr Little SC argues that: 

(a) In all cases where lung cancer is contracted following exposure to the carcinogens cigarette smoke and asbestos, each agent materially contributes to the development of the disease. 

(b) In the alternative, the fibre burden of Mr Evans was probably sufficient to materially contribute to his lung cancer in any event."" 

These were arguments based on causation by material contribution. 

4The primary judge's conclusion at [201] of his reasons was expressed in terms of these arguments: 

""I am not persuaded that it is more probable than not that any contribution of asbestos to the cause or progression of Mr Evans' lung cancer was, in the light of his smoking history, material."" 

5His Honour's reasoning between those points ([145]-[162] as to (a) set out at [3] above, and [163]-[194] as to (b) set out at [3] above) dealt with the matter in this way. The primary judge did not limit himself to a but-for test in the way complained of. 

6The appellant's second complaint is that the judge impermissibly used his position as an expert tribunal going outside the evidence in calculating fibre load: cf Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 277 ALR 611. This argument should be rejected. The task undertaken by the primary judge at [31]-[62] was not shown to adopt a process or conclusion to have been derived outside the evidence. 

7The appellant's third complaint (which is related to the first complaint) was that the primary judge impermissibly used the epidemiological evidence beyond the reason for which it was led by the appellant. The appellant submitted that epidemiological evidence was only led to prove that asbestos was a carcinogenic agent. The primary judge, wrongly, it was submitted, used it to reject a proposition that the relative risk from asbestos (whether alone or in conjunction with smoking) was less than 2 (and so not proved to be more probable than not). 

8This third complaint should be rejected. As I said above, the structure of the primary judge's reasons after [149] revealed that he dealt with a case based on material contribution. The first argument put forward ((a) at [3] above) was that for which Dr Leigh contended - that in a manner not fully understood, tobacco and asbestos always worked together synergistically in causing lung cancer. According to this hypothesis, the asbestos can be taken to materially contribute to the cancer as part of one intermingled causative agent. The essence of the proposition was described at [145]-[148] of his Honour's reasons. His Honour said that the proposition that this occurred, in all cases, was ""theoretically sound"": [145]. His Honour found, however, as follows (at [149]-[150]): 

""[149] I am persuaded that asbestos and cigarette smoking may act in combination in contributing to the development of lung cancer. 

[150] I am not persuaded that in all cases, and in particular in this case of Mr Evans, that the contribution of asbestos must have occurred, or if it did, that the contribution was material. "" (Emphasis in original.) 

9These were plainly factual findings. Reasons for these findings were given in the paragraphs that followed. If those reasons contained legal error the factual findings might be vulnerable. Before turning to the reasons and the complaints made of them, something should be said about the question posed in [150] whether the contribution of asbestos ""must"" have occurred. The question can be seen to reflect some of the language used in Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; 240 CLR 111 at 133 [52] and [53], and 134 [60]. It might be, perhaps, that, rather than a question framed in terms of certainty (""must""), it would have been sufficient for it to be concluded that it was probable in any given case that smoking and asbestos worked synergistically together to cause cancer. In any event, that is not how the case was run and his Honour cannot be criticised for positing and answering the proposition put forward by Mrs Evans as the foundation for her relief. 

10The first reason for the factual conclusion in [150] is set out in [151]: 

""First, because both Professor Breslin and Professor Tattersall, while accepting the theory, dismissed the contribution of asbestos in Mr Evans' case because of its relative insignificance. I accept that a contribution may be material although it is minor but I believe that, in context, the opinions of both medical experts are to the effect that the contribution was not minor but insignificant, that is to say, immaterial."" 

11This reason was said to be illogical; and illogicality was said to reveal legal error. Assuming without deciding the second of those propositions (cf Amaba Pty Ltd v Booth [2010] NSWCA 344), the illogicality was said to flow from the judge's own findings at [168] and [177] in which he found ""significant asbestos exposure"": 

""[168] My finding of 21.9 fibre/ml/years is approximately six times greater than Mr Roger's estimate of 3.24 fibre/ml/years and Mr Pickford's 'probable' scenario of 3.4 fibre/ml/years. It is nearly double Mr Pickford's 'worst case' scenario. This finding is compatible with the description 'significant asbestos exposure'. It is also consistent with the circumstance that the cumulative dose of asbestos fibre required to double the risk of contracting lung cancer requires a significant exposure for a prolonged period of time. 

... 

[177] The presence of diffuse pleural thickening does indicate significant asbestos exposure, but I have no evidence that correlates the presence of diffuse pleural thickening with an increased risk of contracting lung cancer. Professor Breslin says he took into account the presence of the pleural thickening."" 

12The error in this argument is revealed by an examination of the evidence of both Profs Breslin and Tattersall. The ""relative insignificance"" of the asbestos exposure for the theory of multiplicative or synergistic operation of smoking and asbestos was, for Prof Tattersall, lower than 25 fibre/ml/years (the ""absolute bottom end of any risk calculation for lung cancer"": Black 138 (T p 133)). Professor Breslin gave similar evidence based on Professor Pooley's measurement: see [110] and [111] of the primary judge's reasons. These views from the two experts, who accepted the theory of the multiplicative or synergistic operation of tobacco and asbestos, provided the factual foundation for the primary judge's conclusion. There was a difference between significant exposure and significant or material contribution. 

13Further, the presence of pleural thickening was recognised by the primary judge to indicate significant asbestos exposure ([177]), but there was not evidence acceptable to him that this amounted to an increased risk of cancer: [170]-[177] and [111]. This, likewise, was a factual conclusion. 

14The second reason for the factual conclusion in [150] is set out in [152]: 

""Secondly, because Dr Leigh concedes that in a particular case the contribution of asbestos may play a very small part, and that he could not say that, more probably than not, Mr Evans would not have contracted his cancer in the absence of the asbestos exposure."" (Emphasis in original.) 

15As to [152], whilst the primary judge referred to Dr Leigh's evidence (at Black 89 (T p 86)) that he could not say that more probably than not Mr Evans would not have contracted his cancer in the absence of the asbestos exposure, I do not conclude from that that his Honour was not continuing to deal with the question of material contribution. 

16The third reason for the factual conclusion in [150] is set out in [153]: 

""Thirdly, because epidemiological studies predict that among the class of persons who share Mr Evans' smoking history, the greatest number of those who contract lung cancer after exposure to an equivalent asbestos fibre burden are persons who would have contracted the disease in any event."" 

17As to [153], again this might be seen as relevant to a ""but-for"" test and causation otherwise based on material contribution of asbestos through synergistic operation. It deals with the proposition at [150] at a level of analysis beyond that put by the appellant. To that extent, it may not be a relevant reason for the conclusion in [150]. It does not, however, undermine the primary foundation for [150] - the evidence of Profs Breslin and Tattersall that the multiplicative or synergistic theory does not apply to the case of Mr Evans, even though they accepted the theory. 

18The fourth reason for the factual conclusion in [150] is set out in [154]-[155]: 

""[154] Fourthly, because, even if asbestos and smoking combined causally in the development of lung cancers in all cases, the contribution of asbestos to the development of lung cancer in smokers may take the form of hastening the development of the cancer. That would reconcile the certainty of epidemiological prediction that a certain number of lung cancers will develop in smokers in any event, with the plausible biological theory that the additional risk factor of asbestos exposure will contribute to that inevitable development by way of acceleration. 

[155] That acceleration may be minimal or substantial and yet not change the inevitability of the tumour's appearance. If a motor car without brakes travels at a certain speed toward a collision there comes a time when any additional impetus by way of acceleration will not affect the inevitability of disaster."" 

19As to [154]-[155], this reason was not the subject of debate at trial. With respect to the learned trial judge, I do not understand the relevance of [154]-[155] to the factual conclusion in [150]. Nevertheless, it does not undermine [150] insofar as that paragraph is supported by Professors Breslin and Tattersall. 

20The appellant's fourth complaint is based on a fundamental legal question. The appellant submitted that the primary judge failed to apply what should be taken to be the law of causation concerning tortious wrongs in Australia. It was submitted that in circumstances were the defendant created a risk of injury and that injury eventuated and, in circumstances where medical science did not permit a causal conclusion to be drawn on the balance of probabilities, it was sufficient to attribute causal responsibility to a defendant that it materially increased the risk to the plaintiff of suffering that injury. As I understand the submission, the causal connection of material contribution may (not necessarily must) be drawn from that increase in risk alone. Reliance was placed on Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2002] UKHL 22; [2003] 1 AC 32; Barker v Corus UK Ltd [2006] UKHL 20; [2006] 2 AC 572; Sienkiewicz (Administratrix of the Estate of Enid Costello Deceased) v Greif (UK) Ltd [2011] UKSC 10; McGhee v National Coal Board [1973] 1 WLR 1; Resurfice Corp v Hanke 2007 SCC 7 ; [2007] 1 SCR 333; Sydney South West Area Health Service v Stamoulis [2009] NSWCA 153; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak [2009] HCA 48; 239 CLR 420; and Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw [1956] AC 613. 

21The primary judge, concluded at [201] (see [4] above) that any contribution of asbestos to Mr Evans' cancer was not material. His Honour, however, did not approach the matter by reference to the above proposition. If he had done so, the evidence may have permitted a relevant causal conclusion, on that hypothesis. 

22The submission should, however, be rejected. Subject to the views of the High Court in respect of any development of the common law or to the operation of any legislation, it can be concluded that at common law, as a general proposition, the increasing of risk of harm by a tortious act is, alone, insufficient for a conclusion of causation by material contribution to that harm or for a conclusion of responsibility in law for that harm. 

23It can be accepted that in Resurfice Corp v Hanke at 342-343 [24]-[25], the Supreme Court of Canada expressed the framework for ""material contribution"" in the absence of a positive conclusion from the ""but-for"" test as follows: 

""However, in special circumstances, the law has recognized exceptions, to the basic 'but for' test, and applied a 'material contribution' test. Broadly speaking, the cases in which the 'material contribution' test is properly applied involve two requirements. 

First, it must be impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's negligence caused the plaintiff's injury using the 'but for' test. The impossibility must be due to factors that are outside of the plaintiff's control; for example, current limits of scientific knowledge. Second, it must be clear that the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff, thereby exposing the plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of injury, and the plaintiff must have suffered that form of injury. In other words, the plaintiff's injury must fall within the ambit of the risk created by the defendant's breach. In those exceptional cases where these two requirements are satisfied, liability may be imposed, even though the 'but for' test is not satisfied, because it would offend basic notions of fairness and justice to deny liability by applying a 'but for' approach."" 

24Further, it can be accepted that the House of Lords and now the United Kingdom Supreme Court has modified the common law in the United Kingdom by accepting that, at least as a special rule in mesothelioma claims, fairness and justice demand that the factual link between the wrongful act and the harm to the plaintiff need only be a wrongful exposure of the plaintiff by the defendant to an amount of asbestos that would materially increase the risk of mesothelioma: Fairchild; Barker v Corus; and Sienkiewicz. In Sienkiewicz, the statements of principle may also be seen not to be limited to mesothelioma. 

25Further, it can be accepted that at the foundation of the House of Lords' views in Fairchild and Barker v Corus and of the Supreme Court's views in Sienkiewicz was a re-interpretation of McGhee (contrary to the interpretation given to it by the House of Lords in the 1980s) that supported the appellant's fundamental proposition underlying her fourth complaint. McGhee was not, of course, a mesothelioma case. 

26The unanimous decision of the House of Lords in Fairchild can be expressed by reference to the headnote: 

""... where an employee had been exposed by different defendants, during different periods of employment, to inhalation of asbestos dust in breach of each defendant's duty to protect him from the risk of contracting mesothelioma and where that risk had eventuated but, in current medical knowledge, the onset of the disease could not be attributed to any particular or cumulative wrongful exposure, a modified approach to proof of causation was justified; that in such a case proof that each defendant's wrongdoing had materially increased the risk of contracting the disease was sufficient to satisfy the causal requirements for his liability; and that, accordingly, applying that approach and in the circumstances of each case, the claimants could prove, on a balance of probabilities, the necessary causal connection to establish the defendants' liability."" 

27The skill of the author of the headnote was able to avoid reference to the different ways this was expressed by their Lordships. Aspects of these differences emerged in Barker v Corus . Nevertheless, what was common to the several views of their Lordships in Fairchild was the necessity to depart from the common law's usual rule of the need for proof on the balance of probabilities in circumstances where it could be unjust for there to be no recovery. See in particular Fairchild at 66 [32] per Lord Bingham of Cornhill, 69 [40] per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, 73 [56] per Lord Hoffmann and 112 [155] per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. These views reflected the expression of the matter by Justice (now Chief Justice) McLachlin at the commencement of an article written by her Ladyship in 1998, ""Negligence Law - Proving the Connection"" in N J Mullany and A M Linden (Eds) Torts Tomorrow: A Tribute to John Fleming (LBC Information Services, Sydney 1998). The foundational legal and moral premise that can be seen in Fairchild and in the introductory comments in the above article is that tort law, as an aspect of the rule of law, is concerned with righting wrongful conduct. If self-evident wrongs (so characterised by legitimate human perceptions) are not recognised by the law's rules, and thus go unremedied, people who legitimately feel themselves victims will be left with a sense of injustice. A legitimate sense of injustice should not be the product of the rule of law. 

28The avowed change to causal principle by the House of Lords that materially increasing the risk of injury was sufficient factual tortious involvement for causation (or attribution of responsibility) to be established was narrowly confined by all their Lordships in Fairchild : at 40 [2] and 55 [21] per Lord Bingham, 70 [43] per Lord Nicholls, 74 [ 61] per Lord Hoffmann, 91 [108] per Lord Hutton and 118 [170] per Lord Rodger. Crucial to that confinement were factors such as the causal element being singular (only exposure to asbestos) and the inability of medical science to explain cause in terms of a balance of probabilities. 

29Further illumination of the policy-based change to the common law in Fairchild can be seen from the lively debate in the judgments in Barker v Corus as to what was, in fact, decided in Fairchild . At issue in Barker v Corus was the extent of several liability of the wrongdoers who had exposed the plaintiff to the asbestos, causing a material increase in risk of contracting mesothelioma. Though all their Lordships (with a caveat by Lord Rodger: Barker v Corus at 610 [100]-[102]) came to the view that the exceptional approach in Fairchild should extend to circumstances where not all the exposure was tortiously caused by the defendants, a restriction was placed on the principle being that there must be one causative agent: Barker v Corus at 587 [24] per Lord Hoffmann (his Lordship recanting his view in Fairchild that this limitation was unprincipled), 599 [64] per Lord Scott of Foscote, 611 [104] per Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and 615 [121] per Baroness Hale of Richmond. Save for Lord Rodger, all were agreed that the extent of responsibility of individual defendants should be measured by reference to the extent to which they had increased the risk, based on the respective length and intensity of exposure: Barker v Corus at 589-590 [35]-[36] per Lord Hoffmann, 599 [62] per Lord Scott, 612 [109] per Lord Walker and 616 [126] per Baroness Hale. The majority, recognising that it was justice and fairness that had given rise to the exceptional rule, thought that justice and fairness should limit the defendants' respective liabilities by reference to the wrongful exposure. Lord Rodger dissented on this point - all defendants were liable in full, the change in rule in Fairchild being a relaxation of the rules of causation - thus each caused the damage. 

30At this point, the Parliament intervened with the Compensation Act 2006 (UK), which reflected Lord Rodger's view in Barker v Corus as to the responsibility of defendants in mesothelioma cases, and not the majority's view of fairness. 

31The above discussion of Fairchild and Barker v Corus reveals, at once, the policy questions involved in any conclusion that increasing risk is sufficient for a conclusion of causation or causal responsibility or legal responsibility. Such policy questions are a matter for the High Court, not this Court. 

32Fairchild , Barker v Corus and Sienkiewicz all discuss Bonnington Castings and McGhee . Before saying something about these cases, it is to be noted that the common law of Australia has long recognised a legitimate causal connection, in circumstances where a but-for analysis does not give a clear answer, which can be described as ""material contribution"". The defendant's tortious acts amount to a cause of the plaintiff's injury if the plaintiff establishes that his or her injuries are ""caused or materially contributed to"" by the defendant's wrongful conduct: March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506 at 514 per Mason CJ with whom Toohey J and Gaudron J agreed. For this proposition the Chief Justice in March v Stramare cited Duyvelshaff v Cathcart & Ritchie Ltd (1973) 47 ALJR 410 at 417 per Gibbs J; Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez (1976) 50 ALJR 720 at 724; Bonnington Castings at 620; and McGhee at 4, 6, 8 and 12. See also the use of the phrase ""caused or causally contributed to"" in Norton Australia Pty Ltd v Streets Ice Cream Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 61; 120 CLR 635 at 643 per Barwick CJ. Mason CJ's comments in March v Stramare were made in the context of his Honour's discussion of concurrent or successive tortious acts each amounting to a cause and not in the context of materially increasing the risk of the harm that eventuates. 

33The passage from the judgment of Gibbs J in Duyvelshaff at 417, cited by Mason CJ was as follows: 

""The general principle is clear, that the plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the breach of duty caused or materially contributed to his injury: Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw [1956] AC 613, at 620; McWilliams v Sir William Arrol & Co Ltd [1962] 1 WLR 295; Wigley v British Vinegars Ltd , supra. This means that 'it is for the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities both that the safety measures would have been effective and that the injured person would have made use of them had they been available': Wigley v British Vinegars Ltd ([1964] AC, at 325) In some cases the fact that the employer is in breach of his statutory duty may itself provide some prima facie evidence of a causal connexion between the breach and the subsequent damage: McWilliams v Sir William Arrol & Co Ltd ([1962] 1 WLR, at 302) or, in other words, 'the breach of duty coupled with an accident of the kind that might thereby be caused is enough to justify an inference, in the absence of any sufficient reason to the contrary, that in fact the accident did occur owing to the act or omission amounting to the breach of statutory duty': Betts v Whittingslowe (1945) 71 CLR 637, at 649. Nevertheless, the burden of proving the causal connexion between the breach and the damage remains on the plaintiff."" 

34I will return to Betts v Whittingslowe [1945] HCA 31; 71 CLR 637 shortly . The above passage, however, is not authority for the proposition that tortiously increasing the risk of harm suffices for causation of harm. Nor is the reference by Mason CJ to his Honour's own reasons in Tubemakers . In that case, there was a contest about the condition of the plaintiff's hand being attributable to the injury suffered by the plaintiff caused by the defendant's negligence. Mason J (as his Honour then was) said at 724: 

""In my opinion, this evidence left it open to the jury to infer that on the probabilities the injury caused or materially contributed to the occurrence of the condition. In drawing such an inference the jury was entitled to have regard, in addition to the matters referred to by Dr Sweeney in his evidence, to other significant circumstances: (a) that before the accident the respondent had suffered no disability in his right hand; (b) that the condition made its appearance shortly after the accident; and (c) that no alternative cause was established or indeed suggested in evidence. The combination of these circumstances, taken together with Dr Sweeney's evidence, provided in my opinion a sufficient basis from which the jury could draw an inference favourable to the respondent. 

Reaching this conclusion involves no departure from the ordinary onus of proof which rests upon a plaintiff to establish on the probabilities that a medical condition or disability from which he suffers is ""caused or materially contributed to"" by the defendant's wrongful conduct ( Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw [ 1956] AC 613 at 620; at 618, per Lord Reid). Consequently, as the decision in that case demonstrates, the plaintiff will fail if all that he can show is that his disability might have been so caused (see also St George Club Ltd v Hines ( 1961) 35 ALJR 106 at 107; [1962] ALR 39 at 41, where it was pointed out that mere proof of default followed by injury does not show that the default caused the injury)."" 

Mason J (in Tubemakers ) then referred to passages in the reasons of Taylor J in Australian Iron and Steel Ltd v Connell [1959] HCA 54; 102 CLR 522 at 531-532 and 532-533 and Dixon J in Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst [1940] HCA 45; 64 CLR 538 at 569 as elaborating ""with varying degrees of emphasis the general onus which lies upon the plaintiff on an issue of causation where the issue lies outside the realm of common knowledge and experience and falls to be determined by reference to expert medical evidence"". 

35Australian Iron and Steel was a case in which the respondent's husband collapsed and died whilst walking from home to the train station on his way to work. A claim was made under the workers' compensation legislation. Taylor J considered the relationship between exertion and the injury and said the following at the above-cited pages: 

""... the question is not whether exertion may have been a factor in causing death but whether it is probable that it was, and this must fail ( sic ) to be determined by the evidence in the case. No doubt cases have arisen and will continue to arise where the character and sequence of events may strongly suggest that exertion played a material part in bringing about death (cf Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst (1940) 64 CLR 538). But this is not such a case and it is necessary to remember that it is for the applicant to make out a case and that liability is not established merely by proving that exertion may have been a material factor. 

... 

No doubt we are permitted to know that coronary disease is the cause of many deaths and that sometimes death occurs when the victim is at rest. At other times it occurs whilst he is engaged in some activity which calls for a degree of exertion. In the latter category there will, doubtless, be found cases where exertion was a factor contributing to death whilst in other cases the connexion between the exertion and the death will be no more than temporal. Whether there is a causal, as opposed to a merely temporal, connexion may possibly appear, sometimes, from a significant sequence of events. At other times it may be established by more precise evidence but such a connexion must be shown by a balance of evidence in order to establish liability."" 

36In Forst , Dixon J had said at the above-cited page: 

""... I think that upon a question of fact of a medical or scientific description, a court can only say that the burden of proof has not been discharged where, upon the evidence, it appears that the present state of knowledge does not admit of an affirmative answer and that competent and trustworthy expert opinion regards an affirmative answer as lacking justification, either as a probable inference or as an accepted hypothesis."" 

37None of these passages supports a proposition of causation by increased risk. Indeed, they are to the contrary, unless the increased risk is part of a body of evidence from which it can be legitimately inferred on the balance of probabilities that the tortious act caused or materially contributed to the injury. 

38In Bonnington Castings silica dust that caused the pursuer's pneumoconiosis came from two sources in his employer's factory: ""innocent"" dust from the pneumatic hammer at which he worked in respect of which no known practical method of extracting or preventing dust was available; and ""guilty"" dust from swing grinders that were fitted with an extraction device which was negligently not kept free from obstruction. The medical evidence permitted the conclusion that pneumoconiosis was caused by the gradual accumulation of silica dust inhaled (guilty and innocent dust together). The guilty dust being material in its contribution to the disease, causation was proved at 618 per Viscount Simonds, agreeing with Lord Reid, 620-623 per Lord Reid, 623-624 per Lord Tucker and 625-626 per Lord Keith of Avonholm. The ""guilty"" dust as part of an accumulation was a materially contributing factor or cause. See in particular Lord Reid at 620-621. Mason J in Tubemakers and Mason CJ in March v Stramare specifically referred to Lord Reid's speech in Bonnington Castings at 620, where his Lordship said the following: 

""It would seem obvious in principle that a pursuer or plaintiff must prove not only negligence or breach of duty but also that such fault caused or materially contributed to his injury, and there is ample authority for that proposition both in Scotland and in England. 

... 

... the employee must in all cases prove his case by the ordinary standard of proof in civil actions: he must make it appear at least that on a balance of probabilities the breach of duty caused or materially contributed to his injury."" 

39None of these passages supports a proposition of proof of causation by increased risk. 

The question of onus of proof 

40Before dealing with McGhee , it is necessary to say something about Betts v Whittingslowe and the question of onus of proof. All evidence is of course weighed according to the proof which it is in the power of one side to have produced and in the power of the other to have contradicted: Blatch v Archer (1774) 1 Cowp 63 at 65; 98 ER 969 at 970. The practical approach to the drawing of inferences and conclusions from available evidence that is taken by the courts can be illustrated by many cases: Hollis v Young [1909] 1 KB 629; Dunlop Holdings Ltd's Application [1979] RPC 523 at 544; Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks [1957] HCA 28; 97 CLR 367 at 371-372; Parker v Paton (1941) 41 SR (NSW) 237 at 243; and J D Heydon Cross on Evidence (8 th Ed 2010) at 304 [7160] fn 123 and cases and references there cited. Thus, ""in considering the amount of evidence necessary to shift the burden of proof, the Court has regard to the opportunities of knowledge with respect to the fact to be proved which may be possessed by the parties respectively"": J F Stephen, A Digest of the Law of Evidence (5 th Ed 1887) at 11 cited in Cullen v Welsbach Light Company of Australasia Ltd [1907] HCA 3; 4 CLR 990 at 1013-1014. 

41The circumstances in which the law will provide for rules of shifting onuses or rules of evidence or rules of substantive law that affect proof is, in part, a matter of legal policy. There is a variety of circumstances in which the law provides either forensically or substantively for a shift in onus. The fact that the wrongful conduct has itself made proof difficult may found a rule about who bears the relevant onus. In transport cases, shifting evidential onuses are sometimes employed to disentangle causation issues by reference to capacity for proof: for example in deviation cases and cases of cargo damage under bills of lading where a largely internationally accepted regime of onus shifting exists. Bailment is a relationship under which the onus lies upon the defendant upon proof of the damage to, or non-return of, goods bailed. The present circumstances, however, do not amount to a recognised category of shifted onus. Personal injury is asserted to be caused, or materially contributed to, by the defendant's wrong. The task of the plaintiff is to prove such on the balance of probabilities. This involves direct evidence or inference that must amount to more than conflicting inferences of equal degree or probability such that any choice is conjecture. The conclusion must be affirmatively drawn: Holloway v McFeeters [1956] HCA 25; 94 CLR 470 at 480-481; Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; 101 CLR 298 at 305; and Luxton v Vines [1952] HCA 19; 85 CLR 352 at 358-359. Common experience and expert evidence will be relevant, and the former may provide the foundation for the inference when the latter cannot: Forst at 563-564; and EMI (Australia) Ltd v Bes [1970] 2 NSWR 238 at 242, unless the expert evidence regards an affirmative inference as lacking justification: Forst at 569; and Tubemakers at 724; cf Australian Iron and Steel v Connell at 535-536 per Menzies J. 

42The notion of ""balance of probabilities"" does not import a conclusion of mathematical or mechanical precision: Jones v Sutherland Shire Council [1979] 2 NSWLR 206 at 227-228 per Mahoney JA; and Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262 at 275-278 [80]-[98]. 

43It is in this context of proof of facts that the question of the defendant's wrongful conduct materially increasing the risk of the relevant harm must be assessed. In Betts v Whittingslowe at 649, Dixon J said the following: 

""It is not necessary to inquire whether their Lordships meant more than that the breach of duty coupled with an accident of the kind that might thereby be caused is enough to justify an inference, in the absence of any sufficient reason to the contrary, that in fact the accident did occur owing to the act or omission amounting to the breach of statutory duty. 

In the circumstances of this case that proposition is enough. For, in my opinion, the facts warrant no other inference inconsistent with liability on the part of the defendant."" (Emphasis added.) 

44Dixon J was discussing the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Vyner v Waldenberg Brothers Ltd [1946] 1 KB 50, in which, in the context of factories and shops legislation, the Court (Scott LJ, Mackinnon LJ and Morton LJ) had said at 55: 

""If there is a definite breach of a safety provision imposed on the occupier of a factory, and a workman is injured in a way which could result from the breach, the onus of proof shifts on to the employer to show that the breach was not the cause. We think that that principle lies at the very basis of statutory rules of absolute duty."" (Emphasis added.) 

45Dixon J was using the conjunction of breach and the occurrence of the harm as part of the fact finding process of drawing the relevant inference, not as a basis for a shift of onus that can be seen in Vyner. ( Vyner , it should be noted, was expressly over-ruled in Bonnington Castings .) That is how Betts v Whittingslowe has been interpreted by the High Court in Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Royal [2008] HCA 19; 82 ALJR 870 at 878 [31] per Gummow J, Hayne J and Heydon J and 897 [143] per Kiefel J and by this Court and other intermediate courts of appeal in Australia: Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504 at 556 [254] and 557 [256] (and the cases there cited); and Flounders v Millar [2007] NSWCA 238 at [4]-[38]; cf John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Canny [1981] HCA 52; 148 CLR 218 at 242 in a context of statutory duty. It should be noted, however, that there are dicta inconsistent with this approach in the High Court: Bennett v Minister of Community Welfare [1992] HCA 27; 176 CLR 408 at 420-421 per Gaudron J; Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55; 195 CLR 232 at 238-239 per Gaudron J, 257-259 per Gummow J and 273 per Kirby J; and Naxakis v Western General Hospital [1999] HCA 22; 197 CLR 269 at 279. It must be recognised, however, when one is assessing Gummow J's view in Chappel v Hart (in contrast to that in Royal ) that the Court in Chappel v Hart (and Bennett ) was dealing with a duty to warn: see the discussion in Elbourne v Gibbs [2006] NSWCA 127 at [59]-[75] per Ipp JA and North Sydney Council v Binks [2007] NSWCA 245 at [93] per Basten JA. In this respect, the character of the duty and its relationship with the required causal connection may be seen to highlight the relevance of the governing rule of responsibility in the inquiry: Environment Agency v Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd [1998] UKHL 5; [1999] 2 AC 22 at 29. Further, one view of Gummow J's position in Chappel v Hart may be that his Honour was doing no more than drawing an inference in an orthodox manner (if I may respectfully put it that way) in the absence of other evidence. 

46The need for an affirmative inference of the above character is inconsistent with the fundamental legal proposition founding the appellant's fourth complaint. Also inconsistent with it are the decisions in this Court in Bendix Mintex Pty Ltd v Barnes (1997) 42 NSWLR 307 at 315-316 per Mason P and 339 per Beazley JA; TC by his Tutor Sabatino v State of New South Wales [2001] NSWCA 380 at [59]; Seltsam at 278-280 [102]-[120] per Spigelman CJ and at 306 [268] per Davies AJA; and Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76 at [254]. Further, the necessary relationship between liability for increase in risk and loss of a chance places the appellant's fundamental proposition in conflict with the High Court's decision in Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; 240 CLR 537. 

McGhee 

47It is necessary to deal with McGhee , not least because of the changed interpretation of the case by the House of Lords and United Kingdom Supreme Court. In McGhee , the pursuer who worked in a brickworks contracted dermatitis. He was usually employed in emptying pipe kilns, but shortly before he felt excessive irritation of the skin he had been sent to empty brick kilns where work was hotter and dustier. Shortly thereafter, he went off work suffering dermatitis. The breach of duty relied upon (and admitted) was not providing washing facilities after finishing work in the brick kilns. The medical evidence was to the effect that the dermatitis was caused by repeated minute abrasions of the outer skin followed by some damage to underlying cells, of a kind not scientifically understood. Profuse sweating over time softened the skin and made it easily injured. Dust would adhere to the skin in the kiln and exertion would cause abrasion. Washing was the only practical way of removing the danger. His bicycling home caked with sweat and dust would only exacerbate the position. Enough, however, was known about the disease to enable a conclusion that it was not like pneumoconiosis in that it was not caused by all the dust and sweat and exertion. However, it was clear that not providing showers materially increased the risk of contracting dermatitis. The House of Lords found for the pursuer. 

48Two interpretations have been placed on the case. The first is reflected in Lord Bridge's analysis (adopted by all members of the House) in Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority [1988] AC 1074 that McGhee did not stand for any principle that the onus of proof was reversed or that material increase in risk alone was sufficient. McGhee was said to be (with the exception of Lord Wilberforce's opinion) an example of a robust and pragmatic approach to inferential fact finding of material contribution. This had been also how the House of Lords had interpreted it in Kay v Ayrshire and Arran Health Board [1987] 2 All ER 417. This was also the view of Lord Hutton in Fairchild. This interpretation was also the foundation of Bendix and Seltsam . The second interpretation is reflected in the analysis of Lord Bingham, Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger in Fairchild that in circumstances such as McGhee either a material increase in risk is an adequate ""causal"" link or no relevant distinction was to be drawn between materially increasing the risk and materially contributing to (that is causing) the injury. This interpretation of McGhee also founds the United Kingdom Supreme Court's decision in Sienkiewicz , to the extent that that decision stands as support for the appellant's fundamental proposition. 

49There are a number of references in the High Court to McGhee : Bennett at 420-421 per Gaudron J; March v Stramare at 514 and 516 per Mason CJ; Chappel v Hart at 273-274 [93] per Kirby J; RTA v Royal at (2008) 82 ALJR 870, 888-889 [94] per Kirby J and 897-898 [143] per Kiefel J; Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; 240 CLR 111 at 123 [12]; and Tabet v Gett at 558 [40] per Gummow ACJ and 588 [149] per Kiefel J. 

50The issues of the relationship between breach and causation and between causing an increase in risk, material contribution and onus of proof were expressly left open in Bennett at 416, and were expressly disavowed by the plaintiff/respondent in Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis see 123 [12]; nor were the points taken in the High Court in Tabet v Gett . 

51The importance of the question left open by Mason CJ, Deane J and Toohey J in Bennett at 416 (""the question whether a failure to take steps which would bring about a material reduction of the risk amounts to a material contribution to the injury"") can be seen from the references by Mason CJ in March v Stramare at 514 to McGhee at 4, 6, 8 and 12 as support for the law's recognition of ""material contribution"" as an element of causation. It can be accepted that the re-interpretation of McGhee by reference to what is at these pages has some force. Lord Reid at 4-5, Lord Wilberforce at 6, Lord Simon of Glaisdale at 8 and Lord Salmon at 12 appear to found their reasoning on material increase in risk founding the causal link in cases where proof of more is otherwise not possible. (I express no concluded view on the question of the proper interpretation or understanding of McGhee .) The leaving open of the consideration of the question in Bennett can be taken as a recognition that the references in March v Stramare at 514 to the pages of McGhee to which I have referred did not already establish a proposition which is consistent with the re-interpretation of McGhee in Fairchild and later cases. This is particularly the case given the limited purpose of the citation of McGhee in March v Stramare at 514. 

52Given the state of the law otherwise to which I have referred, a re-analysis of the cases on causation by reference to the interpretation of the speeches in McGhee in accordance with the views of the House of Lords and Supreme Court in Fairchild, Barker v Corus and Sienkiewicz awaits the attention of the High Court. In my view, it is not open to this Court to accept the appellant's fundamental proposition underpinning her fourth complaint. This is so certainly in the absence of a direct attack in this Court on cases such as Bendix and Seltsam as plainly wrong. 

Conclusion 

53The law is to be understood as requiring that, in a tortious claim such as this, a plaintiff must prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant's wrong caused or materially contributed to his or her loss, not just that the defendant's wrong materially increased the risk of such harm and that medical science does not permit any further proof. As the High Court said in St George Club v Hines Ltd (1961) 35 ALJR 106 at 107: 

""In an action at law a plaintiff does not prove his case merely by stating that it was possible that his injury was caused by the defendant's default."" 

Stamoulis 

54It is necessary to deal with Stamoulis , which was relied on by the appellant to found the proposition. Both Hodgson JA and Basten JA have discussed it. The reasons of Ipp JA (with whom Beazley JA, a member of the bench in Gett v Tabet , agreed), the additional comments of Beazley JA and the reasons of Giles JA are all founded on an expression of legal principle which is consistent with authorities that I have discussed and which is inconsistent with the appellant's fundamental proposition underpinning her fourth complaint: [2009] NSWCA 153 at [29]-[30], [37] and most importantly [122]-[127] and [134]-[141]. Whether or not the evidence in Stamoulis was sufficient to enable the inference of cause or material contribution to be drawn need not be analysed. It was a factual conclusion reached by their Honours. The comments of Spigelman CJ in Seltsam at 275 [84] and Lord Macmillan in Jones v Great Western Railway Co (1930) 144 LT 194 at 202 as to the difficulty in identifying the dividing line between inference and conjecture are relevant in this respect. More importantly for present purposes, the legal principle expressed by all three judges was in accordance with the views that I have expressed above that are inconsistent with the appellant's fundamental proposition underpinning her fourth complaint. 

55The above does not deal with the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), s 5D, which provision is irrelevant to proceedings (such as this) brought under the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 (NSW), s 11: see the Civil Liability Act , s 3B(1)(b). 

56HODGSON JA : I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA, and I agree substantially with his reasons. I would add the following reasons of my own. 

57The table prepared by the primary judge and set out in Basten JA's judgment suggests that if, in a case where a person has both smoked and been exposed to asbestos, it is possible that cancer has been caused either by the smoking alone or by the asbestos alone or by the synergistic effects of the two, the statistics could not support a finding on the balance of probabilities that the asbestos was a substantial contributing cause, operating either alone or in combination with the smoking. 

58However, if it had been established that, where a person has both smoked and been exposed to asbestos, the two operated synergistically (either in all cases, or in the particular case of Mr Evans) and that the contribution of the asbestos was significant (at least in the case of Mr Evans), then this could have supported a finding that the asbestos was a substantial contributing cause of the cancer suffered by Mr Evans. It might however have then been necessary to deduct from any damages a sum reflecting the chance that cancer would have developed without the exposure to asbestos; although it appears that in this case such a deduction may have been quite small, having regard to the figure of ten percent mentioned in par [88] in Basten JA's judgment. 

59This approach seems consistent both with Sydney South West Area Health Service v Stamoulis [2009] NSWCA 153 and Amaca Pty Limited v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; (2010) 240 CLR 111. 

60In Stamoulis , a carcinoma of the plaintiff's left breast metastasised into her lungs and brain. The plaintiff brought a claim against two radiologists who examined a mammogram taken in March 2006, but did not recommend further investigation. The plaintiff was diagnosed as having cancer as a result of a further mammogram in January 2007. The evidence was that, had the tumour been detected and treated in March 2006, the plaintiff would have had a 62 percent chance of not experiencing metastasis; but in the event, she had a lesser 58 percent chance of not experiencing metastasis. The Court of Appeal held that that would have been sufficient to establish causation. 

61As pointed out by Basten JA, it may be questioned whether Stamoulis is consistent with Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; (2010) 240 CLR 537. At best for the appellant, it would have to be understood on the basis that what came home was a materially increased risk (increased by ten percent from 38 percent to 42 percent), which was an indivisible whole, incapable of being divided into separate components of a ""base"" risk of 38 percent and an increase to this risk of four percent. However, had the plaintiff been otherwise successful, this analysis would suggest that it would then have been necessary to make a deduction from any verdict referable to the 38 percent chance that metastasis would have occurred in any event: cf Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20; (1990) 169 CLR 638. 

62In Ellis , the analysis was not applicable, because it was not established that smoking and cancer must work together, or that they must have worked together in that particular case: see Ellis at [53]-[54]. In my opinion, it is clear that the High Court was not satisfied that smoking and asbestos had in fact worked together in that case. 

63The primary contention of the appellant was that the evidence in this case was different from that in Ellis ; and that the evidence did establish that smoking and asbestos had worked together synergistically in this case. It was submitted for the appellant that the primary judge erred in law in rejecting that contention, in the following paragraphs of his judgment: 

149. I am persuaded that asbestos and cigarette smoking may act in combination in contributing to the development of lung cancer. 

150. I am not persuaded that in all cases, and in particular in this case of Mr Evans, that the contribution of asbestos must have occurred, or if it did, that the contribution was material. 

151. First, because both Professor Breslin and Professor Tattersall, while accepting the theory, dismissed the contribution of asbestos in Mr Evans' case because of its relative insignificance. I accept that a contribution may be material although it is minor but I believe that, in context, the opinions of both medical experts are to the effect that the contribution was not minor but insignificant, that is to say, immaterial. 

152. Secondly, because Dr Leigh concedes that in a particular case the contribution of asbestos may play a very small part , and that he could not say that, more probably than not, Mr Evans would not have contracted his cancer in the absence of the asbestos exposure. 

153. Thirdly, because epidemiological studies predict that among the class of persons who share Mr Evans' smoking history, the greatest number of those who contract lung cancer after exposure to an equivalent asbestos fibre burden are persons who would have contracted the disease in any event. 

154. Fourthly, because, even if asbestos and smoking combined causally in the development of lung cancers in all cases, the contribution of asbestos to the development of lung cancer in smokers may take the form of hastening the development of the cancer. That would reconcile the certainty of epidemiological prediction that a certain number of lung cancers will develop in smokers in any event, with the plausible biological theory that the additional risk factor of asbestos exposure will contribute to that inevitable development by way of acceleration. 

64It was also submitted that what was said in par [151] was inconsistent with a statement in par [177] of the judgment that the presence of diffuse pleural thickening in Mr Evans' lungs indicated ""significant asbestos exposure"". 

65I think there is force in some of the criticisms of those paragraphs. If it had been proved that smoking and asbestos worked synergistically in the case of Mr Evans, and if it had also been proved that the contribution of the smoking to this synergistic working was significant, then it would not matter that it had not been proved that ""Mr Evans would not have contracted his cancer in the absence of the asbestos exposure"" (par [152]). Further, contrary to what is suggested in par [154], acceleration of development of something that would have happened later could support a claim for damages; although that kind of claim was never made in this case. 

66However, crucially in par [150], the primary judge was not persuaded that in all cases or in this case the contribution of asbestos must have occurred in combination with that of smoking (and I take it that this means he was not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that it did so in this case). Further, in par [151], the primary judge indicated lack of satisfaction that any contribution of the asbestos was significant. I do not see any inconsistency of this with par [177]: exposure to asbestos could be significant, yet a judgment could be made that its contribution to the causation of cancer in a heavy smoker was not significant. 

67I do not think those views of the primary judge were vitiated by any of the errors in pars [152] or [154]. This means that neither of the thresholds suggested by my earlier analysis was passed: it was not shown that the contribution of asbestos was indivisible from that of the smoking, and it was also not shown that this contribution was significant. 

68BASTEN JA : Most disputes which reach tribunals and courts turn not on some uncertainty as to the correct legal principle to be applied, but on the facts. Courts do not act upon facts in some absolute sense, but only decide what, on the evidence before them, is (in a civil case) probably true. In other areas of social activity, including scientific investigation, it is unusual to treat as objectively true something of which all that can be said is that it is more probably true than untrue. That is a circumstance with which courts must grapple in cases where critical evidence comes from experts involved in scientific investigation. This case involved evidence from specialists in epidemiology, pathology, thoracic medicine, other medical specialties and from industrial hygienists, many of whom were eminent in their fields. 

69The issue in dispute was whether the lung cancer contracted by the late Mr Evans was caused by his exposure to asbestos dust in circumstances imposing responsibility on either or both of the respondents. The first respondent (Queanbeyan City Council) was Mr Evans' employer from 1975-1990; the second respondent (Amaca Pty Ltd) was an important manufacturer of asbestos building products through much of Mr Evans' working life. If it had been shown that Mr Evans' lung cancer was caused by exposure to asbestos, further questions would have arisen as to the responsibility of each of the respondents for such exposure. Thus, liability in negligence would require those respondents to have failed to exercise reasonable care to protect Mr Evans from exposure to asbestos dust as a worker, or as a user of asbestos products. These latter questions did not arise in the present case because the appellant failed at the first hurdle: Judge Curtis, sitting in the Dust Diseases Tribunal, was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Evans' lung cancer was caused by exposure to asbestos: Evans v Queanbeyan City Council [2010] NSWDDT 7. Mr Evans' widow appeals against that decision. 

70Tribunals are usually established to improve access to justice, especially for the less well-off members of the community, who may have small claims which do not justify the expenditure of large sums of money. In other cases, such as the Dust Diseases Tribunal, an alternative to the ordinary civil courts may be established with flexible procedures to permit speedy determination of claims of persons possibly suffering from a terminal illness. Despite the procedures of civil courts having the overriding purpose of facilitating the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in dispute, their ability to do so is relative. Further, injustice may be reduced, but expense and delay increased, by the provision of general rights of appeal from tribunals. To that end, the Dust Diseases Tribunal (in common with many other statutory tribunals) is not subject to appeals by way of rehearing. Its decisions are subject to judicial review, but a dissatisfied party's right of appeal is limited to ""a decision of the Tribunal in point of law or on a question as to the admission or rejection of evidence"": Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 (NSW) (""the Tribunal Act ""), s 32(1). To the extent that either party is dissatisfied with a decision of the Tribunal which cannot be described as being ""in point of law"" (leaving to one side questions of evidence) the result may be to prefer finality and expedition over the ""just"" outcome, always assuming that a full right of appeal is apt to promote the just resolution of disputes. 

71It is natural for judges to seek to promote just outcomes. Where an appellate court perceives that an injustice has been suffered, due to erroneous fact-finding, there is a tendency to press the limits of the statutory right of appeal to allow the injustice to be remedied. Fidelity to the statutory language may, however, preclude intervention. 

72One form of injustice is to fail to achieve similar results in like cases. That can occur when there is evidence to support a decision either way in two cases, the judge in the first case preferring the evidence tending in one direction, whereas the judge in the second case prefers the other evidence. One claimant may succeed and the other fail in circumstances where their circumstances and the expert evidence is not materially different. The statutory right of appeal would not permit interference in either case. As will be explained below, this case illustrates an aspect of that paradox. 

Nature of case in Tribunal 
73Mr Evans was a tolerably heavy smoker for a considerable period of time. He commenced smoking in about 1941, at 14 or 15 years of age, and continued smoking until 1990. The primary judge held that Mr Evans smoked between 20 and 35 cigarettes a day for approximately 40 years: at [16]. Over roughly the same period, he suffered occupational exposure to asbestos dust of variable intensity, depending upon the work he was undertaking at the relevant time. A quantitative assessment of such exposure is extraordinarily difficult, with any degree of accuracy. It depends on anecdotal evidence as to the occasions of exposure, the periods of exposure on each occasion and the levels of dust from time to time. Precision is impossible. Nevertheless, techniques have been devised to permit the calculation of total exposure measured as fibres/ml/years. 

74Exposure to asbestos dust can give rise to a number of conditions, including asbestosis, asbestos related pleural diseases, lung cancer and mesothelioma. This case is concerned with lung cancer. Although it is not presently possible for medical science to say whether a particular instance of lung cancer is caused by exposure to asbestos or not, knowledge supports a correlation between the level of exposure and the occurrence of that disease. Accordingly, establishing Mr Evans' level of exposure, to the extent that that could be done, was a relevant factual inquiry. His Honour found that Mr Evans had a total exposure over the whole of his working life of 21.9 fibre/ml/years: at [62]. The apparent level of precision is misleading - his Honour did not suggest otherwise: rather, he ""recognised the difficulty of reconstruction and attempted to make generous assumptions as to his exposure"": at [167]. He accepted that this was a finding of ""significant asbestos exposure"": at [168]. 

75Because Mr Evans was not able to demonstrate, by medical evidence, the cause of his particular disease, it was, arguably, necessary for him to rely upon epidemiology. Epidemiology involves a statistical analysis of various populations. Although it too may produce calculations resulting in precise figures, the position is often misleading and the figures are no more accurate than the underlying source material. The evidence was not expressed in terms of degree of certainty or range of possible error, referrable to the basic data. 

76Broadly speaking, epidemiology can be used in two quite different ways. One is to calculate the risk of disease in a population, for example of persons who are exposed to asbestos dust or smoke cigarettes. This exercise is of relatively limited significance for present purposes, except to show that even amongst heavy smokers, or those who have significant asbestos exposure, the incidence of lung cancer is relatively low. The second kind of exercise, relied upon in the present case, may take a population with a particular disease and estimate the likelihood that in any particular case the disease resulted from one of a number of causes. Thus, with a particular cohort or population of lung cancer sufferers, tables can be produced indicating the ""relative risk"" that a particular cancer arose from a particular cause where the causes which are not sought to be investigated are broadly lumped together as ""background risk"" and accorded the numerical value of 1. When the relative risk in respect of a particular cause reaches 2, it can be said that any particular cancer suffered by a person subjected to that cause is as likely to have resulted from that cause as from the background risk. Alternatively, the cohort can be divided in percentage terms into the various causes. Adopting the latter approach, the primary judge prepared a table in which the background incidence of lung cancers was 100 in a given population and then showing the percentages attributable to smoking, asbestos and the combined effect of smoking and asbestos exposure, reflecting Mr Evans' circumstances: at [140].

Additional cancers attributable to the synergistic effect of smoking and asbestos exposure

417

27%


Total

1530

100%

77These figures reflected exposures in the range of those experienced by Mr Evans. The table, taken at face value, demonstrated two critical matters. The first was that the total of all of the cancers attributable in some measure to asbestos exposure amounted to 30% of the cohort, whereas those attributable solely to smoking constituted 63% of the cohort. That is, in respect of any individual cancer afflicting a person who both smoked and was subjected to asbestos dust, there was a one-in-three chance that asbestos was in some part responsible and a two-in-three chance that it was attributable to smoking alone. On those figures, it could not be said of any individual cancer that it was more probably than not attributable, even in part, to asbestos exposure. If that were the only relevant material, or if it were material, taken alone, upon which the primary judge was entitled to rely, and did rely, the appeal must fail. 

78The second matter illustrated by the table is that there is a ""synergistic effect"" in respect of smoking and exposure to asbestos dust. The precise mechanism by which this effect works is not scientifically established. It may be hypothesised that there is a biological reaction taking place in the lung, although the reaction is not presently understood. 

A universal ""synergistic effect""? 
79Of critical importance for the appellant's case was the evidence of Dr James Leigh, who has a distinguished record in research and clinical work, broadly in the area of thoracic medicine, but with a particular emphasis on asbestos-related disease and epidemiology. A critical passage at page 6 in the report of 22 July 2009 prepared by Dr Leigh, set out by the primary judge at [66], was in the following terms: 

""While the precise mechanism of interaction between asbestos and tobacco smoke in causing lung cancer is not known, it is not possible in my view to separate their effects on the individual case when both have acted, as they must do to some extent from a purely physico-chemical point of view, and it is thus more probable than not, that in this situation, the lung cancer was the singular result of the two factors acting together."" 

80In a passage from his oral evidence, also set out by the primary judge, Dr Leigh, after being referred to two published papers, stated (Tcpt, 25/03/10, p 91(30)): 

""They certainly strengthen my opinion that if both agents are present then both are acting biologically in producing either tumours or the early stages of carcinogenesis in the form of mutations. They actually demonstrate a more than additive interaction between the tobacco agent and the asbestos, in fact, in a biological sense as opposed to [an] epidemiologic sense."" 

81The appellant argued that this evidence of a biological effect allowed the trial judge to be satisfied that asbestos, on the probabilities, contributed to Mr Evans' lung cancer. That is, where both agents were present, a reaction will usually occur, meaning that both would contribute to any instance of lung cancer. In legal terms, causation was thus established. On this approach, it was not necessary to go to the epidemiology, which provided no conclusion as to the role of asbestos in a particular case. Curtis J, did not, however, accept this submission. Rather, he accepted the evidence of Dr Berry, the primary epidemiologist, that such a conclusion was inconsistent with the epidemiology, which, although it showed the synergistic effect of the two agents in combination, did not suggest that the synergistic effect operated in all cases, indeed the contrary. In evidence accepted by the primary judge, Dr Berry said of the biological modelling, ""that if it did not agree with the epidemiological data it must be incorrect"": at [194]. 

82The synergistic effect is not merely a theory of physical or chemical inter-reaction of the two agents in a person's lung. Nor is it, subject to an argument addressed below, an effect which can be identified in a particular individual. It is, his Honour found, capable of assessment in epidemiological terms. Thus, he stated at [131]: 

""There is a synergistic effect between asbestos and smoking in the causation of lung cancer so that the combined effect of asbestos exposure and smoking on the risk is approximately multiplicative. The effect of the synergy can be given mathematical form by multiplying together the relative risks of smoking and asbestos and deducting the sum of those risks."" 

Double agent effects in a particular case 
83The primary judge was entitled to accept Dr Berry's evidence and hence reject, as inconsistent with the epidemiology, the hypothesis that smoking and asbestos work together in all (or more than 50% of) cases. That is not to say that the hypothesis is erroneous: rather, it is to say that the trial judge was not satisfied that it was probably correct. If, as Dr Leigh explained, and his Honour accepted, there is a synergistic effect, it is obviously important to understand how the mechanism works, so that it will be possible to say whether it must operate in all cases, or only in some, and if some, in more or less than half. The evidence was contentious in this respect. The epidemiology demonstrated that, after taking into account the numbers of persons who would suffer from lung cancer if exposed to asbestos or to cigarette smoke at certain levels , there will be more who suffer as a result of exposure to both agents. For the purposes of the appellant's case, the trial judge had to be satisfied that, in more than half the cases of double exposure, including people who would have suffered from lung cancer as a result of smoking alone, the exposure to asbestos nevertheless contributed. 

84One question may be whether it would sufficient to show a universal contribution in circumstances where it could not be shown that the tortious agent (asbestos exposure) resulted in an earlier contraction of the disease, or a more serious disease. If, for example, both were found to be contributing causes, but that the injured worker would have suffered from lung cancer as a result of his or her smoking in any event, the analysis of the hypothetical circumstances required in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20; 169 CLR 638 would operate. Thus, if the tortious event could be shown to have led to an injury two years earlier than it would have been suffered absent the tortious event, the damages would be limited to the suffering inflicted over that period. But if the damage would not have occurred earlier, nor been more intense, causation may have been proved, but no loss attributable to the tortious exposure. These issues do not arise in the present case. 

Application of 'but for' test 
85The next point concerns remarks by his Honour which appear to apply the so-called ""but for"" test. Thus, at [81], his Honour stated: 

""Notwithstanding his opinion that both smoking and asbestos contributed to the development of Mr Evans' lung cancer, Dr Leigh was unable to say that, more probably than not, Mr Evans would not have contracted the cancer in the absence of the asbestos exposure."" 

86Taken in isolation, that passage might indicate the application of a wrong test. As explained by Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Malec , the issue in that appeal concerned ""the valuation of a plaintiff's damage, caused by the tortious conduct of the defendant, after it is found that it is more likely than not that the damage would have occurred in any event as the result of conditions or events for which the defendant is not legally responsible"": at 640. Causation of injury and assessment of loss are separate exercises. 

87The questioning upon which the primary judge relied in making the statement set out above (at Tcpt, 84(29) and 86(41)) involved the same latent ambiguity as his statement. Thus, in the latter passage, his Honour asked: 

""Q. Paragraph 65 of Ellis the High Court, Doctor, said it was not shown to be more probable than not that asbestos was the cause of [or?] a necessary condition for his cancer. Are you able to express an opinion whether or not Mr Evans would have contracted cancer without the asbestos. 
A - Yes, he could've. 

Q. Are you able to say whether it's more probable than not, that is can you know more probably than not that he would or would not have contracted the cancer without the asbestos. 
A - Well, it would depend on what the court accepts as to the relative exposures. So I can't really answer that in this particular case."" 

88The first problem with this exchange was the ambiguity as to whether the witness was being asked to assume that Mr Evans contracted cancer. If the hypothetical were addressed before he contracted cancer, relying upon an unspecified level of cigarette smoking but no exposure to asbestos, the chance of him contracting cancer would have been well below 50%, particularly as one of the circumstances was that he had ceased smoking some years before he contracted cancer. However, it cannot have been assumed that he did contract cancer, or the question would have been meaningless. (The parties accepted that less than 10% of people who smoked as heavily as Mr Evans contract lung cancer.) 

89Secondly, the context of the question requires reference to the judgment of the High Court in Amaca Pty Ltd v Ellis [2010] HCA 5; 240 CLR 111 at [65]. The context in which this passage arose needs to be identified. Like the present case, Amaca v Ellis involved a smoker exposed to asbestos dust. Importantly, the case came before the High Court following an appeal from a trial court to the Court of Appeal of Western Australia. The appeal was by way of rehearing and involved a review of the evidence: it was not limited to identification of legal error on the part of the primary judge. In that context, the High Court reviewed evidence given by Dr Leigh in that case. Their Honours stated: 

""[33] Dr Leigh gave evidence about research into the possible biological mechanisms for the synergistic effect, and noted that some research suggested that tobacco smoke and asbestos act at different stages of the development of cancer. He expressed the opinion that: 

'While the precise mechanism of interaction between asbestos and tobacco smoke in causing lung cancer is not known, it is not possible in my view to separate their effects in the individual case when both have acted and it is thus more probable than not, that in this situation, the lung cancer was the singular result of the two factors acting together . It is however true that exposure to either factor alone is capable of causing lung cancer.' (emphasis added) 

[34] The meaning and effect of this passage of Dr Leigh's report was much debated in the course of the argument of the present appeals. In terms, the proposition advanced by Dr Leigh in this passage of his opinion was that when both smoking and asbestos cause cancer, the cancer is 'the singular result of the two factors acting together'. That proposition, if taken literally, would not address the question in issue in these cases. The question for decision in these cases is whether asbestos was a cause of the cancer. 

[35] Reading his opinion as a whole, it is evident that Dr Leigh did not express the view that, if a smoker has been exposed to asbestos and develops lung cancer, the asbestos exposure is, or is probably, a cause of that cancer. Dr Leigh expressly acknowledged not only that the precise mechanism of interaction between asbestos and tobacco smoke is not known, but also that it remains possible (for what he described as ""legal or administrative"" reasons) 'to partition attributability to smoking and asbestos under a variety of mathematical risk models'. To read the passage from his evidence about 'singular result of the two factors acting together' as saying that, if a smoker has been exposed to asbestos and develops lung cancer, the asbestos exposure is necessarily (even probably) a cause of the cancer, would not be consistent with his acknowledgement that the probability of causal connection can be divided ('partition[ed]') between the two carcinogens."" 

90The trial judge was found to have erred in two respects. First, his Honour had looked at cumulative exposure without considering the respective responsibilities of each defendant (a question not reached in the present case) and had treated a material contribution to risk as sufficient to demonstrate causation. Their Honours identified the relevant question as whether it was ""more probable than not that the negligence of the defendant was a cause of [the plaintiff's] cancer"": at [51]. They then addressed the first step in the plaintiff's argument which was that ""smoking and asbestos must work together"". In response to that their Honours stated at [54]: 

""It may be accepted (at least for the purposes of debate) that the synergistic or multiplicative effect suggests that in some cases the two carcinogens will have contributed to the development of an individual patient's cancer. But the proposition which the plaintiff advanced was an absolute proposition of universal application: smoking and asbestos must work together and they must have worked together in this case. That proposition was not established."" 

91Their Honours identified the issue in this way because that was the way in which the plaintiff had put his case. Assuming that it would be sufficient if it were established that smoking and asbestos worked together more often than not, the evidence in Amaca v Ellis did not establish any such proposition. Their Honours concluded at [65]: 

""It was not shown to be more probable than not that asbestos was a cause of (a necessary condition for) his cancer. It was not shown that exposure to asbestos made a material contribution to his cancer. Material contribution was not shown because a connection between [the plaintiff's] inhaling asbestos and his developing cancer was not demonstrated."" 

92In the present case, Dr Leigh explained his opinion in a manner which meant that the evidence before the Tribunal differed from that before the Courts in Amaca v Ellis . However, in order to succeed by demonstrating error in point of law, the appellant needed to demonstrate that Dr Leigh's evidence stood alone, in the sense that it was not contradicted, or that if contradicted, there was some erroneous application of legal principle in failing to accept his evidence in preference to other material. Not only did Dr Leigh not stand alone, but he did not have unequivocal support from any other witness. In a sense, it does not matter whether Dr Leigh obtained support; the real question is whether there was probative evidence to the contrary. If there were, his Honour was entitled to accept it. In any event, the supportive evidence relied on by the appellant was inadequate for the purpose. For example, the appellant relied on two passages in the evidence of Dr Nicholls, a consultant thoracic physician. In his report of 29 April 2009, Dr Nicholls stated: 

""There is considerable debate as to whether asbestos exposure in the absence of asbestosis increases the risk of bronchogenic carcinoma. However, I believe there is good evidence of a synergistic effect of smoking and asbestos exposure on the risk of developing lung cancer. Thus, I believe that his exposure to asbestos is definitely a contributing factor to his subsequent development of lung cancer."" 

93A number of comments may be made in respect of this evidence. First, if there is ""considerable debate"" on a point, it is difficult to see how one conclusion rather than the other could be said to be based on ""no evidence"". Secondly, his Honour accepted that there was a ""synergistic effect"". Thirdly, increase in risk of developing lung cancer does not equate with a material contribution to the development of a particular cancer. This was a fallacy exposed in Amaca v Ellis . What the evidence needed to show was that where the two agents coexisted, exposure to asbestos was a contributing factor in at least half of all cases. 

94A second passage, from a report of Dr Nicholls dated 18 December 2009 read as follows: 

""There is evidence that asbestos exposure is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer even in the absence of asbestosis. 

There is also evidence of a multiplicative risk of smoking and asbestos exposure in causation of lung cancer. ... 

Mr Evans has pleural plaques confirming his occupational history of exposure to asbestos. 

In view of the above comments, I believe it is impossible to ignore the effects of asbestos as a cause of the development of lung cancer in this gentleman."" 

95This passage is somewhat vague in its import and could only provide limited support to Dr Leigh. It was not the subject of elaboration or cross-examination when Dr Nicholls gave evidence. 

96The appellant also sought to call in aid the evidence of Professor Tattersall. Professor Tattersall did not provide unequivocal support for the plaintiff's case at trial. In his report of 20 August 2009 he expressed the belief that ""on the balance of probabilities occupational exposure to asbestos dust and fibre ... did NOT cause or make a material contribution to the development of Keith Evans' lung cancer"". The appellant, however, relied upon Professor Tattersall's evidence before the Tribunal. The following exchange took place (Tcpt, pp 137-138): 

""Q. Now, are you prepared to accept that there is some interaction between the carcinogens produced by tobacco smoke and asbestos fibre, particularly amphibole asbestos fibre. 
A - I think there is an interaction in lung tissue between the effects of cigarette exposure and asbestos fibre exposure, but I'm not sure there's any effect on asbestos fibres per se. 

Q. Right, so it is fair to say that a biological level the two act together in lung tissue. 
A - I think there is evidence that they can coexist and there is evidence that they can cause lung damage, the extent to which they interact has been a subject of considerable controversy over recent years. 

Q. Are you aware of the recent animal studies that have been conducted into the relationship between the carcinogens from tobacco smoke and amphibole asbestos. 
A - I have seen some of those papers, yes. 

Q. And you would accept from those would you not, that there is both a biological and genotoxicity effect for those two acting together to cause tissue damage, is that not so. 
A - I don't recall how the asbestos in those experiments was actually administered to the animals, but I am aware of experiments which have shown an interaction between biological tissues containing asbestos and products of cigarette smoke."" 

97The further passage appeared in the evidence of Professor Tattersall (Tcpt, p 141) in response to a question from the primary judge: 

""Q. ... We have heard from Dr James Leigh, who says that theoretically, because epidemiological studies that showed incidents of lung cancer with asbestos, secondly because asbestos has been shown to be a primary carcinogen in laboratory tests and thirdly because the combination of asbestos and tobacco products can together act, in animal studies and laboratory tests, in combination to produce cancers, that as a matter of theory all exposure to both tobacco and asbestos would have a concurrent that the asbestos contribution did something although it may be very minor. As a matter of theory, do you reject that reasoning. 

A - I accept it's a plausible hypothesis. I think the evidence you're referring to is incomplete and relates to animals given exposure in particular ways and cell culture experiments are, I think highly artefactual. The epidemiological evidence, as I understand it, is more discriminatory and as far as I am aware, in non-smokers the evidence that asbestos exposure causes a peranc or lung cancer is not supported by the evidence."" 

98There are aspects of this statement which are not entirely clear, but it did not provide unequivocal support for the hypothesis that in all or at least a majority of cases, the agents interact. 

Reliance upon Smith's case 
99There was discussion in the course of argument, both before the Tribunal and in this Court, as to the assistance which might be obtained by the appellant from Workers Compensation (Dust Diseases) Board of NSW v Smith, Munro and Seymour [2010] NSWCA 19. In fact, that case provides little assistance. The legal principle was, of course, the same, namely that the plaintiffs had to establish that their exposure to asbestos was, on the balance of probabilities, a contributing factor to their individual carcinomas: at [67]. There was evidence before the primary judge in that case as to the circumstances in which the synergistic effect operated. In particular, it was ""not entirely clear from the evidence ... whether the synergistic effect operated universally"": at [67]. This Court held that there was evidence on which her Honour could so find. Because the appeal was limited to a question of law, the challenge to the finding as to causation therefore failed. Subject to what follows, the same result must obtain in the present case. Indeed, the reasoning is stronger in the present case because it is an appeal by the plaintiff, who bore the onus of proof and, at least in theory, might not have succeeded even if all the evidence was in favour of the view that exposure to asbestos contributed to the lung cancer because it would do so in a majority of cases: see Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156 (Glass JA, Samuels JA agreeing). To interested parties reading these cases, it might be thought that similarly placed plaintiffs should, if the law is properly administered, either always succeed or always fail. The reason why that is not so is that the medical evidence is not a fixed quantity, but a variable. Further, because the medical evidence is contestable and contested, the outcomes may legitimately differ. This is a function of the shortcomings of medical science, not of the administration of justice. 

Reliance on Stamoulis 
100The appellant also sought to obtain support from the judgments of this Court in Sydney South West Area Health Service v Stamoulis [2009] NSWCA 153. In that case, the plaintiff had undergone a mammogram in February 2006. The radiologists, exercising reasonable skill and care, should have detected a cancerous growth: they did not. A second investigation in January 2007 discovered the breast cancer. There was a risk that the tumour would metastasize. Epidemiological evidence indicated that, if diagnosed in February 2006, the chance of metastasis was about 38%; if not diagnosed until January 2007, the chance rose to 42%. The plaintiff's tumour metastasized, leading to her subsequent death. The Court held that the 10% increase in risk, resulting from the delayed treatment, followed by the materialisation of the risk, was sufficient to demonstrate that the tortious conduct materially contributed to the metastasis. 

101This authority does not assist the appellant, for two primary reasons. First, the nature of the epidemiology is quite different: it was concerned with direct risk of metastasis, depending upon the stage at which the first carcinoma was detected and treated. It did not take a cohort of women whose tumours had metastasized and determine the effect of the delay. There was no similar case run for the appellant. Had there been, he would have needed to identify the risk of a man with his smoking history contracting lung cancer (said by counsel in the course of argument to be either 6% (for the appellant) or less than 10% (for the respondent)) and add to that the increased risk due to exposure to asbestos dust at the level experienced by the appellant (there was no indication of any figure in this respect). 

102Secondly, the reasoning in Stamoulis is not self-evidently correct, to the extent that it relied upon the epidemiology. By the time the metastases occurred, it was clear that the plaintiff was one of the 42 women in every 100 who would suffer that development. The critical question was whether she was one of the 38 whose tumour would have metastasized in any event, or one of the additional four in respect of whom the consequence flowed from the delay in obtaining treatment. Unless there were other material factors, specific to the plaintiff's case, the chance that she was in the critical group, rather than the base group, was 10.5%. On that evidence alone, it could not be said that the delay in treatment, on the probabilities, contributed to her metastasis. 

103Had there been evidence similar to that in Stamoulis in the present case, it would still not have been open to this Court to follow the reasoning in Stamoulis , to the extent that it equated a material increase in risk with a material contribution (in a causative sense) to the condition which eventuated. That reasoning was rejected by this Court in Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504, decided before Stamoulis , but subsequently confirmed by the High Court in Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; 240 CLR 537. 

Other challenges 
104The appellant raised a number of subsidiary complaints. First, the primary judge had undertaken his own calculations as to the level of exposure to asbestos dust and the resultant relative risk. There seemed to have been a number of elements to this challenge. The first was that such a calculation was not called for in any event because it was not necessary to establish a material contribution to the carcinoma. The effect of the other evidence in that respect has been discussed above. 

105A second element was that in calculating the level of exposure to asbestos, the primary judge rejected the calculations of two industrial hygienists called by the respondent, but failed to simply adopt the evidence of Professor Pooley, tendered by the appellant, based upon examination of the fibre burden in a sample of tissue obtained from Mr Evans' lung. As the appellant noted, Professor Pooley was not cross-examined. However, his conclusion was expressed in very general terms, to the effect that ""[t]he levels of amphibole asbestos fibres detected are well in excess of those considered to be related to an environmental asbestos exposure but are equivalent to a low level occupational exposure"": report, 6 November 2009. There was debate as to the significance to be attached to the number of fibres detected and their length. There was also debate as to the rate at which fibres would have cleared from the lungs, given that Mr Evans had not been exposed to asbestos for some 18 years at the date the sample was taken: at [183]. 

106The trial judge discussed this evidence at [178]-[186], but concluded, in effect, that it did not assist him in determining the level of exposure because the original fibre burden in Mr Evans' lungs was unknown: at [186]. 

107This material was considered as part of a submission that a numerical estimate of asbestos exposure was not possible and that the objectively assessable evidence was that of the presence of pleural plaques and diffuse pleural thickening. 

108The structure of the reasons of the primary judge may have been unfortunate in relation to this discussion. His Honour determined his preferred figure for the number of fibre years of exposure before addressing these arguments. Nevertheless, the fact that he accepted a figure more than six times that proposed by the defendants' industrial hygienists, makes it difficult for the appellant to establish legal error. His Honour's acceptance that there was ""significant asbestos exposure"" was consistent with at least some of the evidence as to the inference to be derived from the pleural plaques. He further noted that there was ""no evidence that correlates the presence of diffuse pleural thickening with an increased risk of contracting lung cancer"": at [177]. In that respect, there was an implicit contrast with the correlation which might be based on asbestosis, a condition from which Mr Evans did not suffer. 

109It should be noted that a ground of appeal which complained that the calculations were undertaken ""in the absence of available satisfactory evidence"" does not in terms identify any error of law. There was evidence available from which his Honour could draw inferences and make calculations and indeed could have made calculations less favourable to the appellant. Whether the evidence was ""satisfactory"" was a matter for him to determine, so long as it could be described as rationally probative as to the existence of a fact in issue. As noted in Amaba Pty Ltd v Booth [2010] NSWCA 344 at [23]: 

""Implicit in the statement that there is no evidence to 'support' a particular finding, is the characterisation of a relationship between the evidence and the finding. It is the same relationship inherent in the concept of ""relevance"", on which the laws of evidence depend. That relationship depends on a process of reasoning which must be logical or rational. Thus, evidence is relevant which, if accepted, 'could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding': Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 55(1). As explained by Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Washer v Western Australia [2007] HCA 48; 234 CLR 492 at [5]: 

'The word 'rationally' is significant in this context. In order to establish relevance, it is necessary to point to a process of reasoning by which the information in question could affect the jury's assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue at the trial.'"" 

110To complain that the trial judge made his own calculations is not, in the context of this trial, to complain that he acted without any evidence, or that he usurped the functions of the experts. He relied on the available material and drew inferences. Whether the inferences were reasonably open, in the sense of being logically available, involves an evaluative judgment, which is to be assessed by the court exercising appellate or supervisory jurisdiction. If this were the basis of complaint, it must be rejected. 

111Secondly, the appellant asserted error in point of law in ""failing to give reasons for rejecting the proposition that the increase in risk demonstrated by his Honour's own calculations was capable on its own of proving material contribution"": ground 1(g). With respect, that ground also contains the seeds of its own destruction. An increase in ""risk"" does not demonstrate a material contribution unless the ""risk"" shows that the tortious agent more probably than not contributed to the injury. In this context, talk of ""risk"" is somewhat misleading. Risk usually identifies the chance of a future occurrence; what is relevant in the present case, is a causal link between two events in the past. As has already been explained, the cause of the carcinoma need not have been only one agent, or another. Agents may have worked in combination. The fact that they undoubtedly do work in combination in some circumstances will be sufficient to demonstrate a contribution by the tortious agent if it is more likely than not that the tortious agent contributed in more than half the cases. Because that fact was not unequivocally demonstrated on the evidence, it is not possible to complain of error in point of law because his Honour failed to accept evidence which did support such a conclusion. It is only when such evidence has been accepted that it is necessary to consider whether the contribution was in fact material, as opposed to insignificant or insubstantial. That question was not reached in the present case. 

112Finally, it should be noted that Queanbeyan City Council filed a notice of contention noting that a decision as to the aggregate exposure of Mr Evans to asbestos dust did not answer the question about the particular responsibility of each defendant. That statement was neither true nor relevant. The negative conclusion reached by the primary judge did answer the question, in favour of each defendant. The further question identified accordingly did not arise. It is not necessary to say more about the contention. 

113The appellant has failed to identify a decision of the Tribunal in point of law which was shown to be erroneous. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. The appellant must pay the costs of the respondents in this Court. 

Judicial review application 
114To avoid the possibility that there may have been jurisdictional error or error of law on the face of the record which did not fall within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court under s 32 of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act , the appellant also commenced proceedings by way of summons under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), seeking relief in the nature of certiorari, quashing the orders of Judge Curtis. The grounds in the summons were the same as those in the notice of appeal. Reliance on the summons proved unnecessary, and its presence cannot have significantly affected the costs incurred. It is appropriate to dismiss the summons with no order as to costs.

		05 August 2011",2011-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2757536,Donai v R [2011] NSWCCA 173,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL:  Terry Mark Donai, the appellant, was convicted following a trial with a jury of the murder of Pamela and William Weightman in January 2000. He was sentenced to two concurrent counts of life imprisonment.
2He appeals against his conviction and sentences.
3There was no dispute at the trial that the Weightmans had been strangled and died in their home. There was also no dispute that their bodies were then taken from the home in the family car to Heathcote National Park where the car was either pushed over or at slow speed travelled over an embankment running off Heathcote Road onto a fire service road. This was done in order to attempt to simulate their death in a car accident.
4The police did not immediately identify that the Weightmans had been murdered. Some time after the original investigation the police, with the assistance of forensic analysis, established that the cause of death was not a motorcar accident but rather they had been strangled.
5The police suspected that the appellant was involved. In order to assist the investigation an undercover police officer posing as the boss of an organised criminal gang befriended the appellant. Their conversations were recorded on a listening device.
6During the course of a conversation the appellant admitted that he had assisted David Weightman (the deceased's son) shortly after the killings to transport the bodies from the family home to the National Park where they were disposed of.
7In addition to the murder charges the appellant was also charged with the alternative count of being accessory after the fact to murder. The admission made to the undercover police officer presented the defence with considerable difficulty. I discuss these issues in greater detail below.
8The murders occurred in January 2000. The trial took place in 2007. The appellant was sentenced in May 2008. The delay between trial and sentencing was explained in the remarks on sentence of the trial judge. Due to the delay, the appellant also requires an extension of time to seek leave to appeal.
9The notice of appeal against conviction identifies thirteen grounds. They do not involve ""a question of law alone"" (s 5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912) and hence require leave. I would grant the necessary leave.
10The grounds of appeal are:
Ground 1:The trial miscarried.Ground 2:The trial judge erred in admitting evidence that was wholly prejudicial to the accused.Ground 3:The trial judge erred in failing to give appropriate directions at the time of the admission of the prejudicial evidence. Ground 4:The trial judge failed when summing up to properly or adequately direct the jury as to how they could use the evidence of the statements made by the accused.Ground 5:The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury in respect to corroboration.Ground 6:The trial judge erred in failing to reject and/or have stricken from the record an unresponsive answer.Ground 7:The trial judge erred in allowing the witness Weightman to respond to a leading question inviting hearsayGround 8:The trial judge erred in failing to give the jury a direction on lies.Ground 9:The trial judge erred in admitting of further prejudicial evidence and in failing to sufficiently direct the jury.Ground 10:The trial judge erred in refusing to direct that a witness be recalled.Ground 11:The trial judge erred in her summation of the evidence.Ground 12 The accused was incompetently represented.Ground 13:The verdicts are unsafe and unreasonable in all the circumstances.
The prosecution case
11The Crown provided a useful summary of the prosecution case which I have utilised in the following account.
12The dead bodies of William Weightman and his wife Pamela were discovered by a Park Ranger in the Royal National Park at Heathcote on Sunday morning 9 January 2000. Their green coloured Mitsubishi Magna sedan was seen by the ranger over the embankment about 20 metres below wedged against a tree. Inside the car in the driver's seat was Mr Weightman slumped in the footwell, and Mrs Weightman was in the front passenger seat secured by her seatbelt.
13Police attended the scene. In due course, a post-mortem examination was conducted and at that stage the deaths were considered to be accidental. Mrs Weightman died as a result of the combined effects of blunt force head injury and the aspiration of gastric contents. Mr Weightman died as a result of the combined effects of positional asphyxia and the inhalation of gastric contents. There was no inquest.
14The Weightmans had in fact been murdered the day before, on Saturday 8 January 2000. A motorist, Mr Lynch, had around 11 pm that night seen the green Mitsubishi Magna turn into Heathcote Road at an intersection which was 1.7 kilometres from where the Mitsubishi was steered off the embankment. He noticed a driver and a front passenger. On the Crown case, Mr Weightman was on the back seat in readiness to be positioned as the pretence driver.
15In June 2001 concerns were raised about the matter and police commenced to re-investigate. The forensic pathologist provided an amended report to the coroner in relation to each deceased.
16In relation to Mr Weightman, the doctor noted there were bilateral fractures of the thyroid cartilage. A forensic pathologist, Dr Kevin Lee gave evidence that this was rarely seen in motor car accidents and typically found in the compression of the throat in strangulation. Asphyxia had also been a component of Mrs Weightman's death. This also was quite unusual in the course of a motor vehicle accident. It was the kind of occurrence resulting from strangulation or suffocation.
17Toxicological analysis of the blood from each of the deceased showed the presence of a sedative drug (although it was not Serapax to which reference will later be made). Whilst the drug in Mrs Weightman's system would not have caused sedation the same could not be said of Mr Weightman. He had almost ten times the therapeutic level of promethazine in his system.
18In relation to both deceased the doctor noted bruising on their arms and legs which was not consistent with trauma from a road accident, and the extent and severity of which were suggestive of some form of restraint or assault.
19Mr Weightman had an abrasion on the centre of his forehead, one on his chin and one on his left cheek but the pattern of these injuries did not correspond with the steering wheel. There were multiple bruises to his chest, the front part of the bone of the hip, both arms and both legs. The evidence was that these were also unlikely to have been caused in the collision. In particular, three spherical shaped bruises to the left upper arm indicated he had been firmly gripped or pinioned by another person. The right leg also displayed bruising from the mid thigh to the ankle, including the outer aspect of the knee. The left leg had mottled bruising on the thigh and to below the knee.
20Mrs Weightman also had multiple bruises to her head, both arms and right leg. The pattern of these injuries also indicated her arms and legs had been gripped or pinioned by another.
21A crash reconstruction expert, Sergeant Kelly, concluded the car had gone over the embankment at low speed, possibly 5 kph.
22David Weightman was the adopted son of the deceased. They had no other children. He was the sole beneficiary of their estate. He gave evidence in the trial for the prosecution and frankly said his parents were killed so that he could gain by way of inheritance.
23The appellant was a friend of Weightman. Following the killing of his parents Weightman fell out with the appellant because apparently Weightman made no effort to pay him money. There was an issue in the trial as to whether Weightman owed the appellant money for having participated in the murder or whether the appellant had simply lent money to Weightman for some unidentified reason.
24There was evidence in the trial of the appellant pursuing this debt. A month after the deceased died Mrs Urwin, Mrs Weightman's sister, received a call from the appellant claiming Weightman owed him $17,000 which he said he had lent David for a motor bike. This did not make sense to Mrs Urwin because she and her husband had lent money themselves to David to purchase a motorbike. On the appellant's own admission he was in possession of a large sum of cash shortly after the death of the deceased. His explanation was that he made $18,000 to $20,000 in a couple of months from quite a few jobs in Wollongong and lent Weightman $6,000.
25In February 2004, almost four years after the Weightmans' death, David Weightman confessed his guilt to his aunt. Mrs Margaret Urwin had strongly suspected her nephew's involvement in the murder and confronted him on Sunday 1 February 2004 on the driveway of his home at Bradbury when he confessed. When he first admitted his guilt to her he nominated the appellant as being the person implicated with him. He told Mrs Urwin that ""Terry"" killed the deceased but shortly thereafter retracted it. Mrs Urwin's husband and other members of her family were present when this occurred. Apparently Mrs Urwin said to Weightman, ""All I want to hear from your mouth is what you did to my sister and her husband?"" He replied so that all could hear, ""Terry killed them"". Mrs Urwin and Weightman then moved higher up the driveway so that they were not beside the others. David Weightman then said to her ""I killed them. I've fucked up me life. I'm an arsehole (or shithead)"". When Mrs Urwin then asked him if Terry was involved he said ""no"" (T 48-53).
26The following day, 2 February 2004, David Weightman was taken into police custody and interviewed. He admitted his involvement in the murder of his parents. On 10 October 2005 he entered pleas of guilty to their murder. On 23 December 2005 he was sentenced, receiving a discount for his assistance to the authorities.
27When giving evidence David Weightman said that he met the appellant about a month or two prior to the murders. About 2½ weeks before his parents' death he was invited to the appellant's house at Jindabyne. Weightman told him that he expected to be the sole beneficiary of his parents' estate consisting of considerable assets. During the journey back to Campbelltown they spoke about their mutual interest in motorbikes. Weightman described what he called a ""surface conversation"" with the appellant concerning his parents if they died. The appellant told David that if ""he took care of them"" (his parents) he expected to be given a new ""Hayabuza"" motor bike, ""at the time the fastest bike in the world... the beez neez"" (T 142), as payment. Such a motorbike was worth about $18,000 to $19,000. Weightman made it clear to the appellant that he did not want to be there if it happened and hence not haunted by bad dreams and also that he did not want his parents to feel pain.
28Weightman gave evidence that on Saturday evening 8 January the appellant gave him some Serapax tablets to put in his parents tea with the object of putting them to sleep. Weightman put two or three tablets in each cup of tea he made for his parents and then went outside to where the appellant was waiting. He told the appellant, ""There you go Terry, I've given them the tablets"" and the appellant went inside whilst he waited outside. Weightman did not actually see his parents drink the tea. His mother took her cup upstairs and he left his father on the couch with his cup.
29After hearing his mother scream Weightman gave evidence the appellant emerged from the house breathless and sweating. The appellant said, ""I need a hand with your dad"" as the effort in killing the mother was considerable and had taken something out of him. They went inside the house together towards Mr Weightman who was still on the couch. They struggled with Mr Weightman. David held his father's chest, arms and a bit of his leg section whilst the appellant put a pillow over his father's face suffocating him.
30Upstairs David Weightman's mother was already lying dead on the bed. Together they carried her down the stairs to the garage. Weightman carried her legs and the appellant carried her upper body. She was placed in the front passenger seat of the car. They carried Mr Weightman and placed him in the back section of the car on the floor. He then drove his parents' car following the appellant to the location in the National Park where they pushed the car over the edge of the embankment. Before doing so Mr Weightman was moved into the driver's seat, the car was switched on and the door was shut. Weightman said the car was not going very fast when it went over the embankment.
31Weightman said the appellant took the pillow from the house that was used in the killing.
32The appellant was interviewed by the police on 19 November 2002 when, at that time, he was living in Cooma. He denied any involvement in the death of the Weightmans or disposal of their bodies. He said that on the date they died he was with his mother at Windang, adding ""she'll verify that. If you ask any of the residents they will verify that."" His mother lived in a caravan at Oaklands Village, Windang. He further added his mother's partner, Paul, was also at the caravan. When the appellant later spoke to undercover police (4 years later) he said that this alibi was false.
33He further told police that he had known Weightman for about 1 year but denied that they were ""fairly close friends at that stage"", preferring the description ""acquaintances"". He said he had done some concrete resurfacing for them and had been paid ""fourteen hundred dollars I think"" for the work and they had been happy with the work he had done. He said that he lent Weightman $6,000 to help him get a motor cycle after his parents died but was never repaid. He went on to say Weightman had two bikes - a Harley Davidson and a Japanese road bike - and the money was to help him purchase the Harley. He said at the time of Weightmans' death he had made about $18,000 in the previous months, which his mother could verify. He said he did not ""put anything in the bank because they slug you, you know"".
34In March 2004, six or so weeks after Weightman admitted to his aunt his involvement in the murders, a police undercover operative, UC3 went to Cooma, where the appellant was known to be residing in order to speak with him. His purpose was to attempt to have the appellant visit Weightman in custody and possibly provoke admissions. The undercover operative obtained the appellant's mobile telephone number from people who knew him. UC3 then made telephone contact with the appellant and they met in a park on 26 March 2004. UC3 told the appellant that Weightman wanted to see him. UC3 gave the appellant $200 towards his expenses in visiting Weightman.
35The police thereafter put into place an undercover operation of the type considered in Tofilau v The Queen [2007] HCA 39; 231 CLR 396. Police, posing as members of an organised criminal gang, interacted with the appellant and gained his confidence to reveal what criminal acts he had done in the past and what he was prepared to do for the gang.
36Evidence was led of taped confessions between the appellant and a number of undercover operatives. Between 13 December 2005 and 16 June 2006, UC2 (known as Jack Simpson) had a large number of meetings and telephone conversations with the appellant. This culminated on 16 June 2006 with the appellant being introduced to UCl, the purported head of the gang.
37It was the Crown case that whilst the appellant made significant admissions in this conversation with UCl he nonetheless told him a sanitised version of the truth minimising his own role. It was suggested that he did not ""fully reveal"" himself to the undercover officer but only partly revealed himself.
38At the commencement of their meeting UCl informed the appellant that there was a ""problem"" and that Weightman had spoken to the police about 3 or 4 weeks earlier. UCl quizzed the appellant about it.
39The appellant told UCl that Weightman had killed his parents after which Weightman had contacted him and asked him how to dispose of the bodies. The appellant said he offered the suggestion ""put 'em over a cliff"". The appellant said when he got to the Weightman's house the bodies were on the garage floor. Weightman had suffocated them with a pillow. He said Weightman subsequently disposed of the pillow at a charity bin in Campbelltown. He said Weightman had killed his mother in bed and his father downstairs and dragged them to the garage on his own. The appellant then drove the car with the two bodies in it to Heathcote Road whilst Weightman followed in another car. In exchange for his assistance the appellant was promised ""15 grand"".
40The appellant also told UCl that after the event he had lent David Weightman some money to buy a motorbike. Weightman promised to repay this money plus the 15 grand but never did.
41At the conclusion of the operation UCl left the room and the police entered. The appellant was placed under arrest and taken into custody.
42On 17 June 2006 at the Parramatta Bail Court, the appellant attempted to pass a piece of paper to a woman in the public gallery. It was intercepted by a Corrective Services officer and given to the prosecution. The note proclaimed the appellant's innocence of involvement in the murders. It related that Weightman ""asked me if I could alibi him for the day he killed his parents. He then told me everything that he had planned and told me what he had done. I told him to fuck off and left"".
43Mr and Mrs Weightman had two cars. The one which was not used to dispose of their bodies was a white Hyundai motor car. There was evidence that David Weightman either gave this car to the appellant or allowed him to use it after the crime. Shortly after the deceased were killed the appellant and Weightman were together at a cafe in Berridale run by Paula Harrison. The appellant, who knew Ms Harrison, told her that Weightman was giving him his mother's car. Kaye Byron, who had at one time previously been in a relationship with the appellant, saw him one day sometime after the deceased were killed in possession of this car.
44There was evidence rebutting the suggestion that the appellant had the funds he said he had to give to Weightman. Merilene Stoyles was in a relationship with the appellant from May 2000 until August 2000. She gave evidence that he was not employed during this time and, apart from a little bit of spray concreting work, was reliant on the single parent pension. The evidence indicated that he did not contribute to household expenses, lived off her, and borrowed a lot of money from her which he never paid back.
45The appellant's Commonwealth Bank account for the period September 1999 to June 2000 indicated his only source of income to be social security payments except for a deposit of $4,000 on 27 October 1999 and $2,000 on 22 February 2000. On 5 November 1999 the appellant borrowed $12,000 from the Westpac Bank by extending his home loan. This loan was in the joint names of him and Kaye Byron. The withdrawal slip was signed by him alone.
46The appellant demonstrated a keen concern for David Weightman following his parent's death. The appellant told Ms Stoyles that Weightman was his best friend and he was concerned about him because his parents had died. He told her he had lent him money after his parents had died to help pay for funeral expenses. The appellant had told her this had been something like $12,000 or $20,000 - she could not remember which one exactly. This was apparently false because there was evidence from the Urwins that they had provided the money for the funeral expenses.
47I have already referred to the fact that there was evidence of the appellant contacting Mrs Urwin about money he said Weightman owed him. Ms Stoyles gave evidence that the appellant made numerous telephone calls to Weightman asking for money. The evidence on one occasion indicated that Neil Murray visited Weightman's home just prior to the latter going to England. The appellant arrived. After the appellant left the evidence indicated that David Weightman said to Mr Murray, ""Terry said I owe him $17,000"".
48Mrs Weightman owned a white Hyundai motor car. This was part of the estate that David Weightman was to inherit. Ms Byron, the appellant's former girlfriend gave evidence that the appellant told her that David Weightman asked him to take the car off him so he would not have to see it around the streets reminding him of his parents. The appellant suggested his girlfriend buy the car but this did not happen.
49Ms Harrison was a friend of Ms Byron. Ms Harrison, either before or after Christmas 2000 was introduced by the appellant to ""David"". Her description of ""David"" (dark complexion, dark hair and the mention that David's parents had just died) matched David Weightman. She gave evidence that either the appellant or David said the husband and wife were drugged and they were killed by another vehicle and that they had a lot of money.
The defence case
50The appellant did not give evidence. Evidence was adduced duringcross-examination of a police officer that the appellant, apart from trafficmatters, had no prior convictions.
The appeal
51Ground 1 states that the trial miscarried. This was advanced in the nature of an assertion of the consequences of success on other grounds of appeal.
52Ground 2 is concerned with the contents of a recording of a conversation between the appellant and the police. There was also a tape recording of material obtained from a listening device tendered at the trial which was not the subject of objection and is not the subject of complaint in the appeal. That tape contained the conversation with the undercover police officer which occurred in a room at Coogee on 16 June 2006 when the appellant admitted being an accessory after the fact to the murders in that he assisted Weightman to dispose of the bodies. It was at the end of this conversation that other police officers entered the room and arrested the appellant. Realising that he had been speaking with a police officer the appellant immediately said ""No, everything I have told you is not true.""
53The controversy in this appeal relates to the earlier occasions on which the appellant spoke with police officers. Although it is accepted that part of those conversations were properly admitted it is asserted in the appeal that other portions were not. No objection was taken to the tender of any part of the recording at the trial and accordingly leave under Rule 4 is required to raise this ground. For reasons which emerge below I would grant that leave and uphold this ground of appeal.
54I have previously referred to the controversial evidence but greater detail is appropriate.
55Exhibit V recorded the conversation between UC3 and the appellant in a park at Cooma. UC3 told the appellant that Weightman, who was in gaol, wanted to see him. UC3 told the appellant that he ""did a bit of this and that"" and that Weightman had worked for him. UC3 told the appellant that he had taken the trouble to track him down because ""keeping him (Weightman) happy inside is somethin' that would ah, you know, be in my best interest as well. So while he's happy, you know - and if that means comin down here and askin you to go and see him, then that's what I'm willin to do."" During the course of the conversation the appellant said: ""Mate, the last thing I want is any fucken hit men after me ... I've got guns at home. I wont hesitate to use them ... you know, if someone fucken comes to my house and threatens me or my family I'll use them.""
56There is another passage in the transcript where there is a reference to ""someone's been done for fucken' drugs."" There is also a passage where the appellant told UC3 ""like, I've got a family. I've got kids and shit. I'm not going to get involved in any shit too. Like, I do shit years ago mate. I used to do some bad stuff.""
57Perhaps the most damning admission made by the appellant are the passages where the appellant made reference to his willingness to undertake a contract killing and said that he had murdered two people in the past and organised for them to be disposed in vats of hot iron. It is unnecessary to set out the transcript of the complete conversation. The following extract is sufficient:
""Is there anything that you wouldn't be prepared to do with us? Like, where would you draw the line?""
Appellant:I'd never kill a child.. that's about as far as I'd draw the line.
Yeah? No dramas with adults, and stuff like that? Cause you know from time to time that sort of stuff comes up?
Appellant:Mmmm
Tell me what you think it's about
Appellant:Oh. Could be numbers of things. It could be invading other people's privacy, I guess. It could be knocking people off. It could be a very sticky situation.
Well, you're on the line, mate. We're talking about knocking people off.
Appellant:Yeah. Yeah.
Contract killing
Appellant:Yeah
You know
Appellant:Contract killing
Um, Or either contract killing, or um, if, if something in our way. If somethings in our way and it, and there is no alternative.
Appellant:Eliminate it
Yeah
Appellant:Yeah
Take them out of the picture
Do you have any problem with that?
Appellant:No, its part of the parcel
You sure?
Appellant:Yes
Appellant:I can hunt down an animal, kill an animal. Its no different to a human.. No I wouldn't find it hard Jack. I wouldn't find it hard to kill someone. As long as it wasn't someone too close .. I mean, like brother, fuckin auntie, all this type of shit.. Look, look it comes down to it, yes I can do it.
You mentioned to me, um a while back that you'd knocked a couple of blokes over, over a deal of grass. What was that about?
Appellant:He broke in me house and stole cash and grass off me.. a pound
And what did you do with him?
Appellant:Fixed him up.
What do you mean, you, you knocked him?
Appellant:Mm
Yeah? Well did you just leave the body there, or did you get rid of it?
Appellant:No, I had a friend that worked for the SRA.
Yeah
Appellant:He's a blacksmith
Yeah?
Appellant:And they have these big vats full of hot iron. He went straight in.
And you hit him with a .357 you said?
Appellant:Mmm.""
58The appellant advances a number of submissions with respect to this evidence. Senior counsel on his behalf emphasised that evidence disclosing bad character is generally not admissible against an accused person. His admission of having committed other crimes and his willingness to commit crimes was not relevant to his prosecution for the present offences. The evidence was not led as tendency evidence, was not admissible as context evidence and was in any event wholly prejudicial to the appellant.
59The appellant submitted that the admissibility of the evidence was never addressed at the trial and that, furthermore, her Honour failed to give appropriate directions in relation to it, either at the time of the admission of the evidence or in her subsequent directions. 
60The Crown responded to the appellant's submissions by submitting that merely because evidence which is otherwise admissible reveals another criminal offence it must not necessarily be rejected. I considered the issue in Steer v R (2008) NSWCCA 295 at [33]. I need not repeat my earlier remarks. The appellant does not take issue with the view I expressed in Steer but rather submitted that in the circumstances of this case the evidence was of little if any evidentiary value and was overwhelmingly prejudicial.
61Counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial gave evidence to this Court. He explained that he made a deliberate decision not to object to the evidence. He said that he believed the position was covered by the decision in Tofilau but was not aware of the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Hill [2006] VSCA 41.
62Tofilau was concerned with whether admissions made to undercover police officers who were posing as criminal gang leaders were voluntary. The High Court determined that they were voluntary and furthermore that there was no reason of public policy to reject their admission into evidence.
63The issue was also considered In Hill where the police used similar methodology to that used in Tofilau and the present case. Although the evidence was admitted in Hill Buchanan JA at [113] recognised ""the collateral prejudice"" that could be occasioned where the jury came to believe that an accused person was actively involved with criminals.
64Whether or not the jury believed everything the appellant said to the police to be true the evidence irretrievably prejudiced the appellant when the jury came to assess his denial of any involvement in the killings or disposition of the bodies as against the evidence that he was involved. Weightman's evidence in relation to the appellant made his conviction likely. The picture of the appellant reflected in his conversations with police made his conviction inevitable.
65Ground 12 of the grounds of appeal complains that the appellant's counsel at trial did not competently represent him. As I have indicated no objection was taken to the evidence of the appellant's propensity for serious criminal acts. I am satisfied that it should have been and that the failure to do so has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Although an appellate court will be slow to intervene when difficulties have arisen because of a deliberate tactical decision by defence counsel TKWJ v The Queen 212 CLR 124 it would have been possible to allow parts of the conversation into evidence to support a submission that the appellant was big noting himself without the material which overwhelmingly blackened his character. This is one case where the injustice occasioned to the appellant should be remedied and a new trial ordered.
66Ground 2 is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. However there are a number of further grounds of appeal.
67Ground 3 complains that the trial judge erred in failing to give appropriate directions at the time of the admission of the prejudicial evidence. Ground 4 complains that the trial judge failed when summing up to properly or adequately direct the jury as to how they could use the evidence of the statements made by the accused.
68These grounds assume that the evidence was properly admitted. Because I am of the opinion that the evidence should not have been admitted these grounds have little significance. In my opinion there was nothing which the trial judge could effectively have done to redress the difficulties created by the admission of the evidence.
69Under ground 5 the appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed that they could not use the statement of the appellant that he had assisted Weightman in the disposal of the bodies as in any way corroborating Weightman, in the sense of giving weight or adding support to Weightman's evidence that the appellant had committed the murders. The appellant complains that the jury was not directed that they could not use this evidence to corroborate or add weight to Weightman's evidence that the appellant was the murderer, but that they were very likely to reason in this manner.
70In the alternative it was submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to what parts of the appellant's statement could be used as corroboration or support and how. It was submitted that a full Murray ((1987) 11 NSWLR 12) direction was required.
71I do not believe there is substance in this ground. It was reasonably open to the jury to take the view that the appellant's admitted course of conduct to the undercover police officers was more consistent with Weightman's evidence that the appellant had participated in the murders than not. Accordingly, the evidence would tend to confirm the truth of Weightman's evidence.
72With respect to the issue of a Murray direction I am not persuaded that her Honour did not direct the jury as she was required to do. She told the jury on repeated occasions that acceptance of the truth and reliability of David Weightman's evidence was essential to prove the Crown case of murder against the appellant. Her Honour instructed the jury to ""examine and scrutinise David Weightman's evidence with great care and emphasised that it was only through Weightman that they were told of the appellant's planning and participation in the murders. Her Honour told the jury to carefully consider David Weightman's honesty and reliability and reminded the jury that when assessing his evidence they should be mindful of lies which he had told to psychiatrists and an insurance company. 
73Ground 6 relates to a question and answer given by UC2 in evidence at the trial. The exchange was as follows:
""Q:Why was it your expectation that, at the meeting that occurred on 16 June 2006, Mr Donai would perhaps confess in his part of the murder of the Weightmans.
A:I got to know Terry, as you are aware, in about November, I think it was from memory 2005. I spent a considerable amount of time with Terry, over which time we spoke about all sorts of things. Given the background of the case and getting to know - sorry, the defendant at the level at which I was purporting to operate, it became my belief, my firm belief, that on the day that the defendant was arrested that it was in fact he who had murdered the Weightmans.""
74The appellant submitted that the answer was not responsive to the question, was highly prejudicial and should have been struck out and the jury told to ignore it.
75It was submitted that the question asked was unusual and invited a response which was inadmissible. The response which was given should not have been admitted.
76However, it would have been no surprise to the jury to be told by a police officer who had been involved in the investigation that he or she believed that the appellant had been involved in the murders. The evidence was addressed by her Honour who told the jury in clear terms to ignore any view which a police officer had about the guilt or innocence of the appellant. That direction was sufficient to deal with any problems.
77Ground 7 is concerned with the following questions and responses in the evidence in chief of David Weightman:
""Q:Having had the initial conversation with Terry Donai in relation to your parents, did you say anything to any other of your friends before your parents died about what might happen in the near future?
FLYNN:I object to this, your Honour.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:If I confine it to a 'yes' or 'no' answer and a who rather than the substance, your Honour?
HER HONOUR:What is the objection, Mr Flynn? The question is - is this the import of the question: If anyone else was told before the killing and the accused's intention to kill the Weightmans?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:That's right.
HER HONOUR:What is the objection?
FLYNN:I withdraw the objection, your Honour. I am just concerned about the witness volunteering information.
HER HONOUR:Just 'yes' or 'no', Mr Weightman.
WITNESS:Yes, ma'am.
HER HONOUR:Q:Was anyone else told?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:Q:Who was that person
A:That was Stephen Sullivan.""
78The appellant complained that the trial judge should not have reformatted the question in a leading form. However, this was clearly done with the consent of both counsel and the complaint is unjustified. 
79It was further submitted that because Stephen Sullivan was not asked questions about this issue when he gave evidence the trial judge should have directed the jury to ignore it. No such direction was sought. It was a minor matter and of little moment during the trial and if there be a difficulty it has not contributed to any miscarriage of justice.
80In relation to ground 8 it was the Crown case that there was no loan from the appellant to David Weightman and that accordingly the money that he sought from Weightman following the killings was his reward for his involvement in the enterprise. The appellant gave differing accounts for the money, including that it was repayment of a loan to facilitate Weightman acquiring a motorbike. 
81The Crown Prosecutor did not submit to the jury that the appellant's account contained lies told out of a consciousness of guilt. However, the Crown Prosecutor did tell the jury on more than one occasion that given the inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence he lacked credibility. There being no submission that lies were told out of a consciousness of guilt an Edwards direction was not required (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193).
82Presumably the appellant was submitting that a direction of the type contemplated in Zoneff v The Queen [2000] 200 CLR 234 was required. The appellant emphasised the fact that her Honour said in the course of her summing-up:
""It is the Crown case that the accused has never been known to give a consistent reason for the money owed to him or a consistent claim in a dollar amount for the money owed him because he has been unable, for obvious reasons, to reveal the real reason for the debt.""
83The appellant submitted that this summation to the jury of the Crown case made it clear that the Crown was suggesting that the appellant had deliberately lied and that his lies reflected knowledge on his part that telling the truth would implicate him in the offence. It was submitted that such an approach required a Zoneff direction even if the Crown did not rely upon the evidence as consciousness of guilt.
84The line of reasoning suggested by the appellant would involve the jury in drawing inferences. Before the passage complained of her Honour had reminded the jury that the money could have been for a motorbike or possibly money to spend on drugs. The risk of the line of reasoning complained about in the appeal did not present itself to her Honour or either counsel. No direction was sought. James J in Rend v R (2006) NSWCCA 41 at [69] said:
""In R v Douglas [2005] NSWCCA 419 this Court referred with approval to what was said by Hunt CJ at CL, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, in R v Tange (1997) 92 A Crim R 545:
'In my view, even in cases where the lie is relied upon by the Crown only in relation to the credit of the accused, it is best for the judge to direct the jury that they should not find him guilty simply because he has told a lie, but it is not an error where that has not been done, and it is even less meritorious as an appeal point when the trial judge (as here) has not been requested to do so.'""
85To my mind this ground of appeal lacks merit.
86Ground 9 is concerned with a note passed by the appellant to his girlfriend on 17 June 2006 at Parramatta court. The note was admitted into evidence. The note both proclaimed the appellant's innocence and said David Weightman asked him to provide a false alibi.
87I am not sure what complaint is now made about the matter. The note did not support the appellant being involved in the murder and it was not suggested to the jury that it was prejudicial to the appellant. The trial judge referred to it in passing. I can identify no prejudice to the appellant from the admission of the note or the manner in which it was dealt with in the course of the trial.
88In relation to ground 10, during the trial it became apparent that Weightman had sought to resile from his pleas and contest his convictions in this Court. Trial counsel sought to have him recalled but the judge rejected the application. These events occurred during the course of defence counsel's address.  The appeal documents were examined and in the words of her Honour reveal that ""because Weightman didn't physically handle his mother in the same way he physically participated in handling his father in the course of him being killed, Weightman's got it in his thinking that he should not have been convicted of that murder. I also infer that, on any view of the principles of common purpose, he was, on his own admission, unquestionably guilty of the murder of his mother notwithstanding the fact that he did not in any way physically manipulate her or handle her in the course of her being asphyxiated.""
89Defence counsel did not seek to put any other interpretation on Weightman's appeal. Her Honour proceeded to decline the application which was effectively abandoned. There was no reasonable basis for a belief that further cross-examination of this topic would have been of assistance to the appellant.
90Under ground 11 of the appeal the appellant makes two complaints. During the course of her summing-up the trial judge said:
""The Crown asks you to ask yourselves what reaction the accused may have had to being challenged as to the professionalism of the job or the charge involved. The Crown says whilst the accused has been in pains to tell people, including Ms Byron, Ms Stoyles and the police, how wonderful Mr and Mrs Weightman were as people and parents, that David Weightman gives quite a different picture of the relationship between Mr Donai and his father as the contract work was being done at the family home.
You would be perhaps assisted by being reminded by me of the evidence of Mrs Margaret Urwin and her husband Alan. Each of those two people gave evidence that Mr William Weightman had reported to them that he was not happy with the job.""
91The first complaint is that this last paragraph is factually incorrect. There is no substance to this. Evidence was adduced from Margaret Urwin (the sister of the deceased Mrs Weightman) in cross-examination that Weightman had told her that the appellant had had an argument with her sister and brother-in-law about the stencilling. She also said the deceased's friends, Chris and Alan Williams, 'knew something about it' (the argument). Asked what she knew about the specifics of the argument, Mrs Urwin said: '... I took it to be that Bill wasn't happy and, you know, I wasn't really interested. You know, I didn't really know anything about it, but I think Bill just wasn't happy with the job. I can't extend any more on that, Mr Flynn, because I really don't recall.'
92When asked about the stencilling, in his evidence in chief, Mr Urwin said: '...I do remember I mentioned about the stencilcreting. I actually said it looked quite nice and Bill said he wasn't happy with it.'
93The second complaint, which also has no substance at all, is that her Honour's summing up incorrectly referred to the deceased having been administered Serepax.
94The matter was dealt with correctly by her Honour in the trial when she said:
""There was no Serepax detected on analysis of the body of either of the deceased, Mr and Mrs Weightman.""
95On sentence, however, her Honour mistakenly referred to David Weightman administering Serepax tablets. This factual error in the sentencing remarks was immaterial to the sentence ultimately imposed. The point was that temazepam was found in the system of both Mr and Mrs Weightman. There was evidence that temazepam has the same qualities as Serapax (otherwise known as oxazepam). Both are benzodiazepine drugs having sedative effects used for the short-term management of insomnia in adults. Dr Gall gave evidence that there was at least twice the concentration of temazepam found in Mr Weightman's system during the post-mortem than in Mrs Weightman's system. The concentration of temazepam in Mr Weightman's blood system was 0.20 milligrams per litre ""so"", according to Dr Gall, ""it may cause a degree of sedation, so drowsiness."" On the other hand, Mrs Weightman had much less - less than 0.10 milligrams per litre and too low to quantify and too little to have an effect upon her wakefulness.
96Many complaints are made under ground 12. Some of them concern issues arising in relation to grounds of appeal which I have already considered. Because I am satisfied that the appellant must succeed on ground 2 and a new trial ordered it is unnecessary to consider this ground further. However, as I have indicated I am persuaded that a serious miscarriage of justice arose from the evidence of the conversation with the appellant. Competent counsel should have objected to this evidence which has occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
97Ground 13 is concerned with the unreliability of the evidence of Weightman. His credibility was in issue. The extent to which his evidence could be accepted was a matter for the jury who were given significant warnings about his reliability by the trial judge.
98Apart from the evidence of Weightman there was significant evidence to which I have referred pointing to the appellant's guilt. However, notwithstanding this evidence I am satisfied that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. The appellant is entitled to a trial according to law upon evidence properly admitted at his trial.
99Although the appellant included ground 13 in his notice of appeal his counsel accepted that if a substantive ground of the appeal succeeded the appropriate order would be that there be a new trial.
Sentence
100The appellant also sought leave to appeal against his sentence and sought to raise three further grounds of appeal. As I am persuaded that a new trial is necessary I do not propose to consider these matters further.
ORDERS
1.Appeal against conviction upheld and conviction quashed.2.Order a new trial.
101BLANCH J:  I agree.
102HISLOP J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

		16 April 2012",2011-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757540,Beckett v The State of New South Wales (No. 1) [2011] NSWSC 818,"Judgment 

1The Plaintiff has brought proceedings against the State of New South Wales for malicious prosecution. After the Plaintiff was convicted and was unsuccessful on an appeal, a reference was made under s 474C(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. An enquiry was held by a judge and the matter went back to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That Court ordered a retrial with respect to a number of counts, dismissed the appeal in relation to two counts and directed an acquittal on another count. Subsequently the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to proceed any further on the counts in respect of which a new trial had been ordered. 

2The Defendant filed a Notice of Motion on 16 May 2011 seeking a separate determination in relation to the following questions: 

A. With respect to each of the counts 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 for which the plaintiff was tried: 

i. Accepting that the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff, to the extent that the plaintiff's claim for malicious prosecution is based upon each of these counts, does the plaintiff need to prove her innocence in relation to each count to succeed? 

B. With respect to count 9 for which the plaintiff was tried: 

i. To the extent that plaintiff's the claim for malicious prosecution is based upon this count does the plaintiff need to prove her innocence of the charge? 

3Both parties submitted that I should accede to the Motion to determine the questions separately and in advance of the remainder of the hearing. I agreed to do this. The principal reason for doing so was because the answers to the separate questions would determine what evidence it was necessary and admissible to lead on the hearing of the action. The cases that I shall discuss when dealing with the answers to the separate questions show what evidence is permitted and/or required to be led depending on how it is that the proceedings have terminated in favour of the Plaintiff. 

Background 

4On 24 August 1989 the Plaintiff was arrested and charged in relation to a number of matters. On 14 May 1990 committal proceedings commenced in Taree Local Court in relation to the indictable offences. 

5On 27 July 1990 Magistrate Evans ordered the Plaintiff to stand trial in the Supreme Court in relation to a number of the allegations which subsequently formed the following counts in the indictment presented at the Plaintiff's trial: 

Count 1: [Rock Incident]: 

On 2 May 1988 at Taree maliciously did wound Barry Catt (s.35 Crimes Act 1900). 

Count 2: [False Evidence About The Rock Incident]: 

On 3 July 1989 at Taree in the Local Court before Mr G.P. O'Keefe, Magistrate, on an occasion when truth of the same was material, did knowingly and willingly falsely swear in substance, as follows, that is to say, that she, Roseanne Catt, at no time struck Barry Catt with a rock (s.327 Crimes Act 1900). 

Count 3: [Swan's Crossing Incident]: 

Between 2 March and 30 March 1989 at Swans Crossing maliciously did wound Barry Catt (s.35 Crimes Act 1900). 

Count 4: [Cricket Bat Incident]: 

On 5 May 1989 at Taree did assault Barry Catt thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm (s.59 Crimes Act 1900). 

Count 5: [Drug Incident]: 

Between 1 May and 31 July 1989 at Taree, maliciously did cause to be taken by Barry Catt a noxious thing, namely, lithium, and thereby did endanger the life of Barry Catt (s.39 Crimes Act 1900). 

Count 6: [James Morris - RSL Club]: 

On 28 July 1989 at Taree did solicit James Morris to murder Barry Catt (s.26 Crimes Act 1900). 

Count 7: [Vernon Taylor-1 Cornwall Street, Taree]: 

Between 15 July and 16 August 1989 at Taree did solicit Vernon Taylor to murder Barry Catt (s.26 Crimes Act 1900). 

Count 9: [Pistol]: 

On or about 24 August 1989 at Taree did have in her possession a pistol, namely, a Hopkins and Allen .32 calibre revolver, she then not being the holder of a licence for such pistol (s.25(l) Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973). 

6In addition, Count 8 in the indictment presented at trial was this: 

On or about 24 June 1989 at Taree did encourage Leslie O'Brien to murder Barry Catt (s.26 Crimes Act 1900). 

On that matter the Magistrate did not commit the Plaintiff to stand her trial. Subsequently, however, the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an ex officio Indictment in relation to that count which became Count 8 in the indictment. 

7The Plaintiff stood her trial in relation to the said nine counts before her Honour Justice Mathews and a jury in the Supreme Court. The trial commenced on 7 May 1991. On 11 September 1991 the jury returned verdicts of guilty to counts 1,2,3,4,6,7 and 9, and an alternative guilty verdict in relation to count 5. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty in relation to count 8. On 18 October 1991 the Plaintiff was sentenced to a total of 12 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 3 months. 

8The Plaintiff appealed her convictions and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court subsequently dismissed her appeal ( R v Catt (1993) 68 A Crim R 189). 

9In early 2001 the Plaintiff petitioned the Governor, pursuant to section 474B Crimes Act 1900, seeking a review of her convictions on the eight (8) counts on which she had been found guilty. On 24 July 2001 the Attorney-General referred the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to section 474C(l)(b) Crimes Act 1900. 

10On 7 December 2001 the Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal. In considering the appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal, on 12 July 2002, ordered that the factual issues in the appeal be remitted to a judge of a court of trial, pursuant to section 12(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The matter was allocated to Davidson ADCJ for the determination of factual matters. His Honour delivered his findings on 27 July 2004. 

11On 16 September 2004 the Plaintiff filed Amended Grounds of Appeal. 

12On 17 August 2005 the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered judgment in the appeal: Regina v Catt [2005] NSWCCA 279. McClellan A-JA (with whom Adams J agreed) said: 

[232] I have come to the conclusion that the appeal in relation to counts 3 and 4 should be dismissed and the appeals in relation to counts 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9 upheld. 

[233] With respect to count 9 (unlicensed pistol) the sentence has already been served and an order for a new trial would not be appropriate. A verdict of acquittal should be entered. 

[234] However, with respect to the other matters the charges are serious and although I am satisfied the convictions should be quashed it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, and not this Court, to determine whether a new trial should take place. Although there is undoubtedly significant reasons (sic) why a new trial may be appropriate, not the least of which is to ensure that when significant charges are brought they are determined according to law, this must be balanced with the fact that fresh trials would occasion significant expense and it would be unlikely that any further term of imprisonment would be required to be served, even if convictions were entered on all charges. The appellant was released on bail on 6 August 2001, just over four months before her release on parole was due on 10 December 2001. 

[235] In the circumstances, the appellant should remain on bail pending the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether to proceed with any fresh trial. 

[236] I propose the following orders: 

1. Uphold the appeal in relation to counts 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9 and quash each conviction. 

2. Enter a verdict of acquittal on count 9. 

3. Order that there be a new trial in relation to counts 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. 

4. Dismiss the appeal in relation to counts 3 and 4. 

5. The appellant's bail is to continue. 

6. Reserve liberty to apply. 

13On 22 September 2005 the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that there be no further proceedings against the Plaintiff on all the outstanding charges. On 26 September 2005 a form from the DPP headed ""Particulars of No Further Proceedings Submission to the Director"" (""the Particulars"") was prepared for forwarding to the Court of Criminal Appeal Registry. 

14In the Particulars the question was asked ""Has a Bill been found: Yes No"" and the ""No"" box has been marked with a cross. 

15On the same day the DPP wrote to the Plaintiff in these terms: 

RE: Regina v Yourself 

Offences: Malicious wounding; Perjury; Attempt to cause noxious thing to be taken; Solicit to murder (x2) 

District Court No: 02/12/1052 

I wish to advise that after careful consideration of this case the Director of Public Prosecutions has made the decision to proceed no further with the above charges. 

16The power of the DPP to make the decision was derived from s 7 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 which relevantly provides: 

7 Principal functions 

(1) The principal functions and responsibilities of the Director are: 

(a) to institute and conduct, on behalf of the Crown, prosecutions (whether on indictment or summarily) for indictable offences in the Supreme Court and the District Court, 

(b) to institute and conduct, on behalf of the Crown, appeals in any court in respect of any such prosecution, and 

(c) to conduct, on behalf of the Crown as respondent, any appeal in any court in respect of any such prosecution. 

(2) The Director has the same functions as the Attorney General in relation to: 

(a) finding a bill of indictment, or determining that no bill of indictment be found, in respect of an indictable offence, in circumstances where the person concerned has been committed for trial, 

(b) directing that no further proceedings be taken against a person who has been committed for trial or sentence, and 

(c) finding a bill of indictment in respect of an indictable offence, in circumstances where the person concerned has not been committed for trial. 

The issues 

17In relation to the first question the following issues were argued: 

(1) Whether the forwarding of the Particulars to the Court could be regarded as the entry of a nolle prosequi ? 
(2) If the forwarding of the Particulars amounted to a nolle prosequi , is the result that the Plaintiff must prove her innocence in relation to each count in order to succeed? 

In relation to the second question the following issue was argued: 

(3) In circumstances where the Court of Criminal Appeal acquitted the Plaintiff in relation to count 9 for the reasons it gave, is it necessary for the Plaintiff to prove her innocence to succeed in relation to this count? 

(1) The effect of the forwarding of the Particulars 

18The Plaintiff submits that at the time the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed her convictions the indictment upon which the Plaintiff was charged was spent. That meant, it was submitted, that a new indictment would have to be presented to the Court, and there was no evidence of a new indictment. Since a nolle prosequi may only be entered upon an indictment having been filed, any notification by the DPP to the Court cannot have been the entry of a nolle prosequi . 

19The Plaintiff also points to the statement in the Particulars document saying that no bill had been found. The Plaintiff also submitted that the affidavit detailing its preparation and disposition did not go so far as to show that the document had been communicated to the Court. I will deal with this last submission first. 

20The affidavit was sworn by the Administrative Officer Level 2 in the Office of the DPP responsible for processing directions from the Director. She prepared the Particulars, and when it was completed she placed it in an in-tray to be sent to the Court of Criminal Appeal Registry. She said that the procedure was that the Administrative Officer Level 1 would send the form to relevant parties (including the CCA Registry). 
21The presumption of regularity applies: R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 250, a case also concerned with the DPP notifying the Court. In any event, if the Particulars had not been notified the Plaintiff would have been called upon pursuant to the indictment and the order for re-trial. She was not so called. I am satisfied that the Particulars were in the ordinary course communicated to the Court. 

22The importance of determining whether the DPP's notification is the equivalent of entering a nolle prosequi is that the cases distinguish, for the purpose of the tort of malicious prosecution, between the effect of that act and (for example) a decision of the Attorney-General (now the DPP) not to find a bill of indictment: Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd v Smith (1938) 59 CLR 527 at 543. 

23It will be noted that s 7(2) of the DPP Act does not in terms refer to a nolle prosequi . It speaks in sub-s (2)(a) of the Director ""determining that no bill of indictment be found ... in circumstances where the person concerned has been committed for trial"", and it speaks in sub-s (2)(b) of the Director ""directing that no further proceedings be taken against a person who has been committed for trial"". 

24The position at common law seems to have been that a nolle prosequi could be entered at any time before verdict ""but only after the indictment or information had been presented"": R v Wylie, Howe and McGuire (1919) 83 JP 295; The Queen v Economou (1989) 51 SASR 421; Question of Law Reserved on Acquittal (1996) 66 SASR 450 at 456-457 (this aspect nor affected by the judgment of the High Court on appeal - Director of Public Prosecutions South Australia v B (1998) 194 CLR 566). 

25Subject to the provisions of s 7 of the DPP Act , which I shall discuss presently, the question to be decided is the status of the indictment upon which the Plaintiff was tried. 

26In Howard at 247 the Court of Criminal Appeal said that there were three relevant and available methods of disposal of an indictment. They were ""trial, plea of guilty, or the entering of a nolle prosequi "": see also R v Taylor [2003] NSWCCA 194 at [147]. Accordingly, in R v Janceski [2005] 64 NSWLR 10 at [181] and [221] it was held that where a jury could not agree and the trial judge ordered a new trial the indictment was not spent. 

27In R v Nicholas (1989) 45 A Crim R 299 the indictment upon which the accused was charged contained three counts. At the conclusion of the Crown case the trial judge upheld a submission that the Accused had no case to answer on count 2 and the Accused was acquitted on that count by direction. He successfully appealed against his conviction on the other 2 counts in the indictment. The Court of Criminal Appeal ordered that the convictions on counts 1 and 3 on the indictment be set aside and a new trial held on those counts. Prior to the commencement of the second trial the relevant Crown law officer entered a nolle prosequi on counts 1 and 3 on the indictment, and in due course a further indictment was filed containing eight counts, two of which were similar to counts 1 and 3 in the original indictment. 

28At the commencement of the second trial the Accused moved to quash the indictment (relevantly for present purposes) on the basis that it was formally defective. That submission was made on the basis that the two counts which were similar to counts 1 and 3 in the original indictment had been the subject of the nolle prosequi by the Crown, and it was argued that he could no longer be tried on those counts. The trial judge dismissed the application, and the Accused appealed. 

29The principal judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal was given by Cox J with whom Nettlefold and Wright JJ agreed. Cox J set out the provisions of s 404 of the Criminal Code 1924 (Tasmania) which, in similar but not identical terms to s 8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) ( R v Murrell (2001) 123 A Crim R 54 at [23]), gives power to order a new trial where there has been a miscarriage of justice. He then went on to say this (at 303): 
Prima facie therefore where an appeal against conviction succeeds the court is required not only to quash the conviction but to direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered, thereby terminating all proceedings against the appellant on the indictment and arming him with a clear plea of autrefois acquit to any further proceedings in respect of the same subject-matter. Of course to the extent that any further indictment may allege new issues, not the subject of the first indictment and in respect of which issues the appellant has not hitherto been in jeopardy, that is a perfectly acceptable course (see, for example, Gerakiteys (1984) 153 CLR 317; 12 A Crim R 54) and not one in respect of which the above plea could be maintained. However, if the court sees fit to exercise certain other powers it has, including that of ordering a venire de novo or a new trial, its order will quash the original conviction and will refrain from directing a judgment and verdict of acquittal which would obviously be inconsistent with such an order. Consequential orders under s 404(2) will provide a mechanism for further proceedings upon the only process then before the court, that is the subsisting indictment. Because that is the only document identifying the issues before the court, it is by reference to that document that the court would indicate the issues in respect of which the judgment and verdict of the court should stand, be set aside or remitted to another panel of jurors for retrial. In the present case the verdict of not guilty on count 2 (forgery) was not challenged and had to stand. The court could have dismissed the appeal in respect of one of the remaining counts or upheld it in respect of both, quashing them and directing a verdict of acquittal on one and ordering a retrial on the other or, as was the case here, directing that both remaining counts should be retried. The order conveniently indicated, by reference to the existing indictment, the issues which rather than being concluded by virtue of verdict and judgment and giving rise accordingly to a plea of autrefois acquit should be re-submitted to a court of trial. It in no way in my view prevented the Crown from exercising its non-examinable prerogative power ( Radford [1951] Tas SR 1; Barton (1980) 147 CLR 75) to enter a nolle prosequi on that indictment and to present the accused on a further indictment drafting the issues in a different form and including, where appropriate, any new issues. ( emphasis added ) 

30His Honour then went on to consider the common law position prior to a statutory appeal being available to challenge a conviction by moving using a writ of error. He cited Blackstone where this appears: 

""When judgment, pronounced upon conviction, is falsified or reversed, all former proceedings are absolutely set aside, and the party stands as if he had never been at all accused. ... But he still remains liable to another prosecution for the same offence: for, the first being erroneous, he never was in jeopardy thereby."" 
( Blackstone's Commentaries (1st ed, 1769), Vol IV, p 386), also Chitty and Russell. 

31His Honour then said (at 305): 

This brief survey of the powers and practice of courts of criminal appeal indicates to me that though ordinarily the court will either affirm or substitute the verdict on the record, thereby concluding all issues raised on the indictment upon which the accused took his trial, where the court orders a further trial by virtue of a power to order either a new trial or a venire de novo the verdict on the record of the court of trial will be set aside and the issues raised by the indictment will remain justiciable. It is a mere matter of mechanics whether the new trial proceeds on the same indictment or upon some fresh indictment substituted by an authorised officer of the Crown. In this regard the situation is essentially the same as that contemplated by the Jury Act 1899 (Tas), s 49, where the first trial results in a disagreement or is otherwise aborted. It remains a proper matter for the discretion of a Crown law officer whether to proceed to a further trial at all, notwithstanding the apparently mandatory order for a new trial, and equally a matter of discretion whether or not to proceed with the count charged or some other one upon which the appellant could have been convicted on the first indictment. One can easily imagine cases where, despite an order for a new trial on an indictment alleging murder, the Crown may think it proper to proceed only with an allegation of manslaughter. ( emphasis added ) 

32Two important matters emerge from this judgment. The first is, where the Court of Criminal Appeal has quashed the convictions and ordered a new trial the issues raised by the indictment upon which those counts were tried will remain justiciable, and they may be tried on the same indictment. In this regard, the position of a jury disagreeing, as in Janceski, is analogous. 

33The second is, as happened in Nicholas , the appropriate Crown law officer was entitled to, and did, enter a nolle prosequi in relation to the first indictment. 

34Accordingly, in the present case when the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the convictions on these counts and ordered a new trial, the indictment upon which the Plaintiff had been tried remained extant and was not spent. In those circumstances, the decision of the DPP not to proceed further on the charges amounted to the entry of a nolle prosequi within common law principles. 

35It is necessary, also, to look at the provisions in s 7(2) of the DPP Act to see how those provisions accord with the common law procedure of entering a nolle prosequi. 

36In R v Howard at 249 the Court of Criminal Appeal said of s 7 of the DPP Act : 

When the language of s 7(2)(b) is considered in the context of the whole section, and is compared with that of s 7(2)(a), it can be seen that it is sufficiently wide to cover the function of entering a nolle prosequi upon an indictment that has already been prescribed. It is not limited to that function, but that is included. It would also include giving such a direction for the purpose of clearing the way for proceedings on a different charge. Accordingly, we accept the submission that the Director had power, in the present case, to direct that no further proceedings be taken against Morgan upon the indictment presented on 2 October 1990, and that such a direction would have the same effect as the entering by the Attorney-General of a nolle prosequi . The question is whether such a direction was given. 

37In R v GKA (1998) 99 A Crim R 491 at 494 Cole JA (with whom Gleeson CJ and Barr J agreed) said this of s 7: 

The power to direct a nolle prosequi is the same as one power referred to in ss 7(2)(a) and 27(a) of the DPP Act. A determination of a ""no bill of indictment"" would not prevent the bringing of a further indictment. The substance of the power contemplated by ss 7(2)(b) and 27(b) is wider than a nolle prosequi because it constitutes a direction that no further proceedings be taken against a person who has been committed for trial or sentence. Nonetheless, the power conferred by s 7(2)(b) includes a power to require entry of a nolle prosequi . It is not necessary in this proceeding to further define the scope of the power conferred by s 7(2)(b). 

38Both Howard and GKA take the view that the function of entering a nolle prosequi is contained as part of the power within sub-s (2)(b). Since the terms of the DPP's notification to the Court follow the wording in sub-s (2)(b) the DPP was, in my opinion, entering a nolle prosequi as was discussed in Davis v Gell (1994) 35 CLR 275 and Smith . That conclusion rests on my earlier conclusion that the first indictment was not spent and was still extant. 

39The notation in the Particulars forwarded to the Court that no bill had been found is of no consequence. It does not alter the fact that the indictment upon which the Plaintiff had been tried was still extant. Even if the DPP was considering whether another bill of indictment should be found, it was necessary to bring the previous proceedings to an end: Nicholas at 303 and 305. 

40If I am wrong in my view that the first indictment was not spent, GKA appears to take the view that the finding of no bill of indictment in sub-s (2)(a) is also the equivalent of entering a nolle prosequi . The reason given is that a determination of a ""no bill of indictment"" would not prevent the bringing of a further indictment. 

41GKA does not advert to the distinction made in Smith (which I shall discuss in more detail when dealing with the effect of a nolle prosequi ), between the effect for the tort of malicious prosecution of the entry of a nolle prosequi on the one hand and the decision not to find a bill of indictment. On one view that is hardly surprising because that was not the issue in GKA . Nevertheless, if the end result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's orders to quash the convictions and order a retrial meant that the matter was back at the stage of the Director considering whether or not to find a bill of indictment, the statement in GKA , that the power to direct a nolle prosequi was the same as one power referred to in sub-s 7(2)(a), would suggest that the common law position that determined when a nolle prosequi can be entered has been modified. In other words, a decision by the DPP not to proceed before a bill of indictment was found or presented will now be regarded as the entry of a nolle prosequi . 

42For these reasons, the notification to the Court by the DPP on or after 26 September 2005 was the equivalent of the entry of a nolle prosequi . 

(2) The effect of entering a nolle prosequi 

43In Davis v Gell the trial judge on an action for malicious prosecution directed the jury that because a nolle prosequi had been entered in the criminal proceedings in favour of the Plaintiff the jury should assume that the Plaintiff was innocent. The correctness of that direction was the only issue on the appeal to the High Court (see at 279). 

44Isaacs ACJ first discussed the elements of the tort of malicious prosecution. In respect of the element that the criminal proceedings must have terminated favourably to the Plaintiff, he said this (at 286): 

In Steward v. Gromett , which is a landmark in the development of the action, the principle was clearly established - obviously on the broadest ground of inherent justice - that, where a judicial determination of innocence was impossible by reason of the form of proceeding, the plaintiff was not bound to produce such a termination. It follows necessarily from the principles adverted to that a nolle prosequi entered by the prosecuting authority on its own responsibility and discretion creates a position in which an accused person, afterwards plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution, may properly say the proceeding was not capable of a complete termination in his favour by way of acquittal. But though so far absolved, it does not follow that the termination by way of nolle prosequi in any way establishes innocence. ""The effect of a nolle prosequi when obtained"" ( Chitty's Criminal Law , vol. i., p. 480) ""is to put the defendant without day, but it does not at all operate as an acquittal."" (And see R. v. Mitchell ) Its evidentiary effect depends on other considerations, to which I shall later advert. 

45A little further in his judgment he said this (at 292): 

Acquittal connotes (a) termination of the proceedings and (b) innocence of the accused. Nolle prosequi connotes the first only. This effect it must have on the civil action. But innocence in that case still remains to be proved in order to maintain the action and cannot be assumed. This is strongly exemplified in Bank of New South Wales v. Piper . 

46Gavan Duffy J said (at 294): 

I agree with the other members of the Court in thinking that in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff must prove his innocence, and that proof that a nolle prosequi was entered on his trial does not entitle the jury to assume that the plaintiff was innocent. 

47Starke J said (at 297): 

[The Plaintiff] may show, for instance, that the proceedings terminated in his favour by a nolle prosequi or by the ignoramus of a grand jury or by the refusal of a justice to commit for trial, or by some want of jurisdiction in the Court or some technical defect in the indictment or information, and so forth. Proof of these facts would show that the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff, but they do not establish the innocence of the plaintiff, and the burden is upon him in the first instance to make out his case. 


( Ignoramus of a grand jury is the present equivalent of the refusal of the Attorney-General or the DPP to find a bill of indictment.) 

48In Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd v Smith (1938) 59 CLR 527 the Plaintiff had been committed for trial on a charge of conspiracy with 3 other persons to cheat and defraud shareholders and policy holders of the Commonwealth Life Assurance (Amalgamated) Association. He was committed for trial by the Magistrate but the Attorney-General decided that no indictment should be filed (see at 532). The joint judgment set out (at 532) the issue for determination by the High Court as follows: 

At the trial of the action under consideration in this appeal the plaintiff insisted that he was entitled to lead evidence to establish affirmatively that he was innocent of the conspiracy with which he had been charged and for that purpose to prove many matters, such as what he had been informed or believed and what circumstances or alleged circumstances actuated his conduct, all of which would have been inadmissible if the issue of his guilt or innocence were out of the case. The defendant objected, and maintained that the question of the actual guilt or innocence of the plaintiff formed no part of the issues before the jury. The trial judge, on the authority of the judgments given in this court in Davis v. Gell , admitted the evidence. There can, we think, be no doubt that, if this course was erroneous, then, having regard to the nature of the evidence so admitted, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. The contention that no substantial wrong or miscarriage would be occasioned by the error appears to us to be quite untenable. 

The first question for consideration, therefore, is whether the plaintiff's guilt or innocence of the charge was in issue. The affirmative of this question is supported on the part of the plaintiff on the ground that his innocence is an element essential to his cause of action and also a matter going to damages. These are, of course, separate reasons for throwing open before the jury in the civil proceeding the question with which the criminal proceeding was concerned. We shall deal first with the question whether the plaintiff's guilt or innocence is an issue going to the cause of action. 

49The joint judgment then discussed the statement of Bowen LJ in Abrath v North Eastern Railway Co. (1883) 11 QBD 440 at 455 that in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff has to prove that he was innocent and that his innocence was pronounced by the tribunal before which the accusation was made. They then discussed what had been said in Davis v Gell , saying (at 533-534): 

After an elaborate examination of the decided cases by Isaacs J. and by Starke J., those learned judges arrived at conclusions which appear to us to be substantially the same and in which, as we understand his judgment, Gavan Duffy J. concurred. Their Honours considered that in every action of malicious prosecution the plaintiff must show that the charge was ""unfounded,"" and that meant that he must show his innocence. But if he had been tried and acquitted, this would establish his innocence for the purpose of an action for malicious prosecution. It would also show that the criminal proceedings had terminated and thus satisfy another requirement indispensable to the maintenance of the civil action. That requirement might be satisfied by other forms of termination short of acquittal, but they would not establish innocence, at all events conclusively, Starke J. stated the position as follows:- ""He may show, for instance, that the proceedings terminated in his favour by a nolle prosequi , or by the ignoramus of a grand jury, or by the refusal of a justice to commit for trial, or by some want of jurisdiction in the court, or some technical defect in the indictment or information, and so forth. Proof of these facts would show that the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff, but they do not establish the innocence of the plaintiff, and the burden is upon him in the first instance to make out his case. It is unnecessary, and indeed undesirable, in this case, to discuss what (if any) presumptions in favour of innocence, or other evidence would satisfy the burden"". 

50The joint judgment then continued (at 534-535): 

In expressing the view that the dismissal by a magistrate of an information for an indictable offence or the ignoring of a bill of indictment by a grand jury was insufficient to exclude or conclude the question of the plaintiff's guilt or innocence of the charge, the court went beyond the particular case which, as we have already said, was one where after the plaintiff had been put on his trial a nolle prosequi was entered on behalf of the Crown. Now the question whether a nolle prosequi is a sufficient termination of the criminal proceedings to enable the accused to maintain an action of malicious prosecution, assuming that he can establish the other elements in the cause of action, is one which has never been settled by English authority. A nolle prosequi does no more than bring the trial to an end. The accused may again be indicted or fresh process may be awarded in the same indictment and the prisoner again put on his trial. 

... 

The development by an action on the case in the nature of conspiracy of the remedy for malicious prosecution was perhaps somewhat late and relatively slow. The elements of the cause of action did not become definite and certain before the nineteenth century and it is evident that there has survived to the present time a difficulty in the application of principles, otherwise settled, to the special case of proceedings brought to an end by nolle prosequi . The view adopted in Davis v. Gell covered that difficulty and solved it by leaving the question of innocence or guilt open for inquiry in the civil proceedings. But the opinion expressed by the members of the court that proceedings which ended in favour of the accused by a refusal of the magistrates to commit fell under the same rule was unnecessary to the decision, and, in view of the unreported case in the Privy Council, Balbhaddar Singh v. Badri Sah (No. 66 of 1924), it cannot now be followed. 

51A little further on the joint judgment said this (at 541-543): 

As Isaacs J. explains in Davis v. Gell , Bowen L.J. did not mean that innocence must be proved and acquittal also. He meant that a decision in favour of the accused must be proved, which decision thus established innocence. When he said that the plaintiff must prove first, that he was innocent and that his innocence was pronounced by the tribunal before which the accusation was made, he used words which cover discharge by a magistrate, the ignoring of a bill of indictment and a judgment of acquittal after a verdict of not guilty. He appears to us to have meant no more than is meant by the statement of Byles J. in Basebe v. Matthews which we have quoted. 

... 
Unless the termination of the criminal proceedings has been by nolle prosequi , a case which is covered by the decision of Davis v. Gell , the cause of action in malicious prosecution does not depend upon the actual innocence of the plaintiff. The plaintiff must prove that the prosecution terminated in his favour. He must prove that there was no reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. But he need not prove that in truth he was innocent of the charge, and it is not open to the defendant to attempt to prove as an answer to the action that in truth he was guilty, notwithstanding the termination of the criminal proceedings in his favour. 

... 

Except in the case of a nolle prosequi covered by the decision in Davis v. Gell , we are of opinion that the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff is not an issue going to the cause of action in malicious prosecution. 

The present case is not one where the proceedings were terminated by the entry of a nolle prosequi . They ended by the refusal of the Attorney-General to file an indictment. Under the law of New South Wales there is no grand jury, and the Attorney-General discharges a duty analogous to or replacing that which, under the common law, was performed by a grand jury. See sec. 5 of 9 Geo. IV. c. 83; Crimes Act 1900, sec. 572, and Justices Act 1902-1931 N.S.W., secs. 39, 41 (6) and 42, and R. v. McKay , to which Rich J. has referred us. When an accused person is committed for trial, it is for the Attorney-General to consider whether the accused should be put on his trial and for what precise offence, and this he does by filing or refusing to file an indictment. This is an entirely different function from that of entering a nolle prosequi upon an indictment after it has been filed, which does no more than non. pros. the indictment. The decision in Davis v. Gell was upon the effect of a termination by the latter process and both on principle and upon the authority of the decision of the Privy Council in Balbhaddar Singh v. Badri Sah it cannot be extended further. ( emphasis added ) 

52This last paragraph contains the important distinction to which I have made reference earlier. 

53The Plaintiff submits that the jurisprudence contained in Davis v Gell has now been superseded, that it does not represent the present state of the law, and that I should not follow it. The Defendant points to what was said more recently by the High Court in A v State of New South Wales [2007] HCA 10; (2007) 230 CLR 500 in the plurality judgment at [1]: 

This appeal raises issues concerning two of the four elements of the tort of malicious prosecution. For a plaintiff to succeed in an action for damages for malicious prosecution the plaintiff must establish: 

(1) that proceedings of the kind to which the tort applies (generally, as in this case, criminal proceedings) were initiated against the plaintiff by the defendant; 

(2) that the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff; 

(3) that the defendant, in initiating or maintaining the proceedings acted maliciously; and 

(4) that the defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause. 

54The Plaintiff submits that the enunciation of those elements of the tort shows that the issue of the innocence of the Plaintiff is not an element of the tort. The Plaintiff points also in that regard to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Miazga v Kvello Estate [2009] SCC 51; [2009] 3 SCR 339 at [3]: 

To succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must prove that the prosecution was: 

(1) initiated by the defendant; 

(2) terminated in favour of the plaintiff; 

(3) undertaken without reasonable and probable cause; and 

(4) motivated by malice or a primary purpose other than that of carrying the law into effect. 

55I do not think that anything said in A v State of New South Wales casts any light on the present issue. That was a case, as the joint judgment makes clear at [2], which was concerned with the third and fourth elements of the tort which the Court identified. So, too, was Miazga. 

56Further, neither Davis v Gell nor Smith was referred to in A v State of New South Wales . In any event, the submission with regard to Davis v Gell seems to overlook the approval given to what it decided in respect of a nolle prosequi in Smith , even though statements made in it going beyond that point were seemingly disapproved. 

57How the innocence or otherwise of the Plaintiff fits into the elements of the tort was comprehensively explained in Smith in the passages that I have set out earlier. It forms part of the element of the proceedings terminating in favour of the Plaintiff. The acquittal, the refusal to commit for trial, or the refusal of the Attorney-General to find a bill of indictment, proves the innocence of the Plaintiff. Because the filing of a nolle prosequi is not a final determination of the indictment it does not determine the innocence of the Plaintiff. 

58The Plaintiff submitted that Smith was a difficult case to understand because it was not clear how the prosecution was terminated. Reference was made to an associated case of Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd v Brain (1935) 53 CLR 343. That was a claim for malicious prosecution by a co-accused with Smith. Mr Blackett SC for the Plaintiff drew my attention to the portion in the judgment of Evatt and McTiernan JJ (at 399) where it was suggested that the prosecution came to an end by the filing of a nolle prosequi . Further, the summary of the facts under the headnote in Smith make a similar statement. However, it seems clear from the judgment in Smith itself that the proceedings came to an end by the Attorney-General deciding not to file an indictment (see at 532 and 543). 

59The Plaintiff submits that the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Mann v Jacombe (1961) 78 WN (NSW) 635 is inconsistent with Davis , and that I should follow Mann v Jacombe in preference to Davis . 

60The judgment in that case was very succinct with the essence of the decision on the issue in dispute being found in the first two of four paragraphs as follows: 

The defendant, Jacombe, who is being sued by the plaintiff, Mann, for alleged injury suffered through Jacombe's issuing criminal proceedings against him, demurred to each of the four counts of the plaintiff's declaration. He submitted that the declaration does not allege the termination of the proceedings referred to in each count in the plaintiff's favour, and that the entry of a nolle prosequi is not a termination of proceedings in favour of the defendant (Mann) in the criminal case. 

All that need be said on the point is to refer to the decision in 1891 of the Full Court of New South Wales in Gilchrist v. Gardner (1891), 12 L.R. (N.S.W.) 184, from which it appears that the balance of the decisions in America, as well as in Australia, is to the effect that a nolle prosequi is a sufficient ending of the prosecution. See also Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd. v. Smith (1938), 59 G.L.R. 527; and cf. Davis v. Gell (1924), 35 C.L.R. 275. In the result, the objection to the declaration by the defendant fails in respect of each count. 

61It does not seem to me that Mann v Jacombe is inconsistent with Davis . Mann v Jacombe says nothing about the need of a plaintiff to prove his or her innocence. It dealt simply with the question of whether the entry of a nolle prosequi was a termination of proceedings in favour of the plaintiff. Indeed, in the passage from the judgment of Starke J (which I have set out at para 47 above) he expressly says that the Plaintiff may show that the proceedings terminated in his favour by a nolle prosequi but then goes on to say that proof of that did not establish the innocence of the Plaintiff. That view was reaffirmed in Smith in the passage that I have set out in para 51 above. In any event, the question I am determining has as its introduction the words ""accepting that the proceedings terminated in favour of the Plaintiff"". 

62Two other decisions fortify me in the conclusion to which I have come in relation to the effect of the filing of a nolle prosequi. In Skrijel v Mengler [2003] VSC 270 Nettle J at [223] set out a passage from Fleming, The Law of Torts (LBC, 9 th Ed, 1998) at 679 dealing with the element of favourable termination in favour of the plaintiff, where the following appears: 

Even the mere discontinuance of a prosecution or the entry of a nolle prosequi after an indictment had once been filed may now, despite some earlier doubts, be regarded as in every way sufficient. 
63Nettle J went on to say: 

[224] It seems to me, however, that the law in this country is not so simple. In Davis v Gell a majority of the High Court held that a nolle prosequi was not enough to establish that the proceeding had terminated favourably to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had also to prove that he was innocent of the offence with which he was charged. Flemming (sic) says that the decision in Davis v Gell may safely be discounted in light of Commonwealth Life Assurance v Smith , and that the decision in Mann v Jacombe establishes that the entry of a nolle prosequi after an indictment has been filed is in every way sufficient. I do not see how that can be correct. 

[225] Davis v Gell was a case in which a nolle prosequi was entered after the plaintiff had been committed to stand trial and had pleaded not guilty to the indictment. The High Court held by majority that in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff had to prove his innocence. The nolle prosequi established that the proceedings were terminated in his favour but that did not establish his innocence. 

[226] Commonwealth Life Assurance v Smith was not concerned with a nolle prosequi . The Court was concerned with the attorney general's refusal to file an indictment, and the majority held that: 

"" Unless the termination of the criminal proceedings has been by nolle prosequi, a case which is covered by Davis v Gell , the cause of action in malicious prosecution does not depend upon the actual innocence of the plaintiff."" (My Emphasis). 

As I read that decision it expressly preserves the effect of Davis v Gell in its application to cases of nolle prosequi . 

[227] That being so, I do not understand how any decision other than another decision of the High Court could be thought to alter the position. Whatever the depth of learning in the decision in Mann v Jacombe may have been it could not have the effect of altering a decision of the High Court. Until the High Court says otherwise, the law in relation to nolle prosequi remains as in Davis v Gell . 

[228] Moreover, it does not appear to me that the court in Mann v Jacombe did purport to decide anything contrary to Davis v Gell . Mann v Jacombe was about pre Judicature Act pleading in New South Wales. The point at issue was whether the plaintiff against whom the criminal proceeding was non pros had to plead innocence. It was held that he did not. The court said only that: 

""...it appears that the balance of decisions in America, as well as in Australia, is to the effect that a nolle prosequi is a sufficient ending of the prosecution."" 

[229] Perhaps Mann v Jacombe says something inferentially about what the plaintiff would later have to prove at trial. But I do not think it has to be taken that way. The decision in Davis v Gell was that it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove his innocence, not that he had to plead it, and as Starke J noted in Davis v Gell that had long been the law: 

""But it is 'not necessary in an action for malicious prosecution that the plaintiff should allege or prove such an acquittal, for it may be brought under circumstances which preclude the possibility of such and acquittal' (Selwyn's Nisi Prius , 13th ed, Vol II, p105). He may show, for instance; that the proceedings terminated in his favour by a nolle prosequi or by the ignoramus of a grand jury or by the refusal of a justice to commit for trial, or by some want of jurisdiction in the Court or some technical defect in the indictment or information, and so forth. Proof of these facts would show that the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff, but they do not establish the innocence of the plaintiff, and the burden is upon him in the first instance to make out his case."" 

I see no necessary inconsistency as between that and what was held in Mann v Jacombe . 

[230] In the course of final addresses the first and third defendants provided me with references to a number of American authorities on the question of nolle prosequi in the law relating to malicious prosecution and it was submitted on the basis of those authorities that, despite the decision in Davis v Gell , a nolle prosequi is only to be regarded as a favourable termination of the criminal proceeding if the reasons stated for the nolle are ""consistent with the innocence of the accused"" rather than for ""procedural or technical defect"". For the reasons already given I do not consider that it is open to me to adopt that course. I regard myself as bound by Davis v Gell . 

64With great respect to Nettle J, I do not agree with his Honour's statement that the point at issue in Mann v Jacombe was whether the Plaintiff had to plead innocence. Nothing in the short judgment suggests that that is so. The issue was, as the first paragraph of the judgment makes clear, that the declaration did not allege the termination of the proceedings referred to in each count in the Plaintiff's favour, and that the entry of a nolle prosequi was not a termination of the proceedings in favour of the Plaintiff. I note also that the passage from Starke J's judgment which he quoted was disapproved in Smith except to the extent that it referred to a nolle prosequi . 

65However, I respectfully agree with Nettle J's conclusion that Mann v Jacombe is not consistent with Davis v Gell and, like Nettle J, I am of the opinion that until the High Court says otherwise the law in relation to nolle prosequi and the tort of malicious prosecution remains as in Davis v Gell , and I would add, as approved in Smith . 

66In Noye v Robbins and Crimmins [2007] WASC 98 Heenan J said: 

[238] What, then, is the significance in entering a nolle prosequi for an accused person who subsequently brings an action for malicious prosecution against the person or persons who originally instituted or instigated the charges? Plainly, such an accused person is powerless to achieve a more favourable outcome. He or she cannot compel, even if they wished to do so, the trial to proceed. Still less, can a judgment, after a verdict by a jury or by a Judge alone, be entered in the hope that the accused would be vindicated by an acquittal. Such a person can do nothing more than accept the termination of the proceedings as a demonstration that the person or authority who originally had the responsibility of proving the charge has decided not to attempt that task. 

[239] Both defendants in the present action originally submitted that the entry of the nolle prosequi on the indictments presented against Noye did not constitute a favourable termination of the proceedings and that, consequently, these actions must fail because of the inability of Noye to establish that those proceedings terminated in his favour. However, counsel for Inspector Robbins abandoned that point in final submissions (see written submissions par 55). For this proposition the defendants had relied upon Davis v Gell (supra); and Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd v Smith (1938) 59 CLR 527; and the very recent discussion of those decisions by Nettle J in Skrijel v Mengler (supra) which distinguished the later decision, apparently to contrary effect, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Mann v Jacombe (supra). 

[240] In Davis v Gell (supra), the court held that in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff must prove his innocence. The fact that a nolle prosequi was entered at his trial, although it establishes that the proceedings terminated in the plaintiff's favour, does not establish the plaintiff's innocence, whereas a verdict of acquittal does establish innocence as well as demonstrate that the proceedings terminated in favour of the accused. In Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd v Smith (supra), an action for malicious prosecution was brought following a charge of conspiracy made against the plaintiff in respect of which the Attorney General, after the plaintiff had been committed for trial, had declined to file any indictment. There was no nolle prosequi because there had never been an indictment. At 543, Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said: 

Except in the case of a nolle prosequi covered by the decision in Davis v Gell [supra], we are of opinion that the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff is not an issue going to the cause of action in malicious prosecution. 

and, further, at 545: 

For the reasons already given, the basis of the action puts out of consideration any question of actual guilt. The failure of the proceedings brought by the defendant, the absence of any reasonable cause and malice are the grounds. 

and, at 544: 

In other words, for the purpose of malicious prosecution, the law should consistently treat the question as disposed of in the criminal proceedings, the propriety of the conclusion of which ought not to be canvassed. 

This has left a controversy, and a conflict in subsequent decisions below the level of the High Court, about whether or not the filing of a nolle prosequi is a sufficient basis for maintaining an action for malicious prosecution and, if so, whether the plaintiff must additionally prove that he is innocent of the charges laid. The older authorities, and the controversy as it then stood, were discussed in detail by a helpful article by Donovan G P, "" The Effect of a Nolle Prosequi in Relation to the Action for Malicious Prosecutio n"" (1939) 12 ALJ 457; but there have been significant other decisions since then. 

[241] I consider that Davis v Gell (supra) demonstrates that, in any action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must establish the falsity of the charge complained of and must do so by showing his innocence. In cases where the plaintiff was acquitted after trial (whether on facts or because of any technical defect or inadequacy in the indictment or the charge), that acquittal is to be treated as the establishment of innocence. However, without such an acquittal, because a nolle prosequi was filed, that is not conclusive evidence of innocence and it is still for the plaintiff to prove that by other means in the subsequent civil action. By contrast, in Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd v Smith (supra), the court held that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove innocence of the charges brought against him or her. Nevertheless, it did not overrule or reject the decision in Davis v Gell (supra) that in a case involving the filing of a nolle prosequi it remained for the plaintiff to establish his innocence by some additional means, leaving the issue of guilt or innocence open for inquiry in an action for malicious prosecution brought after the filing of a nolle prosequi . An obvious point of difficulty emerging from Smith's case (supra) is that if the entry of a nolle prosequi is an insufficient termination of proceedings for the purposes of an action for malicious prosecution, then to allow affirmative proof of innocence in the civil action to supply that deficiency is to proceed upon the assumption that the rule requiring favourable termination of criminal proceedings requires proof of the plaintiff's innocence - a proposition inconsistent with the rejection of the relevance of guilt or innocence of the plaintiff in Smith's case (supra) itself. The inconsistency becomes apparent when one considers the previously long accepted view that the importance of the termination in the plaintiff's favour is not that he or she is innocent but that he or she has not been convicted: see Salmon and Heuston on the Law of Torts , (2000) 20th ed (1992) at 412; Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 18th ed [16]-[19]. 

[242] In Smith's case (supra) the court referred to the old decision of Goddard v Smith (1704) 6 Mod Rep 261; (1704) 87 ER 1007, and concluded that it did not support the proposition that an action for malicious prosecution could not be brought following a nolle prosequi ; and was some authority for the proposition that the effect of the nolle prosequi may not be to discharge any further prosecution upon an indictment, but simply to put off the defendant sine die, with the possibility that a new process might issue upon an offence. From this it can be concluded that the entry of a nolle prosequi constitutes as much of a favourable termination as, from their nature, the criminal proceedings were capable of producing in the events which happened; and that it terminates the immediate indictment and must therefore be regarded as putting an end to that particular prosecution without foreclosing the possibility of another. This is because the procedure adopted by the prosecution precludes the possibility of a judicial determination, so that it would be unjust that the plaintiff should be prevented from bringing an action for malicious prosecution - see Steward v Gromett (1859) 141 ER 788, cited in Davis v Gell (supra) by Isaacs ACJ at 286 and, by observations to similar effect, by Starke J at 297. 

[243] Furthermore, the law treats the termination of criminal proceedings because of a defect in the indictment or because of want of jurisdiction of the court as sufficient to justify an action for malicious prosecution even though such cases will usually be as, if not more, equivocal of the innocence of the accused than a discharge after a nolle prosequi . If, as Smith' s case (supra) has held, in all instances but discharge following a nolle prosequi , in the subsequent action for malicious prosecution the actual guilt or innocence of the plaintiff is an irrelevant issue, that would appear to be because the action for malicious prosecution requires the plaintiff to establish that the original prosecutor did not have reasonable and probable cause for bringing the charge. Conviction of the person charged after trial (not set aside on appeal) will, of necessity, render proof of the absence of reasonable and probable cause impossible. However, the action for malicious prosecution will still lie following the discharge of the accused after a successful appeal following a conviction at trial because, in that case, the proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff's favour. Although, in such a situation, it might be expected to be difficult to establish, as a fact, the absence of probable and reasonable cause for laying the charge. 

[244] In Mann v Jacombe (supra), Evatt CJ, Herron and Sugerman JJ decided that the entry of a nolle prosequi constituted sufficient favourable termination of proceedings to maintain an action for malicious prosecution. The case was decided upon a demurrer which cited, and purported to apply, both the decisions in Smith's case (supra) and Davis v Gell (supra). Similarly, in Earnshaw v Loy (No 1) [1959] VR 248 at 249, Sholl J said, of Smith's case: 

That case and other cases now appear to establish clearly that, except where there is a nolle prosequi, the favourable determination of the criminal proceedings cannot be controverted in the subsequent civil action, at any rate as a separate issue. 

[245] In Skrijel v Mengler (supra) at [227], Nettle J referred to the express observation of the decision in Davis v Gell in Mann v Jacombe and then said: 

Whatever the depth of learning in the decision in Mann v Jacombe may have been it could not have the effect of altering a decision of the High Court. Until the High Court says otherwise, the law in relation to nolle prosequi remains as in Davis v Gell. [Citations omitted] 

Nettle J then went on to distinguish Mann v Jacombe as being concerned with the niceties of pre- Judicature Act pleading in New South Wales, where it was only necessary for the plaintiff to prove his innocence at trial and not to plead it. His Honour then referred to American authorities which had held that a nolle prosequi should only be regarded as a favourable termination of the criminal proceedings if the reasons given for the nolle were consistent with the innocence of the accused, rather than for a procedural or technical defect. Her (sic) Honour did not adopt that approach. 

[246] While, for reasons of principle, I am disposed to favour the approach taken by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Mann v Jacombe (supra), I am mindful of the need to conform strictly with the binding authority of the High Court and, therefore, with Davis v Gell and Smith's case (supra), to decide that proof of the filing of a nolle prosequi is insufficient, by itself, to establish the termination of the criminal proceedings in the plaintiff's favour. Therefore, I need to consider whether or not there is other evidence which, taken in combination with the filing of the nolle prosequi , proves, on the balance of probabilities, the innocence of the plaintiff which, otherwise would be assumed from a verdict of acquittal. 

67The issue concerning nolle prosequi and the innocence of the Plaintiff were not issues on the appeal from this decision: Noye v Robbins and Crimmins [2010] WASCA 83. 

68I have read the very interesting article (referred to in Noye v Robbins) by G P Donovan at 12 ALJ 457 discussing the correctness or otherwise of Davis v Gell . Although a number of valid points are made about the effect of a nolle prosequi generally and in relation to the tort of malicious prosecution, those are matters which would ultimately need to be put to the High Court if ever an appropriate case reaches that Court. I consider myself bound to apply the law as enunciated in Davis v Gell as approved and modified in Smith . That law is that although the entry of a nolle prosequi will not mean that the proceedings have not terminated favourably to the Plaintiff, it leaves the issue of innocence of the Plaintiff undecided in a way that other forms of termination of the criminal proceedings, including the refusal or determination of the Attorney-General or DPP not to find a bill of indictment, do not. 
69The result is, in my opinion, that a nolle prosequi has been entered in relation to the criminal proceedings against the Plaintiff, but that means that the Plaintiff must prove her innocence of the charges in the present proceedings in relation to counts 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. 

Count 9 

70The Defendant submits that the acquittal in relation to count 9 was not based on the merits of the charge but was granted on discretionary grounds. The Defendant points to what was said by the Court at [233] (para 12 above). On that basis, the Defendant submits that the decision should be regarded analogously to the entry of a nolle prosequi , with the result that the Plaintiff needs to prove her innocence in relation to that charge. 

71In my opinion, these submissions should not be accepted. For whatever reason the Court of Criminal Appeal directed that a verdict of acquittal on count 9 be entered. Further, the High Court made clear in Smith that the decision in Davis v Gell concerned only the effect of entering a nolle prosequi, and said that the decision could not be extended further both on principle and on the authority of the decision of the Privy Council in Balbhaddar Singh v Badry Sah (PC No. 66 of 1924). The only circumstance where innocence must be proved is where the proceedings terminated by the entry of a nolle prosequi . 

Conclusion 

72For the above reasons I answer the separate questions asked as follows: 

A. Yes. 

B. No.

		05 August 2011",2011-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757541,State of New South Wales v Doherty [2011] NSWCA 225,"Judgment  1HODGSON JA: By proceedings brought in the Supreme Court, the respondent (Mr Doherty) sued the appellant State of New South Wales (SNSW) for damages for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alleged to have been caused by negligence and/or breach of statutory duty by SNSW, which had employed him as a police officer.  2On 20 May 2010, Price J gave a verdict and judgment for Mr Doherty in the sum of $753,676.85, arrived at after he had reduced the damages by 35 per cent by reason of Mr Doherty's contributory negligence: Doherty v State of New South Wales [2010] NSWSC 450.  3SNSW appeals from that decision.  Mr Doherty has put on a cross-appeal, challenging the primary judge's decision as to contributory negligence.  Outline of facts  4I will commence with an outline of the facts not in dispute or clearly proved.  5Mr Doherty was born in 1963, and was sworn in as a police officer in 1985.  6During 1987, having been involved in a motor car incident for which he was accused of culpable driving, he received counselling from the Police Psychology Unit.  7In January 1988, he commenced full-time duties with the Forensic Services Group (FSG), in the course of which he was required to attend numerous crime scenes involving death and/or serious injury.  8One such occasion was in 1994, where he attended a crime scene where a woman and her three children had had their throats cut.  9Around that time he was promoted to senior constable.  In February 1996 he completed a peer support course, and was appointed a Peer Support Officer.  The course dealt with PTSD in some detail.  10Further horrific crime scenes attended included the scene of the De Gruchy murder (March 1996), a plane crash in Kosciusko National Park in which six people were killed (April 1998), the O'Hearne murder (June 1998), and the Arkell murder (June 1998).  11There were group debriefings after some of these occasions.  Mr Doherty's evidence, accepted by the primary judge, was that he experienced feelings of extreme fear, helplessness and horror from these incidents, and had flash-backs following these incidents.  By 1998 to 1999 he was abusing alcohol fairly regularly as a coping mechanism.  These matters were not reported by him to the police service.  12In 2000, an FSG Welfare Committee was created, to better organise the welfare of FSG staff.  Mr Doherty was part of that group.  In that year also, Mr Doherty was promoted to detective sergeant.  13On 9 April 2001, Mr Doherty completed psychometric testing organised by the Police Service.  It was noted that he was ""likely to be under-reporting psychopathology"" (1 Blue 162).  It appears that this note was not followed up.  14On 10 December 2001, Jennifer Lette, a psychologist employed by SNSW, visited Wollongong FSG and spoke to Mr Doherty among others, reminding them of the services available via the Psychology Section.  This happened again on 5 February 2003.  15On 25 February 2002, Mr Doherty consulted with his GP Dr Harvey, reporting that he had not been feeling himself and was getting headaches (1 Blue 210-211).  Although at the time he was ""having like nightmares and stuff"", he did not report this to Dr Harvey (1 Black 124).  16On 25 June 2002, Mr Doherty completed further psychometric testing.  On this occasion, there was no reference to under-reporting and no other particular problem noted.  17On 29 April 2003, Mr Doherty separated from his first wife.  Shortly afterwards, he commenced seeing Leisa Etherton, who later became his second wife.  There were around this time acrimonious dealings with his first wife.  Mr Doherty informed his supervisor Detective Sergeant Hodder about threats from his first wife; and Detective Sergeant Hodder arranged for Mr Doherty to see a psychologist Marion Bloom (who was not an employee of SNSW).  18Mr Doherty saw Ms Bloom on 19 May 2003.  Her assessment of his problems recorded a score of 4 (extreme) for work stress and for marital/ relationship problems (breakdown/ separation/ divorce).  Her notes do not suggest that anything was said about flashbacks, nightmares or the like (1 Blue 237-239).  19Mr Doherty was then off work from 20 May 2003 to 4 June 2003.  On 20 May 2003 Detective Sergeant Hodder emailed Ms Lette that Mr Doherty was having worrying problems on the domestic front (3 Blue 1057).  20On 27 May 2003, Mr Doherty again consulted his GP Dr Harvey.  Dr Harvey's notes indicate that he diagnosed depression related to marital difficulties, but the notes also record ""anxious at work"" (1 Blue 211).  When Mr Doherty saw Dr Harvey on 3 June 2003, Dr Harvey's diagnosis was ""depression getting better"".  Similar notations were made from visits on 17 June 2003 and 29 October 2003.  21Following his return to work on 4 June 2003, Mr Doherty attended further distressing crime scenes in 2003, and this continued until May 2004.  During this time, according to Mr Doherty's evidence, he was suffering nightmares and unable to return to sleep after waking, was taking shortcuts at crime scenes, and had become very anxious (1 Black 35).  22On 27 May 2004, Mr Doherty was diagnosed by Dr Harvey as having PTSD.  He was then off work as per Dr Harvey's medical certificates until 13 September 2004 (1 Blue 213, 265).  23On 27 May 2004, Mr Doherty gave an Accident/ Injury Notification to SNSW, attaching Dr Harvey's certificate diagnosing PTSD, and describing ""the incident"" as ""Multiple Traumatic Incidents Experienced as a Crime Scene Investigator attached to Forensic Services"" (1 Blue 263-264).  Mr Doherty subsequently submitted a Claim for Hurt on Duty Benefits form on 4 June 2004 (1 Blue 266-269).  24On 28 May 2004, Mr Doherty had a further consultation with Ms Bloom.  Her notes record ""not travelling well w/work"" and ""feeling lousy since 12 months - been trying to make it look like he's alright"" (1 Blue 240-241).  When cross-examined about this note, Mr Doherty accepted that he had known there was something wrong with him, and that he knew that if his boss knew this he would be unable to continue doing his work (1 Black 192-193).  25On 1 June 2004, Mr Doherty again consulted Dr Harvey.  Dr Harvey's notes record that Mr Doherty was relieved now he was doing something about PTSD (1 Blue 213).  There were further consultations on 11 June 2004, 24 June 2004, 16 July 2004, 30 July 2004 and 30 August 2004.  26Sometime before 24 June 2004, Mr Doherty had another consultation with Ms Bloom.  Her notes record ""dream/ nightmares - a few but much better"", ""edgy"" and ""flashbacks about jobs - most at night - don't last long"" (1 Blue 242-243).  27Around this time, Mr Doherty commenced living with Leisa Etherton; and on 7 July 2004, both Mr Doherty and Ms Etherton saw Ms Bloom.  Her notes record that he was ""feeling better"" (1 Blue 244).  28On 8 September 2004, Mr Doherty had a further consultation with Dr Harvey.  His notes record:  ""Feels the best he has for the last 18 months.  Wants to go back to work.  Had been getting dizzy spells so went back to 2 Cipramils a day.  Has not had any dizy (sic) spells on the 2 Cipramil.  Sleeping well.  Feeling ing (sic) happy.  Has not had any flash backs since 30 th /7 th 2004.  Has not seen the psychologist for 3 weeks.  Has discussed going back to work with boss and he can go back on reduced duties, with no on call work.  However, according to evidence given by Leisa Doherty, this was entirely contrary to her observations of Mr Doherty (1 Black 234).  29On the same day, Dr Smith (a colleague of Dr Harvey) certified Mr Doherty as fit for suitable duties from 13 September 2004 to 14 October 2004, seven and a half hours per day and two days per week (1 Blue 277).  30Mr Doherty then returned to work on reduced hours; but after a short time he was working normal hours.  According to evidence given by Leisa Doherty, he was vomiting before he went to work, and she begged him not to go to work (1 Black 228).  31Mr Doherty took two hours sick report on 13 September 2004 and again on 14 September 2004; was on sick report from 22 September to 26 September 2004; was on annual leave from 27 September 2004 to 5 October 2004, and he took nine and half hours leave on 14 October 2004, after which he had four consecutive rest days.  He attended a fatal industrial accident on 20 October 2004, and was off work for three rest days following it (1 Blue 98).  32On 26 October 2004 his Commander Mark Sweeney referred Mr Doherty to the New South Wales Police Medical Officer (PMO), seeking advice in relation to Mr Doherty remaining in his area of the FSG (1 Blue 279).  33An email dated 28 October 2010 sent to Ms Lette by Mr Sweeney records that Mr Sweeney had seen Mr Doherty who had PTSD; and that Mr Sweeney was ""not sure how [he] is travelling""; and that he had declined any form of rehabilitation through ""our"" rehabilitation officer.  34On 28 October 2004, Mr Doherty had a further consultation with Dr Harvey, whose notes record (1 Blue 215):  ""Has been good at work ... yesterday morning told by commander that he and Stephen Hodder had to see the [PMO] to see if they are fit to continue in their jobs.  Barry was shocked and distressed ...""  35On 1 November 2004, Ms Lette sent an email to one Tania Rogers, a psychologist attached to the same police medical office as the PMO Dr Li (1 Blue 285):  I have read the referral for Barry Doherty.  Barry is a member of the Forensic Services Group.  He is clearly unwell and suffering from a PTSD.  FSG has asked for an opinion about Barry's fitness for work within the FSG.  Given the degree of Barry's illness and the type of work he performs, I think that a Psychiatric assessment is advisable.  I also think that a report should be obtained from his treating doctor and if available, any independent reports obtained by the HOD Section should also be obtained.  As assessment by a Police Psychologist is probably unnecessary if a psychiatric assessment is obtained.  36On 5 November 2004, Mr Doherty recommenced full duties.  37On 9 November 2004, Mr Doherty had another consultation with Ms Bloom.  Her notes (1 Blue 246) record that he was ""feeling good"".  38On 23 November 2004, Mr Doherty was examined by the PMO Dr Li.  Dr Li's report (1 Blue 283) included the following:  Sergeant Doherty confirmed the information as above.  He indicated that he currently did not suffer with any significant psychological symptoms.  He believed he could remain onto his full operational duties at FSG.  Despite there was risk of exposing to crime scenes' materials, Sergeant Doherty believed he could cope with them without any impact on his psychological condition.  After he had returned to full operational duties in 10-2004, Sergeant Doherty did not have any problem with his duties or symptoms.  There was no significant psychological finding during the assessment.  The report asserted that Mr Doherty could remain on his current duties; that he needed to see his treating medical doctors regularly, say about once a month; and that if his psychological condition relapsed, he probably needed to have an opinion from a psychiatrist.  39In his evidence, Mr Doherty said that on that day he was extremely anxious because he didn't want to lose his job, but he was travelling quite well (1 Black 38).  40Mr Doherty took annual leave from 15 December 2004 to 9 January 2005, and was on sick report for the following three days.  He was on leave again from 19 February 2005 to 20 March 2005:  in evidence he said it became obvious he wasn't travelling the best again (1 Black 39).  Between then and 17 May 2005, Mr Doherty attended a number of distressing scenes; and he finally ceased active duties on 17 May 2005 (1 Blue 102-103).  41On 28 June 2005 he was seen by Renata Cimino, a Police Psychologist.  On 1 July 2005 Ms Cimino sent an email to Dr Li, expressing concerns about Mr Doherty's emotional well-being should he return to the same work, and recommending that he undergo a psychiatric assessment (1 Blue 313-314).  42On 5 July 2005, Dr Li reported to Mr Sweeney that Mr Doherty was suffering with psychological symptoms, that treatment was required, that prognosis was guarded, and that Mr Doherty was not fit for any duties which would expose him to crime-scene materials in the FSG (1 Blue 315-316).  43On 22 November 2005, Mr Doherty saw a psychiatrist Dr Michael Prior, who reported giving a diagnosis of chronic mild PTSD on a background of obsessive compulsive personality traits, with the PTSD being caused by multiple traumatic incidents experienced over the course of his career working in the forensic department of the Police Service.  Mr Doherty was not fit to perform operational police duties, and although his symptoms had improved somewhat on psychological treatment, it was unlikely that they would remit fully in the future (1 Blue 326-238).  44Mr Doherty did not thereafter return to work, and is significantly disabled by PTSD.  45These proceedings were commenced in 2008, alleging negligence by SNSW and also breaches of statutory duty.  Decision of primary judge  46The primary judge recounted the history of Mr Doherty's career in crime-scene investigation (pars [14]-[85]) and his subsequent history (pars [86]-[97]).  He discussed the psychiatric and psychological evidence before him, including that of a psychiatrist Professor McFarlane, who gave evidence for Mr Doherty, and Professor Tennant and Dr Brown, psychiatrists who gave evidence for SNSW (pars [98]-[133]); and considered Mr Doherty's credit (pars [134]-[139]) finding him overall to be a genuine witness.  47The primary judge then considered when was the onset of Mr Doherty's psychological injury (pars [140]-[149]), finding that it began in 1994.  48The primary judge considered SNSW's duty of care (pars [150]-[160]) finding that it had a non-delegable duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing Mr Doherty to unnecessary risks of injury, including a duty not merely to provide a safe system of work but to maintain and enforce such a system.  49The primary judge considered whether there was relevantly a foreseeable risk of injury (pars [161]-[167]); and found there was a foreseeable risk of psychological injury to Mr Doherty from his work of crime-scene investigation; and that the probability of psychological injury to him was of a high order and the psychological injury was likely to be serious.  50The primary judge then considered the system that had been in place to deal with the risk (pars [168]-[174]).  51He then considered whether SNSW's duty was breached before 2003 (pars [175] to [202]).  The primary judge had earlier referred in par [164] to a memorandum dated 12 May 1999 by Ms Lette and Mr Mutton to Dr Raymond, Director Forensic Services, recommending annual review of crime-scene examiners by way of interview, use of psychometric tests, site visits by psychologists and brief annual feedback about each employee to their Commander; and the primary judge gave his conclusion as to breach before 2003 as follows:  202 A reasonable person in the position of the police force would not have partially implemented the Lette and Mutton recommendations. The recommended system of annual reviews of each crime scene investigator by way of an interview and psychometric testing was a reasonable response to the high risk of psychological injury to them. Without an annual review by way of an interview with a psychologist, the systems which the police force had in place were not a reasonable response to the high risk of psychological injury. This was one way in which the defendant breached its duty of care to the plaintiff in 2003. Another way was in 2001 by failing to act upon the indications of under-reporting in the plaintiff's 2001 MMPI-2 assessment. In these circumstances, a reasonable person in the position of the police force would have ensured that the plaintiff was clinically interviewed by a psychologist. The third complaint of breach of duty is, in my opinion, established. The breaches of duty, which I have identified fall within the particulars of negligence quoted at [3] above.  52Next, the primary judge considered whether SNSW's duty was breached during 2003 (pars [203]-[213]).  He reviewed the submissions of counsel, and then continued:  207 As has been recounted at [41-42] above, the plaintiff had been referred through the EAP [Employee Assistance Program] to Ms Bloom. The psychologist rang Dr Harvey who saw him on 27 May 2003. Dr Harvey diagnosed depression and prescribed Cipramil. The plaintiff was placed off work from 20 May 2003 until 4 June 2003. On the day before he returned to work, Dr Harvey considered the plaintiff's mood was ""6/10"" and his depression was getting better. The plaintiff then returned to crime scene investigation work but was taking Cipramil which had been prescribed at 20mg once a night. The plaintiff next consulted Dr Harvey on 17 June 2003 whose diagnosis was ""depression better"" but the dosage of Cipramil increased from one 20mg a night to one and a half 20mg a night. The dosage of Cipramil was reduced to one 20mg a night by Dr Harvey on 29 October 2003 who recorded that the ""depression [was] going okay"". It seems that, other than these consultations with his general practitioner, the plaintiff's diagnosed depression was not otherwise monitored. The plaintiff was not reviewed by Ms Bloom until May 2004 nor was there any communication between Dr Harvey and the police force.  208 Although there was discord between Professor McFarlane and Professor Tennant upon whether the plaintiff should have been returned to crime scene work whilst on medication, all of the experts agreed that his prognosis should have been closely monitored. Dr Brown opined that she probably would have trialled him back at work but would have kept ""a very close eye on him because of the concern that he might relapse"". Very careful monitoring after May 2003 involved reviewing him regularly probably once a month or a fortnight. She considered that, as depression increased vulnerability to the effects of exposure to gruesome scenes, his return to work should have been on restricted duties for several months before he trialled himself on crime scene attendance. In this respect there was little difference between the opinions of Dr Brown and Professor McFarlane who considered that the plaintiff could return to work full-time ""but for a period of time he should have been withheld from crime scenes.""  209 Whilst Professor Tennant was of the view that the plaintiff could return to work with some symptoms, he said the general practitioner, psychologist and police force would be aware of ""keeping a close eye on him.""  210 The plaintiff had not fully recovered when he returned to work on 4 June 2003. It is of no consequence, in my view, that the cause of the diagnosed depression may have been considered to be as a consequence of his marital difficulties. The plaintiff was in fact experiencing nightmares and flashbacks of ""jobs that he had been to previously"" but he had not told his general practitioner of them. A significant degree of triggered distress remained. He was vulnerable to relapse and at the very least required close monitoring. He was neither psychometrically tested nor clinically interviewed by a psychologist from the Police Psychology section or elsewhere. He was not referred to the PMO.  211 It is evident that the police force was aware of the increased risk of psychological injury by returning FSG officers who had developed psychological symptoms to crime scene investigation work. Superintendent Philip Flogel states (ex 31):  ""Crime Scene officers suffering from psychological symptoms who are supported by their treating doctors in returning to work, are wherever possible, provided with restricted or alternative duties within FSG.""  212 No consideration, it appears, was given to placing the plaintiff on restricted duties.  213 The guideline for annual psychometric testing was not followed at all in 2003 in the plaintiff's case. Superintendent Flogel gave evidence that if an officer was unavailable to be tested for reasons such as court duty or leave, the officer would be followed up to ensure that the annual test was undertaken. The evidence does not disclose why the plaintiff was not tested. I do not accept Mr Menzies's submission that the plaintiff had been diagnosed with depression and as a consequence the screening test was otiose. As the plaintiff had developed psychological symptoms from which he had not fully recovered and was vulnerable to relapse and psychological injury, reasonable precautions against the foreseeable high risk of psychological injury included placement on restricted duties, psychometric testing and a clinical interview by a psychologist before he was returned to crime scene investigation duties. Upon his return to these duties, the plaintiff should have been closely monitored. Unfortunately, he was not. In these circumstances, a reasonable person in the position of the police force would have taken those precautions and in failing to do so, the police force breached its duty of care to the plaintiff. The breaches of duty which I have identified fall within the particulars of negligence quoted at [3] above.  53The primary judge then considered whether SNSW's duty was breached during 2004 (pars [214]-[237]); and he found a number of breaches:  1. Dr Li's use in 23 November 2004 of a DASS screen (a test for depression and anxiety disorders) to test Mr Doherty, rather than a PCL test (a test for detection of post-traumatic stress disorder);  2. Dr Li's failure to refer Mr Doherty for an independent review by a psychiatrist;  3. Failure to bring the contents of Ms Lette's email of 1 November 2004 to the attention of Dr Li; and  4. Failure to closely monitor Mr Doherty after Dr Li certified him as fit for full operational duties.  54The primary judge then considered the question of causation (pars [238]-[253]).  Having referred to the Civil Liability Act 2002 s 5D and the submissions of the parties, he continued:  242 I am not at all persuaded by the defendant's submission that psychometric testing and an interview by a psychologist would not have revealed anything due to the plaintiff's reticence to disclose his symptoms. During the interview with Ms Bloom on 19 May 2003, the plaintiff had partially disclosed issues he was having at work which, regrettably, was not followed up by another psychological interview before he was further exposed to crime scenes.  243 In the circumstances of this case, it is unnecessary to attempt to resolve the disagreement between Professors McFarlane and Tennant on the concept of kindling. But for the breaches of duty during 2003 the plaintiff would not have returned to crime scene work on 4 June 2003. He was traumatically confronted with the death by suicide of the girl at Chevalier College and the death of the elderly pedestrian in November 2003 at a time when he was experiencing nightmares and anxiety. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these traumatic exposures would not have occurred but for the plaintiff's return to crime scene work and but for the defendant's failure to closely monitor him after he had returned to work.  244 There was no disagreement between Professors McFarlane and Tennant as to the impact that exposure to traumatic events might have upon the plaintiff who had prior symptoms of PTSD. Professor Tennant referred to ""chronicity."" Re-exposure to more and more traumatic events meant that initial symptoms would not recover, they were likely to get worse and become chronic. Professor McFarlane on this topic gave the following evidence (T 261 L 17-29):  ""Q. Is it your opinion that him continuing in crime scene investigation work after May 2003 has played a part in his current condition?  A. Yes.  Q. What sort of part?  A. In my opinion, his subsequent relapse occurred for exactly the reasons that I have suggested previously. He was obviously exposed to events in their own right which could cause post traumatic stress disorder, but because he had previously been disordered and equally had major depression, these events simply undid the benefits that he gained from treatment. They reinstituted the disorder of affect and arousal which he was experiencing previously.""  245 I accept Professor McFarlane's view that the plaintiff would still be working full-time if he had been taken out of crime scene investigation work in the middle of 2003 and had been provided with appropriate treatment. I find as a matter of fact that the identified breaches of duty in 2003 significantly contributed to the chronicity and severity of the plaintiff's PTSD and major depression. I find that it is appropriate for the scope of the defendant's liability to extend to ""the harm so caused.""  246 But for the defendant's breaches of duty during 2004, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff would not have been certified as being fit for full operational duties in November 2004. I find that it is more likely than not that an independent psychiatric assessment of the plaintiff and testing for PTSD by use of the PCL would have disclosed that he was unwell and suffering from PTSD. The plaintiff was traumatically confronted with the murder-suicide at Oak Flats on Anzac Day 2005 and within a few weeks thereafter the apparent suicide of a young man in bushland near Berry at a time when he was experiencing nightmares and anxiety. But for the plaintiff's return to crime scene work and but for the defendant's failure to closely monitor him after his return to work, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these traumatic exposures would not have occurred. I accept Professor McFarlane's opinion that had the plaintiff been removed from the FSG in November 2004, his outcome would have been different and that he would still have the capacity for employment, probably within the police force. I find as a matter of fact that the identified breaches of duty during 2004 substantially contributed to the chronicity and severity of the plaintiff's PTSD and major depression. I find that it is appropriate for the scope of the defendant's liability to extend to ""the harm so caused.""  247 There is no merit in the defendant's contention that the precipitant for the PTSD in May 2004 was not work-related and as a consequence there was no breach. This submission was founded upon Ms Bloom's notes on 28 May 2004 of a loss of ""2 friends in a car crash on Friday"" and Dr Brown's opinion that ""possibly the incident of the cousin's suicide and possibly the incident of the friend's motor vehicle accident were causally related to the plaintiff's PTSD"". The notation that follows the entry of the 'car crash' in Ms Bloom's notes, however, records that the plaintiff was ""feeling lousy since 12 months - been trying to make it like he's allright (sic)."" Dr Brown, furthermore, testified that it was difficult to be definitive about this issue and that there was a long list of traumatic exposures during the course of the plaintiff's work over the years outlined in the statement of claim. I accept Professor McFarlane's evidence that there were multiple traumatic events that contributed to the plaintiff's PTSD and it is not possible to identify a single event. I have no doubt that the traumatic exposures in November 2003 contributed to his PTSD and depression.  248 The defendant's breaches of duty before 2003, in my opinion, also contributed to the occurrence of the plaintiff's PTSD and depression. I do not accept that if the defendant had acted upon the indications of under-reporting in the plaintiff's 2001 MMPI-2 assessment and ensured that he was clinically interviewed by a psychologist that nothing would have been revealed. As I have previously observed, the plaintiff made a partial disclosure of work-related issues to Ms Bloom in May 2003 and I have little difficulty concluding that it is more probable than not that a clinical interview by a police psychologist conversant with the 2001 MMPI-2 assessment would have uncovered the plaintiff's traumatic memories, nightmares and sleep difficulties. Professor McFarlane expressed the opinion that an appropriately trained clinician would be likely to see through expressions of wellness by a police officer. Police psychologists were well aware of the tendency of police officers to minimise their symptoms and, in my view, it is unlikely that a police psychologist would have been confuted by the plaintiff's reticence to disclose his psychological problems. But for the defendant's breach of duty in 2001, the plaintiff would not have been further exposed to traumatic crime scenes without having undergone psychological treatment.  249 Another issue requires consideration. The defendant argued that whilst there was a risk of potential exacerbation or aggravation of PTSD by further exposure to traumatic events, there is no evidence that the duration of the pre-existing disorder influences the post-treatment outcome. This is the issue of ""entrenchment"" which has been discussed at [129(ii)] above. On this topic, Professor Tennant said (T 416 L 33-42):  ""Now, once treatment is implemented, there is no evidence that the exposure to those previously recurring events affects your ability to respond to treatment. Nor does the chronicity, pre-treatment chronicity affect whether you get better or not. Now, that's the literature I have provided to you about, does duration of pre-treatment chronicity affect final treatment outcome. The literature says - I can't find any literature that does support that and I have provided that review, so the Court - and indeed I think Professor McFarlane - will - will get confused between treatment resistance and chronicity and will keep talking about more events make you chronic, they do, but once treatment begins you either are the sort of person who is a treatment responder or you are not.""  250 Professor McFarlane was on the other hand of the view that as the disorder becomes entrenched, the underlying neurobiological abnormalities become progressively inflexible and unresponsive to treatment.  251 Whilst there is some research which supports Professor Tennant's views on entrenchment, the issue is far from settled. I have difficulty accepting in the plaintiff's circumstances that the delay in his treatment has not impacted upon his treatment outcome. In any event, it seems to me that it makes little difference which of the opinions on entrenchment is accepted. According to Professor Tennant a person is either a treatment responder or is not. Dr Durrell, the plaintiff's treating psychiatrist, was not of the opinion that his patient fell within the group of persons who are treatment non-responders. He said this (T 351 L 24-30):  ""Q. In relation to the treatment that you have been providing to him, has he improved?  A. He - I note there's been talk of him not responding. My understanding is that my treatment has been effective in containing his symptoms to a degree and, without treatment, I would anticipate an escalation and a deterioration so in a sense we're holding the line and I consider that to be a treatment response.""  252 Dr Brown did not consider the plaintiff to be a treatment non-responder. She was of the opinion that there remained a number of treatment opportunities for the plaintiff and his prognosis was not as grim as it would currently seem to be. The question of his prognosis is considered at [304-305] below.  253 Having made these findings, I consider it to be unnecessary to consider the asserted breaches of statutory duty.  55I note that the reference in par [243] to a disagreement on the concept of ""kindling"" concerned the nature and degree of circumstances required to sensitise (provide ""kindling"" for) a person to respond adversely to a later traumatic event, leading to PTSD.  Having regard to the highly traumatic nature of the scenes and events to which Mr Doherty was exposed over his whole career as a crime scene investigator, the primary judge said he did not have to resolve this particular disagreement; and there is no challenge brought on that matter.  56The primary judge then considered the question of contributory negligence (pars [254]-[270]).  He found that Mr Doherty was guilty of contributory negligence:  264 The plaintiff, however, told Ms Bloom during the consultation on 28 May 2004 that he had been feeling ""lousy for 12 months"" and had been trying to make it look as if he was alright. In cross-examination, he accepted that he knew that there was something wrong with him but continued with his work. I find that when the plaintiff returned to work on 4 June 2003 he was aware that he was continuing to experience nightmares and flashbacks, all of which were work-related, but he failed to tell his general practitioner, Ms Bloom, Detective Sergeant Hodder or the police psychologists of these problems. I accept that he did not do so because he enjoyed his work, was fearful that he may lose his position in the FSG and furthermore did not wish to let his colleagues down. The plaintiff disguised the fact that he was unwell so that he could continue to work. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff, in all the circumstances, knew there was a risk that his psychological problems would intensify if he continued with crime scene investigation work. After all, he had endeavoured to cope for some years but his nightmares and flashbacks had become more frequent. The risk of serious harm was not insignificant.  265 Although one might initially be sympathetic to the plaintiff's motivation in not exposing his symptoms, it is, as I have pointed out at [201] above, of fundamental importance to the criminal justice system that a crime scene investigator carries out his important functions without being affected by psychological injury. The shortcuts that the plaintiff ultimately found himself taking demonstrate the potential difficulties that might arise. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, in the circumstances, a reasonable person in his position would have disclosed his psychological problems. This was a precaution that the plaintiff could simply have taken particularly when he consulted Dr Harvey in June and October 2003 or by arranging to see Ms Bloom or a police psychologist. In failing to do so, he failed to take reasonable care for his own mental health.  266 I should add that the plaintiff's experience of nightmares and flashbacks commenced well before he saw Dr Harvey on 25 February 2002. In the passage of evidence I have quoted at [34] above, he testified that he was ""having nightmares and stuff like that"" but said nothing about his difficulties to the doctor. It is unnecessary, in my view, for the plaintiff to have known of the nature and extent of PTSD. He could not have understood that his nightmares and other difficulties were otherwise than work related. In failing to tell Dr Harvey of his psychological problems, the plaintiff failed to take reasonable care for his own mental health.  267 The submission that regard should be had to the 'police culture' has, in my opinion, no merit. The initiatives undertaken by the police force to overcome the reticence of police officers to disclose their psychological difficulties included the peer support program and the Welfare Focus Group. The plaintiff had himself encouraged his fellow officers to discuss their problems. I, furthermore, reject Mr Doherty's contention that the plaintiff had in reality no choice but to accept the circumstances in which he had to work.  268 By failing to reveal his psychological problems, the plaintiff exposed himself to crime scenes after he returned to work in 2003 when he knew he was unwell. The traumatic exposures which followed would not have occurred but for his conduct.  269 When the plaintiff returned to work on 8 September 2004 on reduced hours he had been previously diagnosed with PTSD. Upon returning to work, he struggled to cope and was physically sick before attending work. I find that he knew that he had not recovered from PTSD but deliberately chose to hide his symptoms. He misled his general practitioner and commanding officer. The information which he gave to Dr Li was intentionally untrue. The plaintiff could neither have honestly held the belief that he could cope with exposure to crime scene materials without impact on his psychological condition nor understood that he was not having problems after his return to full operational duties. He could not have lacked insight or have been mistaken about these matters. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, notwithstanding the plaintiff's desire to remain at work, that in the circumstances a reasonable person in his position would have disclosed his psychological problems to his general practitioner, PMO or commanding officer. This was a precaution he simply could have taken. He failed to take reasonable care for his own mental health.  270 By failing to reveal his true position and by being misleading the plaintiff made it particularly difficult for the medical practitioners, psychologists and supervisors to help him. The plaintiff negligently exposed himself to crime scenes in 2003 and 2004. The traumatic exposures which followed would not have occurred but for this conduct. I find as a matter of fact that his negligence contributed in a significant way to the chronicity and severity of his PTSD and major depression. Nevertheless, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff's contribution to the harm that he has suffered is more than that of the defendant. I do not propose to retell here the defendant's breaches of duty save to say that one consideration is that the defendant knew of the reluctance of crime scene investigators to reveal personal psychological difficulties which might arise from their work and the plaintiff's reticence to disclose his symptoms was reasonably foreseeable. I assess the extent of the reduction in damages by reason of the plaintiff's contributory negligence to be thirty five per cent.  57The primary judge considered whether Mr Doherty's claim was statute-barred (pars [271]-[283]); and he ordered that the limitation period be extended up to and including 13 March 2008, the date on which the statement of claim was filed.  58The primary judge then considered damages (pars [284]-[341]).  He rejected the contention of SNSW for deduction of that proportion of damage which SNSW had not caused, noting that the percentage deduction for vicissitudes in assessment of future economic loss included the chance that Mr Doherty would have suffered his illness in any event (par [287]).  He reviewed Mr Doherty's disabilities and his prognosis, and assessed his non-economic loss at 37 percent of a most extreme case, giving $175,000 (par [306]).  59The primary judge awarded past wage loss in accordance with Mr Doherty's claim at $178,771.04 (pars [317], [324]); and future economic loss on the basis of $1,404 net per week for 13 years less 15 percent vicissitudes, giving $599,449 (par [325]).  He allowed $21,877.25 for past loss of superannuation benefits, $74,055.35 for future loss of superannuation benefits, $15,021.15 for past treatment expenses, $83,892.12 for future treatment expenses and $11,436.95 for interest.  The total damages of $1,159,502.86 were then reduced by 35 percent for contributory negligence.  Issues on appeal  60SNSW relies on the following grounds of appeal:  1. His Honour's finding that the appellant was in breach of its duty during and from 2003 was wrong in that his Honour erred:  (a) in fact in not finding that the Respondent had been screened and interviewed during 2003; and  (b) in finding that it was not reasonable to return the Respondent to work in 2003 whilst still symptomatic and using prescribed antidepressants; and  (c) in finding that there was a failure to closely monitor him upon his return to work in June 2003.  2. His Honour's finding that the Appellant was in breach of its duty during and from 2004 was wrong.  His Honour erred:  (a) in not finding that the failure to provide Dr. Li (PMO) with an email from a police psychologist (Lette) was not unreasonable; and  (b) his Honour applied a test which was too onerous, namely, that a reasonably competent police force, by its PMO, Dr Li, would have referred the Respondent to a psychiatrist; and  (c) in not finding that it was not unreasonable to return the Respondent to crime scene work as at September 2004 in the circumstances; and  (d) in not finding that the psychological monitoring of the Respondent was not unreasonable.  3. His Honour was wrong to find that the concept of a non-delegable duty of care was relevant in determining breach.  4. His Honour was wrong to find that any breach by the Appellant caused the Respondent's psychological injury.  His Honour should have found that:  (a) his injury was materially contributed to by the Respondent's duties but not in circumstances where the Appellant was in breach of duty to the Respondent; and  (b) insofar as the Respondent's injury developed, it did so not because of any breach of duty by the Appellant but because of the Respondent's failure to take care of his own safety.  5. In the alternative to 4 , his Honour's finding on contributory negligence that the extent of the respondent's contribution was 35% was wrong.  His Honour should have found that the respondent's contribution because of his own contributory negligence was 100% or a figure approaching that.  6. His Honour erred in not resolving the issue of whether repeated exposure to traumatic events resulted in entrenchment of the disorder because the resolution of that issue was a necessary pre-condition to deciding whether delay in treatment affected outcome.  7. His Honour's finding that delay in treatment affected outcome was wrong.  His Honour should have found that delay in treatment:  (a) had no effect upon the outcome for the Respondent; and  (b) delayed any effect of treatment but did nothing more than that.  8. ....  9. His Honour's finding that the respondent's psychological injury/ disorder would have been detected by a psychiatrist had he been referred to a psychiatrist was wrong.  Such a finding was glaringly improbable in the light of his Honour's findings of contributory negligence.  10. His Honour's finding as to damages was wrong in as much his Honour should have allowed for the fact that part of the Respondent's psychological injury was not caused by any breach of duty by the appellant and would have existed regardless of that breach of duty.  11. In light of his Honour's findings on contributory negligence, his Honour was wrong to find that it is appropriate for the scope of the Appellant's liability to extend to the harm so caused.  12. His Honour was wrong not to increase the allowance for adverse vicissitudes to take account of the Respondent's pre-existing psychological injury.  61Mr Doherty relies on the following grounds of cross-appeal:  1 His Honour's finding of contributory negligence (35%) was wrong.  His Honour ought to have found no contributory negligence on the part of the cross-appellant.  2 Alternatively, if there was any contributory negligence it was much less than 35%.  3 His Honour erred in finding that the traumatic exposures would not have occurred ""but for"" the respondent's conduct.  4 His Honour erred in applying the ""but for"" test in determining the issue of contributory negligence.  62I will consider in turn the following issues:  (1) Finding of negligence (appeal grounds 1 - 3).  (2) Causation (appeal grounds 4, 9 and 11).  (3) Not resolving contested medical evidence (appeal grounds 6 and 7).  (4) Not allowing for uncaused damages (appeal grounds 10 and 12).  (5) Contributory negligence (appeal ground 5, cross-appeal).  Negligence  63A very general submission made by Mr Menzies QC for SNSW was that it was extremely difficult to detect the onset of a problem like PTSD with someone who is not being frank, with the wish of continuing employment; that the liability of SNSW found by the primary judge in substance lay in SNSW's failure to recognise that Mr Doherty was deceiving it; and that Mr Doherty's injury was in substance caused by his own negligence, that being what caused him to be exposed to the traumatic crime scenes which caused his PTSD.  This general submission was relevant to the question of negligence (Mr Menzies in effect said that the primary judge required too high a standard of SNSW, in expecting it to have recognised Mr Doherty's deception of it); to the question of causation; and to the question of contributory negligence.  64SNSW did not suggest that there was error by the primary judge in his finding at par [202] of breaches prior to 2003, although it did contend that this was not causative of any damage.  65As regards the findings of negligence in 2003, Mr Menzies submitted that it was not a breach in 2003 not to screen and interview Mr Doherty.  This was because his need for monitoring had been picked up and, to SNSW's knowledge, he was seeing Dr Harvey and Ms Bloom; and, contrary to the primary judge's view, he did not need to be put on restricted duties, he did not need psychometric testing, and a clinical interview with a psychologist before returning to crime scene investigations was unnecessary because of his interview with Ms Bloom in May 2003.  Furthermore, any need to be closely monitored was not suggested by Dr Harvey or Ms Bloom, against whom no complaint is made (particularly in circumstances where the substantial problem identified was on the domestic front rather than being work-related, and it was not shown that SNSW knew of the diagnosis of depression).  However, Mr Menzies did concede that SNSW should have known of this diagnosis, through the monitoring by a psychologist reporting to SNSW that should have occurred.  66As regards findings of negligence in 2004, Mr Menzies submitted that, in circumstances where Dr Li was aware that Mr Doherty had been diagnosed with PTSD, the email from Ms Lette would not have provided him with any relevant information.  It was not a breach of duty for Mr Li not to have referred Mr Doherty to a psychiatrist, as he was himself a medical practitioner who well understood the circumstances in which police officers in the FSG worked, and the risks of psychological injury including PTSD.  Mr Doherty's own expert Professor McFarlane did not consider such referral necessary, and Dr Brown considered that Dr Li's conduct was reasonable.  There was nothing unreasonable in the way Mr Doherty was admitted back to work, and he was sufficiently monitored on his return.  67Mr Menzies submitted that the fact that SNSW's duty was non-delegable had no relevance to the case.  68I accept that last submission, but I do not think there was any consequent error by the primary judge.  69In my opinion, no error has been demonstrated in the findings of breach by the primary judge.  In my opinion the primary judge was correct to hold that SNSW should have foreseen a significant risk of psychological injury to officers involved in crime scene investigation; that it should have foreseen that this psychological injury could be very serious indeed; and that a reasonable response required a high standard of monitoring such officers, which took into account that some of them would be likely to be seeking to disregard or minimise any symptoms in order to continue to fulfil their commitments.  70In those circumstances, it was in my opinion well open to the primary judge to find breach by SNSW in failure to follow up the under-reporting finding of April 2001, and breaches before 2003 and in 2003 in not providing an annual review by a psychologist reporting to SNSW:  indeed, ultimately this was not disputed.  Accordingly, it was well open to the primary judge to find that the duty to provide such a review was not discharged by Mr Doherty's consultations with his GP Dr Harvey or with Ms Bloom:  those persons were not particularly attuned to the need to address the possibility of psychological harm arising from crime scene investigations, and they did not report to SNSW.  The diagnosis of depression made in respect of Mr Doherty, at least, would have been known to SNSW if it had provided appropriate psychological review; and this would have been enough to require monitoring of Mr Doherty and, if that monitoring suggested it, restriction of his duties.  71As regards breaches in 2004, in my opinion it was well open to the primary judge to find that Ms Lette's email should have been provided to Dr Li.  Mr Doherty had already been diagnosed with PTSD, and even if he did not at that time satisfy the criteria for a present diagnosis of PTSD, at the very least his previous diagnosis of PTSD meant that he was susceptible to its onset and was likely to have been sensitised.  In those circumstances, it was open to the primary judge to find that a reasonable employer would have recognised that it was important for Dr Li to have the benefit of the opinion of a psychologist who had some familiarity with Mr Doherty and who was recommending that he see a psychiatrist.  72In addition, in my opinion it was open to the primary judge to find negligence in that Dr Li used the screening test DASS and not the PCL test, the former being a good test for depression and anxiety disorders and the latter being a good test for detection of PTSD - particularly in circumstances where Mr Doherty's work as a crime scene investigator was high risk for PTSD and Mr Doherty had, to Dr Li's knowledge, previously been diagnosed as suffering from that disorder.  73Although Professor McFarlane did not say that Dr Li should have referred Mr Doherty to a psychiatrist, and Dr Brown expressed a view that Dr Li's examination and advice were not negligent, in my opinion it was open to the primary judge to accept the view of another psychiatrist Dr Canaris, given in a report to Mr Doherty's solicitors, and to hold that Dr Li (particularly with the benefit of Ms Lette's email) would as a reasonable practitioner have referred Mr Doherty for assessment by a psychiatrist, or at least a psychologist; and also to hold that SNSW was in breach of duty in permitting Mr Doherty to return to work, without assessment by a psychiatrist or at least a psychologist, and without careful monitoring and/or other steps with a view to ensuring that his duties did not exacerbate his condition.  74Accordingly, grounds 1 - 3 fail.  There is a Notice of Contention in which Mr Doherty relies on the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (OHS Act) and the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 (OHS Reg):  it is not necessary to consider this here, although it could be relevant to contributory negligence.  Causation  75It was submitted by Mr Menzies that the question of causation should be considered in the context of the primary judge's finding that Mr Doherty's psychological injury began in 1994, that he had symptoms in 1996 and following years, that by 1998/1999 he was abusing alcohol, and that he had further symptoms in 2001 and 2002, before any proved negligence by SNSW.  None of these injuries was caused by SNSW's negligence.  Mr Menzies submitted that, even if there had been a follow up of the under-reporting finding of April 2001, the court should not have been satisfied that a psychologist would have detected that Mr Doherty needed to be removed from crime scene investigation or not exposed to traumatic scenes without psychological treatment, especially when it was clear that Mr Doherty would have withheld disclosure of symptoms and would have claimed he was ""travelling well"".  76Mr Menzies submitted that in any event, the psychometric test in 2002 revealed nothing untoward, suggesting that any problem had resolved; and the 2003 interviews with Ms Bloom did not suggest that a review in 2002 by a psychologist reporting to SNSW would have made any significant difference.  77Similarly for 2003, Mr Menzies submitted, interviews with Ms Bloom did not support the primary judge's finding that a psychologist reporting to SNSW would have uncovered Mr Doherty's traumatic memories, nightmares and sleep difficulties.  Even on the evidence of Professor McFarlane and Dr Brown, Mr Doherty was able to return to work full-time in May 2003, albeit that for a period he should have been withheld from crime scenes.  In fact, it was not until November 2003 that Mr Doherty was exposed to anything which, on his evidence, caused distress; and even then, this was not such that Mr Doherty felt the need to report it to his medical practitioners.  78As regards 2004, Mr Menzies submitted, the primary judge erred in concluding that a psychiatric examination of Mr Doherty would have precluded his return to work in November 2004.  79Further, Mr Menzies submitted, the findings of causation made by the primary judge were not open, in circumstances where the primary judge did not resolve a conflict in the evidence concerning chronicity and treatment between Professor McFarlane and Professor Tennant:  see grounds 6 and 7.  Even if the primary judge's views concerning chronicity and treatment were accepted, the cause of Mr Doherty's injuries was his deliberate continuing to expose himself to traumatic events, in circumstances where Mr Doherty well knew that he was ill, that his illness was caused by his exposure to traumatic events, and that continuing exposure would at least continue his illness.  80Finally, Mr Menzies submitted that even if ""but for"" causation were established, the contributory negligence found by the primary judge was such that the scope of SNSW's liability should not extend to the harm caused to Mr Doherty, within that expression as used in s 5D(1)(b) of the Civil Liability Act .  81In my opinion, it was open to the primary judge to find that, had the under-reporting observation of April 2001 been followed up, by a psychologist with qualifications apt to detect signs of PTSD, the problems then being experienced by Mr Doherty of feelings of extreme fear, helplessness and horror, flashbacks and nightmares, would have been disclosed by targeted questioning, even if Mr Doherty had attempted to withhold disclosure of these things; and this would have meant he would not be further exposed to traumatic scenes without having psychological treatment and being subject to monitoring.  82In my opinion also, it was open to the primary judge to find that but for the breaches in 2003, Mr Doherty would not have returned to crime scene work on 4 June 2003, and (subject to what I say below concerning the conflict between Professor McFarlane and Professor Tennant) that if he had been taken out of crime scene work in mid-2003 and provided appropriate treatment, he would still be working full-time.  Again, in my opinion it was open to find to the effect that targeted questioning of Mr Doherty would have disclosed his problems.  However, I do note that the primary judge did not explicitly find that Mr Doherty would never in fact have returned to crime scene work, or that PTSD would not in any event have developed at some other time or in some other way than it did; and this has some relevance to grounds 10 and 12.  83In my opinion, it was open to the primary judge to find that, but for breaches in 2004, Mr Doherty would not have been certified as fit for full operational duties in November 2004, that he would not then have been exposed to traumatic events in 2005, and that he would still then have had capacity for some employment within the police force.  However, it seems that the primary judge did not quantify the extent of this capacity, and this too has some possible relevance to grounds 10 and 12.  84In my opinion, it is not an answer to these findings that Mr Doherty's own contributory negligence contributed in a ""but for"" sense to his own injuries; nor in my opinion can it be said in terms of s 5D(1)(b) that Mr Doherty's own contribution was such that SNSW's liability should not extend to Mr Doherty's injuries.  The effect of Mr Doherty's contributory negligence is appropriately dealt with by apportionment.  85In my opinion, it was open to the primary judge to find that the negligence of SNSW was, in terms of s 5D(1)(a), a necessary condition for the occurrence of Mr Doherty's injuries, as they occurred after about April 2001, by which time the Lette and Mutton recommendations of May 1999 should have been put into effect, and the under-reporting comment should have been followed up.  86Accordingly, grounds 4, 9 and 11 fail.  Contested medical evidence  87Mr Menzies submitted that the primary judge erred in pars [249] - [251] of his judgment (set out at [52] above).  His written submissions continue:  37. Paragraphs 249 to 251 of his Honour's judgment reveal error. His Honour confused 2 concepts: entrenchment and treatment responder/non-responder. The former concept is concerned with the disorder becoming more difficult to treat because of repeated traumatic exposures, whilst the latter merely describes two broad classes of persons who have the disorder, dividing them between whether they are amenable to treatment or not.  38. The fact that the Respondent was a treatment responder says nothing about whether delay in treatment will affect outcome. Professor Tennant's point was that if one is a treatment responder then, although repeated traumatic exposures would result in chronicity, once treatment is instituted, the outcome would be the same regardless of when the treatment was instituted. Delay in treatment does not affect the ultimate outcome.  39. Professor McFarlane's view, on the other hand, was that repeated exposures would result in a chronic disorder which would be entrenched by repeated exposures.  40. Professor Tennant took no issue with the concept of chronicity, his departure from Professor McFarlane's view related to whether the degree of that chronicity affected later treatment. He said it did not.  41. The resolution of that dilemma (that is, whether repeated exposure resulted in entrenchment) was necessary to answer the question posed by his Honour, namely, did repeated exposures affect the ultimate outcome. His Honour declined to resolve that issue, but without resolution of that he proceeded to conclude that repeated exposures would affect the outcome adversely to the Respondent's health. That was simply wrong and was not open to him without the earlier resolution of that question.  88The disagreement between Professor McFarlane and Professor Tennant can be illustrated by the following material.  89In his evidence in chief, following the passage quoted by the primary judge at par [244] of his judgment (par [52] above), Professor McFarlane said this (1 Black 261P-W):  Perhaps if I can just explain one aspect of that. A critical component of post traumatic stress disorder is that people get a conditioned stress response to certain qualities or reminders or characteristics of crime scenes. And as with any form of learning, the more frequent that learning is reinforced, the stronger that link becomes and the more difficult it is to extinguish or unlearn that association. For example, it might be the smell of decaying bodies; it might be the sight of terribly mutilated bodies that will be associated with a fear response and that becomes increasingly entrenched. Normally people can suppress those responses, just as one does in medicine when dealing with patients. Normally our fear responses don't get evoked, but if they do get released they can progressively get strengthened and perpetuated and that is the risk for Mr Doherty when he returns to crime scene work, that this learned association is further strengthened and once it reaches a certain level, it is difficult to extinguish that learning.  90In cross-examination, Professor McFarlane said this (1 Black 336T-337D):  Q. Yes.  Let it be assumed he has been treated, he goes back to work, he then at some point becomes ill again, the proposition I am putting to you is that - and you have already disagreed with this - I am not putting this proposition again but proceeding from the proposition that further exposure did not cause his problem to be worsened although it may have caused it to recur, what I am suggesting to you is the fact that there was a further exposure and a delay in treatment as a consequence, had the effect - had a deleterious effect upon his symptoms at the time only until treatment reassumed?  A. I don't accept that, your Honour, because I believe that if, as we were discussing yesterday, the issues of the underlying mechanisms of this condition, it reinforced the association between his symptoms and the memories and the environment that triggered those symptoms.  I mean, it's a basic principle of learning, the longer you practice the piano the better you get at it.  You know, the longer you are exposed to this workplace, the more entrenched your symptoms become and the link between your symptoms and those memories is strengthened.  91Professor Tennant, on the other hand, clearly asserted (1)  that the duration of pre-treatment PTSD does not affect post-treatment clinical outcome (2 Blue 772M, 773T, 786Y, 787F and 787N, 3 Blue 1242X, 1 Black 416S, 417G-R).  Less clearly, he asserted (2)  that even when delay is coupled with exposure to further traumatic events, this does not affect post-clinical treatment outcome (2 Blue 789I-N, 1 Black 416Q-S).  92However, Professor Tennant also said:  (1) ""It is however accepted that if stressors continue through the treatment phase, or after, there may be an adverse effect"":  2 Blue 789O.  (2) ""Multiple acute traumas further increase the risk of PTSD onset or a failure for existing PTSD to resolve"":  3 Blue 1242T.  (3) ""if you have developed symptoms and you are re-exposed over time to more and more traumatic events, those initial symptoms won't recover.  They are likely to get worse and become chronic"":  1 Black 416O-P.  (4) ""chronic ongoing stressors ... is likely to perpetuate and make people more chronic"":  1 Black 418H.  (5) ""if you continue stressing them while treatment is going on, that's not going to work"":  1 Black 418M.  93It is not clear whether Professor Tennant is claiming that there are no degrees of seriousness or chronicity of PTSD; or that even though there are such degrees, they make no difference to post-treatment outcomes.  The former view would appear to contradict his references to symptoms getting worse and people becoming more chronic.  The latter view seems highly counter-intuitive.  94The primary judge at least by implication resolved the disagreement between Professor McFarlane and Professor Tennant concerning the second proposition apparently asserted by Professor Tennant.  His findings at pars [245] and [246] implicitly adopt Professor McFarlane's views.  Although in par [249] and [250], the primary judge seems to suggest he had not resolved the question, in par [251] the primary judge seems only to address Professor Tennant's first proposition, namely that delay in treatment does not affect outcome; and certainly any disagreement about that proposition was not necessary for the primary judge to resolve, because what was involved in this case was not only delay but also, and more importantly, exposure to further traumatic scenes.  95It could be that the primary judge's reasons here are less than fully satisfactory; but, having regard to the primary judge's implicit preference for Professor McFarlane on the crucial issue, and the counter-intuitive character of Professor Tennant's view on that crucial issue, in my opinion this is not a matter that could be considered as causing a miscarriage of justice that would justify a new trial.  Uncaused damages  96I note that although ground 10 is expressed in broad terms, in written submissions SNSW stated that it stands or falls on the correctness of grounds 6 and 7.  That position was not changed in oral submissions; and accordingly, although for reasons I will give that ground may have had some success, it need not be considered further.  97Ground 12 refers to the primary judge's rejection at par [287] of his judgment of the contention that damages should be discounted because of the possibility that Mr Doherty's condition would or may have occurred in any event, and to the primary judge's limitation of the discount for vicissitudes in relation to future economic loss to the conventional figure of 15 percent.  98Mr Menzies submitted that, in the light of Mr Doherty's underlying injury which was in existence since 1994, and the nature of which is that it waxes and wanes, the primary judge should have allowed 30 percent for vicissitudes rather than the conventional 15 percent.  99Mr Doherty SC, senior counsel for the respondent Mr Doherty, submitted that there was no evidence that would overcome the evidentiary onus on SNSW to lead evidence to disentangle causes of Mr Doherty's condition: Watts v Rake (1960) 108 CLR 158, Purkess v Crittenden (1965) 114 CLR 164.  The primary judge had found that, but for SNSW's breaches, he would have been able to keep working in the police force and been the same as the rest of us.  Mr Doherty SC submitted that the considerations addressed in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Limited (1990) 169 CLR 638 had no application.  100As noted in par [81] above, the finding of the primary judge as to the consequences of pre-2003 breaches was to the effect that Mr Doherty would not have been further exposed to traumatic scenes without having psychological treatment and monitoring; and as noted in par [82] above, the primary judge made no finding that Mr Doherty would never in fact have returned to crime scene work but for the 2003 breaches. Prime facie therefore, the primary judge did not by those findings absolutely exclude the possibility that, even if SNSW had not committed those breaches, there would have been further exposure that may have triggered PTSD.  101As noted in par [83], the finding of the primary judge as to the effect of the 2004 breaches did not quantify the extent of the capacity Mr Doherty would have had if those particular breaches had not occurred.  102Plainly, the effect of the primary judge's findings was that, on the balance of probabilities, PTSD as suffered by Mr Doherty and his consequent disabilities were caused by the negligence of SNSW; and although that to some extent involves a finding on the balance of probabilities of a hypothetical fact, namely that Mr Doherty would not have suffered PTSD substantially as he actually did, but for that negligence, those findings must be considered matters of certainty, once they have been made:  cf Malec at 642-643, Tabet v Gett [2010] HCA 12; (2010) 240 CLR 537 at [136] per Keifel J (Hayne and Bell JJ and Crennan J agreeing).  However, although the existence of damage must be established on the balance of probabilities and then treated as certain, these passages show that the assessment of the amount of that damage may have regard to probabilities of varying degrees.  103I accept that the primary judge's finding precludes consideration of probabilities that Mr Doherty may in any event have suffered entrenched PTSD at substantially the same time and in substantially the same way as he actually did.  However, in my opinion the findings of the primary judge do not preclude regard being had to probabilities, including probabilities of a low order, that Mr Doherty's long history of psychological damage beginning in 1994, coupled with his determination to keep working and to conceal his symptoms, may have had the result that, even if SNSW had not breached its duty, he may have come to suffer ongoing and disabling PTSD at some time and/or with some causal history substantially different from his actual onset of entrenched PTSD.  104I do not think this is a case where SNSW failed to discharge an evidentiary onus, as in Watts or Purkess .  I think the whole of the evidence in the case shows the development in Mr Doherty from 1994 onwards of a severe vulnerability to PTSD, independently of any breach by SNSW of its duties; and it also shows substantial difficulties and uncertainties in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of PTSD, particularly in the case of a person determined to keep on working and to conceal symptoms.  The ultimate onus is on Mr Doherty to prove the amount of his damages; and in my opinion there are uncertainties concerning what would have happened, even if SNSW had fulfilled its duties, which at the very least justify a significant increase in vicissitudes in the calculation of future economic loss.  105It may be that these considerations would also have justified some discounts of other elements of Mr Doherty's damages; but that was not sought by SNSW.  In my opinion it is appropriate to increase the discount for vicissitudes to 30 percent as sought by SNSW.  Contributory negligence  106On the cross-appeal, it was submitted for Mr Doherty that the primary judge erred in finding (par [269]) that Mr Doherty gave information to Dr Li that was intentionally untrue, in circumstances where it had not been put to Mr Doherty that what he told Dr Li was untrue, much less intentionally so.  107Other submissions for Mr Doherty were to the effect that he did give substantial information to Dr Harvey and to Ms Bloom, and that he could not have been expected to arrange for his own testing by a police psychologist; that any lack of information given to these and other people was due to inadvertence or lack of appreciation of his own condition; and that in any event, the information which he did give was sufficient to alert SNSW to the need to take appropriate action.  108It was also submitted that SNSW had statutory duties under the OHS Act and OHS Reg; and that SNSW should have taken into account the well known culture of police not to report and/or to under-report psychological problems.  109It was submitted that Mr Doherty did not contribute to many of the breaches by SNSW; and that he should not have been found guilty of contributory negligence.  110For SNSW, it was submitted that Mr Doherty, by his own conduct, created a risk of psychological injury which would have been avoided if he had been frank with those trying to assist him.  111In my opinion, the primary judge should not have made a finding that Mr Doherty gave information to Dr Li that was intentionally untrue, when this had not been put to him in cross-examination.  112As regards the OHS Act and OHS Reg, in my opinion this makes no relevant difference to assessment of contributory negligence.  OHS Reg 11 requires an employer to eliminate or control risks, the latter requirement being relevant here.  Reg 5 provides relevantly that an obligation to control a risk is an obligation to minimise the risk ""to the lowest level reasonably practicable"".  The finding of negligence in this case amounts to a finding that SNSW did not do this; but I do not think this different definition of the obligations of SNSW materially affects assessment of the degree of its responsibility for Mr Doherty's damages, either in terms of degree of fault or causal efficacy.  113Other matters raised by both sides were in my view adequately dealt with in the judgment of the primary judge, and no error is shown in the way he did so.  114As regards the finding that Mr Doherty gave information to Dr Li that was intentionally untrue, I am not satisfied that this played such a role in the primary judge's assessment of contribution as to vitiate his decision.  In any event, I consider the primary judge's assessment a reasonable one.  115I would reject ground 5 of the grounds of appeal, and I would dismiss Mr Doherty's cross-appeal.  Conclusion  116The figure of $599,449 arrived at for future economic loss and $74,055.35 arrived at for future superannuation benefits represent 85 percent of certain calculated figures; and in my judgment a reduction should be made so that these items represent 70 per cent of those figures.  This is achieved by multiplying them by the fraction 70/85, giving figures of $493,663.88 and $60,986.76 respectively.  117This has the effect of reducing the damages before reduction for contributory negligence by ($599,449 plus $74,055.35) minus ($493,663.88 plus $60,986.76), that is, by $118,853.71.  This gives reduced damages of $1,040,749.15; and reducing that by 35 percent for contributory negligence, one arrives at a figure for judgment of $676,486.91.  118This result gives some success on the appeal for the State of New South Wales.  However, on the main issues raised, SNSW failed; and the ground on which it succeeded was raised only in an amended notice of appeal notified shortly before the hearing.  119In my opinion, the appropriate order as to costs is that each party pay its own costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.  120Accordingly, the orders I propose are:  (1) Appeal allowed in part.  (2) Verdict and judgment for Mr Doherty for $676,486.91 substituted for the verdict and judgment below, to take effect from 20 May 2010.  (3) Appeal otherwise dismissed.  (4) Cross-appeal dismissed.  (5) Each party to pay its own costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, Mr Doherty to have a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 in respect of his own costs of the appeal.  121WHEALY JA: I agree with Hodgson JA.  122HANDLEY AJA: I agree with Hodgson JA.  **********

		05 August 2011",2011-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2757543,Firbank v R [2011] NSWCCA 171,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant Luke Firbank was convicted of various offences which he allegedly committed on 11 September 2008. The appellant raised six grounds of appeal. Ground 2 is concerned with an irregularity in the transcript provided to the jury during the trial and in my judgment must be upheld with the consequence that a new trial is required. 

2The appellant and Vincenzo Ritorto who I shall refer to as Vincenzo lived in the same neighbourhood and knew each other. Early in September 2008 Vincenzo bought $20 worth of cannabis from the appellant. Vincenzo agreed that he would pay the appellant once he had the money. 

3The $20 had not been repaid when on 11 September 2008 Vincenzo, who was at home in his dwelling, heard a loud sound at the door. It was the Crown case that when Vincenzo opened his front door he found the appellant standing there looking aggressive and tense. The appellant asked about the $20. Vincenzo told the appellant that he had the money and invited him in. When Vincenzo began to explain that he had tried to call the appellant about the money, the appellant immediately tried to punch him and Vincenzo fought back to defend himself. 

4Vincenzo is larger than the appellant and took effective control of the situation. The appellant then said that he was going home and told Vincenzo never to come to his place again. 

5The Crown alleged that some 2 minutes later Vincenzo heard the sound of breaking glass in his kitchen. He looked through the kitchen windows and saw the appellant standing outside. He had an implement in his hand with which he was smashing the kitchen windows. The appellant did not say anything and Vincenzo phoned the police. The appellant allegedly called out ""you're not calling the cops are you."" And then left. 

6Vincenzo contacted Triple 0 and complained about the appellant who requested that the police attend. 

7While waiting for the police Vincenzo started to clean up and collect the broken glass. As he was doing this he again saw the appellant outside his kitchen window holding a torch and with a knife in his hand. The appellant allegedly came through Vincenzo's front door, forced the door open and came into the unit. He allegedly swore at Vincenzo and said he was going to kill him. The appellant then moved towards Vincenzo. 

8It was the Crown case that Vincenzo grabbed the appellant, struggled with him and tried to overpower him. He managed to get him to the ground. Once Vincenzo had the appellant on the ground he punched him a number of times. As this was happening Vincenzo alleged that he saw that the knife that the appellant had was now broken and the handle and blade had split apart and were both on the floor. 

9The appellant then allegedly calmed down and they stopped struggling. The appellant then left and went home. 

10At that stage Vincenzo noticed that there was some blood on the carpet and that there was some blood on the door. He assumed that this was the blood from the appellant because he had hit him in the face and the appellant's nose had bled. Vincenzo was not immediately aware that he had himself been hurt. 

11Shortly afterwards the police arrived. Vincenzo realised something was wrong with his left side and when he checked he discovered that he had been stabbed above his hip in the area of his kidney. The police arranged for him to be taken to hospital by ambulance. 

12On 17 September 2008 the appellant was arrested and interviewed by the police. During the course of that interview the appellant admitted that he knew a man by the name of ""Vincent"" who lived at Vincenzo's address. He said he did not know him well. He said that he did not have any telephone contact with Vincent and that they only used to meet by seeing each other in the area. 

13The appellant denied ever selling cannabis to Vincent or Vincenzo. He admitted that he had been involved in a physical altercation with Vincenzo but said that the latter was the aggressor. He said he had stopped in to see Vincenzo and had been invited in for a cup of coffee. He said that Vincenzo had become very upset, worked up and very aggressive that day and had attacked him. 

14The appellant was asked whether he had damaged any of the windows at Vincenzo's home. He said he had not. He told the police that once he had left Vincenzo's unit he did not return again. He said that he had been hurt by Vincenzo in their initial altercation and that he never went back to his place, never smashed the windows and had never forced his way into Vincenzo's apartment. 

15On examination of the knife DNA consistent with being DNA from the appellant was identified. Some of the blood stains in the apartment also contained DNA which was consistent with the DNA of the appellant. The appellant denied using a knife at Vincenzo's premises on the relevant day. 

16The police examined the record from the appellant's mobile telephone. Three calls were identified as being made from the appellant's mobile telephone number to Vincenzo's home telephone number. 

17The first count on the indictment concerned an alleged supply of cannabis leaf by the appellant. Counts 2, 3 and 4 concern the altercation between the appellant and Vincenzo. Count 5 is an alternative to count 4. Count 6 is concerned with cannabis leaf which the police found at the appellant's premises. 

18The indictment was in the following terms: 

""1. Between 21 August 2008 and 11 September 2008 at Strathfield South in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely Cannabis leaf. 

Section 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985

Section 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
Law Part Code: 16972."" 

19The grounds of appeal are as follows: 

Ground 1: The trial miscarried and the verdict of guilty to count 4 is a nullity because count 4, as pleaded, discloses no offence known to law in that the purported circumstance of special aggravation was an essential element of the serious indictable offence of reckless wounding pleaded therein. 
Ground 2: The trial miscarried in that the jurors were provided, at their request, with a transcript of the evidence, including cross-examination of the applicant, which was incorrectly transcribed at page 335 point 9 and at page 372 point 39. 
Ground 3:(a) that leave be granted pursuant to Rule 4 to argue this ground. 
(b) The trial judge erred at law in not giving a direction of law that the jury have to be satisfied of four things before they could use lies told by the applicant as evidence of consciousness of guilt as suggested by the Crown Prosecutor in her final address and questions of the applicant in cross-examination. 
Ground 4:(a) That leave be granted pursuant to Rule 4 to argue this ground. 
(b) The trial judge erred in law in not giving a direction in accordance with Zoneff v The Queen in the form of a warning that the jury not follow a process of reasoning that just because the applicant is shown to have told a lie about something that that is evidence of guilt. 

Ground 5:(a) That leave be granted pursuant to Rule 4 to argue this ground. 
(b) The trial judge erred in law in interpreting in his summing up that the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the complainant did not have an axe to grind in seeking to make untrue allegations against the accused. 
Ground 6:(a) That leave be granted pursuant to Rule 4 to argue this ground. 
(b) The trial judge should have stayed count 3 and withdrawn the count from the jury once he directed the jury on an alternative Crown case on count 4. 

Ground 2 

20It is convenient to deal first with ground 2. 

21Two errors of particular significance occurred in the original transcript of the trial. Both errors occurred when the appellant was being cross-examined. The errors would not be of particular concern but for the fact that during the course of their deliberations the jury asked for a copy of the appellant's transcript. This request was made after the jury had indicated to the trial judge that although they were agreed on some counts (probably counts 1 and 6) they were divided in relation to the other counts. The jury were provided with a copy of the transcript some time after 2.21 pm on the final day of the trial. They returned to court at 3.36 pm that day and returned a verdict of guilty to all counts. Accordingly it is most likely that the jury, or at least some of its members, were assisted by an examination of the transcript. 

22The first error in the transcript concerns a question asked by the prosecutor when he was questioning the appellant about the allegation that he had returned to Vincenzo's premises and used a golf club to smash the windows. He was asked: 

""Q: You were very aggressive when you first got there?"" 

23The answer in the transcript is recorded as: 

""That is correct."" 

24This was an error. The audiotape indicates that the answer which the appellant gave was: 

""That's incorrect."" 

25The second error occurred when the appellant was being asked about his interview by the police and lies he may have told. He was asked: 

""Q: I suggest you lied because you were the man that was attacking Vincent with the knife, not the other way around? 

26The answer incorrectly recorded is: 

""That's correct."" 

27It should have been recorded as: 

""That's incorrect."" 

28Both of these answers were given in response to questions which had considerable significance in the trial. Evidence from the appellant that he had been aggressive when he first returned to Vincenzo's premises was damaging to his defence. Furthermore, evidence in which he accepted that he was the attacker with the knife was of critical significance. 

29The Crown submitted that the errors were unlikely to have influenced the jury in a manner which was unfair to the appellant. It was submitted that a careful reading of the whole of the transcript would have made plain to the jury that the errors did not accurately reflect the appellant's response to the Crown's case. Furthermore, it was submitted that if the errors had been significant it could be expected that the Crown would have attempted to utilise the transcript in the course of submissions. 

30I do not accept the Crown's submissions. It is regrettable that a transcript containing errors of this level of significance found its way to the jury. Although a reader of the transcript may have been alerted to the possibility that the answers which had been given were erroneous the jury did not ask for any clarification of the situation. Accordingly, I am satisfied that it must be assumed that the jury accepted the evidence as having been faithfully recorded. That evidence contained admissions which were potentially fatal to the appellant's case and I am accordingly satisfied that this Court should conclude that a serious injustice has occurred. Whatever be the strength of the Crown case the appellant was entitled to a fair trial. Once the jury's request was complied with, but an erroneous transcript provided, any opportunity which the appellant may have had of an acquittal was entirely lost. 

Ground 1: 

31The appellant submitted that because wounding was an essential fact to be proved in relation to the pleaded serious indictable offence (count 4) it could not also be relied upon as a circumstances of special aggravation. The pleaded count identified wounding as the circumstance of special aggravation. 

32In support of this argument the appellant relied upon the judgment of Simpson J in R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285. In that case, when sentencing an offender the primary judge had regard, as an aggravating factor, to the actual use of violence. The serious indictable offence had been pleaded as assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On appeal the Crown argued that the actual use of violence could be taken into account under s 105A of the Crimes Act where violence is identified as a circumstance of aggravation. Simpson J with whom Johnson and Rothman JJ agreed rejected the argument. 

33The Crown responded to the appellant's submission by referring to the decision of this Court in R v O'Donoghue [2005] NSWCCA 62;151 A Crim R 597. In that case the accused was charged with breaking and entering a dwelling and committing a serious indictable offence being assault occasioning actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation being the use of corporal violence. 

34The relevant section of the Crimes Act reads as follows: 

""112 Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence 
(1) A person who: 
(a) breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or 
(b) being in any dwelling-house or other building commits any serious indictable offence therein and breaks out of the dwelling-house or other building, is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 

(2) Aggravated offence 
A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 

(3) Specially aggravated offence 
A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (2) in circumstances of special aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years. 

"" Serious indictable offence"" means an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more.(S 4 Crimes Act)."" 

35Under s 112(1) the elements the Crown has to prove are: (1) that the accused broke into a (dwelling): and (2) committed a serious indictable offence therein. 

36In the indictment it is necessary to identify the serious indictable offence the Crown relies on. 

37Section 112(2) provides for a more serious offence where a person commits an offence contrary to s 112(1) in circumstances of aggravation. 

38Pursuant to s 105A(1), ""circumstances of aggravation"" means circumstances involving any one or more of the following: 

(a) the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument 
(b) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons 
(c) the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person 
(d) the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on any person 
(e) the alleged offender deprives a person of his or her liberty, and/or 
(f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed. 

39Section 112(3) provides for an offence of greater seriousness still where a person commits an offence contrary to s 112(1) in circumstances of special aggravation. 

40Pursuant to s 105A(1), ""circumstances of special aggravation"" means circumstances involving either or both of the following: 

(a) the alleged offender wounds or maliciously inflicts grievous bodily harm on any person; 
(b) the alleged offender is armed with a dangerous weapon. 

41Under s 105A (2) the matters referred to in: 

(a) paragraph (c), (d) or (e) of the definition of ""circumstances of aggravation""; or 
(b) paragraph (a) of the definition of ""circumstances of special aggravation"", can occur immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after any of the elements of the offence concerned occurred. 

42In O'Donoghue the appellant was charged with an offence contrary to s 112(2). The charge read as follows: 

""On (date) at (place) he did break and enter a dwelling house at (address) and commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely, did assault (victim), occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that corporal violence was used on (the victim)."" 

43The facts supporting this charge were that after the appellant had broken and entered the premises he picked up a scooter and threw it at a Mrs Grey. It missed her but hit the wall and the handlebars broke off. The victim was asleep in an adjoining room at the time. The commotion woke him and he came into the room where the appellant and Mrs Grey were. When the appellant saw (the victim) he picked up the handlebars and ran at him. The victim tried to fend off the appellant and get away from him, but the appellant pursued him through the house and hit him with the handlebars, bruising his forehead and his left wrist and cutting his hand. 

44On appeal it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the evidence did not support the conviction on the first count because the Crown relied on the same act, namely the striking with the handlebars, in order to prove the two elements of the charge, the commission of the serious indictable offence and the use of corporal punishment. It was submitted that because the serious indictable offence involved no more than the occasioning of actual bodily harm, the result was that the appellant had been punished twice for one act. 

45In his judgment, Barr J with whom Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreed, made reference to both Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 and said the following: 

""In my opinion, the appellant's act of attacking Mr Tenkate with the scooter handlebars and injuring him was sufficient to constitute both a serious indictable offence, namely an assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the circumstance of aggravation, namely the use by the appellant of corporal violence on a person. [22] 

46His Honour said in relation to Pearce: 

""...it is important to note that what the justices in Pearce v The Queen did not say was that single act cannot be a component of more than one offence or that a single act may constitute more than one component of a single offence."" [13] 

47In relation to De Simoni his Honour said: 

""There is, in my opinion, no significant difference between the facts of De Simoni and those of the present case. In each case, a single act was held sufficient at once to constitute an element of the simple offence and the circumstance which aggravated it exposing the offender to the risk of a higher sentence"". [20] 

48De Simoni is authority for the proposition that when sentencing an offender a court is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which may aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence. An offence that carries a higher maximum penalty than the offence for which the offender is being sentenced will be a more serious offence for the purposes of this principle. 

49In O'Donoghue, Barr J further said at [23]-[25]: 

""There is another argument, which I think is really a manifestation of the first, that because it has a component which, however described, amounts to corporal violence, the simple offence created by subs (1) cannot be aggravated by the addition of the element of corporal violence created by subs (2). The appellant was punished once for corporal violence under subs (1) and again for corporal violence under subs (2). 

I think that the submission mistakes the nature of the relevant element in subs (1), which is not assaulting or doing bodily harm or corporal violence. All subs (1) requires is proof of an act which constitutes a serious indictable offence. The reference in the charge to the occasioning of actual bodily harm stated a particular of the element of the offence, not the element itself. 

The analogy of an assault with an act of indecency is again instructive. All that that offence requires is an assault which has a particular quality, namely that of being an indecent act. All that the aggravated offence of which the appellant was convicted requires is corporal violence which has a particular quality, namely that of constituting a serious indictable offence."" 

50The respondent submitted that this Court was required to follow O'Donoghue which was in essence on ""all fours"" with the present case. 

51In the present case, the serious indictable offence was particularised as ""reckless wounding"". The special circumstance of aggravation under s 105A(1) was ""wounding."" Accordingly it was submitted that the reference to reckless wounding referred to a particular of an element of the offence, namely a serious indictable offence being an offence contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act, not the element itself. It followed that the wounding of the victim was a circumstance of special aggravation under s 105A(1) of the Crimes Act and accordingly the indictment as framed was not bad in law. 

52Although it was suggested by the appellant that the decision in O'Donoghue is not correct, leave was not sought to argue that it should be overruled. When a submission is made that a previous decision of this Court is wrong it would be usual for a bench comprising five members of the court to be convened. No application for a bench of five was made. 

53Price was concerned with the sentence for the relevant offence and whether the court could have regard to an aggravating factor under s 21A being the use of violence (s 21A(2)(b)). Although Simpson J passed some comment which could be understood to be critical of the form of the indictment (see Simpson J at [31]) the Court was not required to consider whether the indictment was valid. However, O'Donoghue was concerned with an appeal against conviction, and as it is directly on point I would not depart from it. The issue may be raised in another case but has not been appropriately raised for consideration in the present matter. 

54Accordingly ground 1 of the appeal must be rejected. 

Grounds 3 and 4 

55I have previously referred to that portion of the cross-examination of the appellant when the Crown Prosecutor put to him that he had lied to the police when he was interviewed because ""he was the man attacking (Vincent) with the knife, not the other way around"" and ""... you lied at that stage because of fear of your own guilt."" The appellant admitted that he lied but said that he did this to protect Vincenzo. 

56In her closing address the Crown Prosecutor said to the jury: ""He couldn't tell you the truth in my submission because he lied in the video interview because he is guilty."" 

57In the course of his submission to the jury defence counsel also referred to the lies and submitted to the jury that they could: 

"" consider his evidence to be plausible that he was protecting himself at that stage regarding the windows and protecting Ritorto. He was brought up not to dob and so on. He was confused, it is submitted and that was prior to the police interview. He was misguided at the time. He did not fully understand his rights but now he does and he has (sic) given the freedom and the chance to say what actually happened. 

...it is submitted to you quite accurately if you believe that the accused's account might possibly be true, then you would necessarily find the accused not guilty of counts one to five because that would really mean that you have a reasonable doubt about his guilt."" 

58During the course of the summing-up the trial judge referred to the lies which the appellant had acknowledged when giving his evidence. His Honour referred to the submissions of both the prosecution and defence counsel but did not give either an Edwards ( Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193) or a Zoneff (Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234) direction. 

59After the trial judge had finished summing-up the jury was sent out following which the Crown Prosecutor said to his Honour: 

""I was just questioning my mind in relation to whether the lie direction was sufficient but I think it was clear that it's used in relation to the accused's credibility. I think that was clear."" 

60Defence counsel responded: 

""I wouldn't be seeking any further directions."" 

61In these circumstances leave pursuant to rule 4 is required in relation to both grounds 3 and 4 of the appeal. I would not grant that leave. 

62It is apparent from the context in which the Crown Prosecutor told the jury that the appellant lied to the police because he was guilty that this remark was an incidental observation forming part of a more comprehensive attack on the appellant's credibility. Although reference was made to the guilt of the appellant that remark played only a minor role in the overall submission. 

63The credibility of the appellant was very much at issue in the trial. The fact that he admitted to having lied raised serious difficulties for the defence and it is not surprising that defence counsel did not want to return to that subject after the trial judge had finished summing-up. If defence counsel had opened up the prospect of either an Edwards or Zoneff direction it would have necessitated the trial judge returning to the question of lies, reminding the jury of the appellant's propensity to lie either in his own interests or as he said to protect others. The latter statement was inherently improbable and a repetition of it would almost certainly have reinforced an adverse impression of the appellant in the mind of the jury. To my mind this was a sensible tactical reason why counsel did not seek a further direction. See R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4. 

64In these circumstances it is unnecessary to determine whether the lie which was told required an Edwards or Zoneff direction. However, it is pertinent to observe that the appellant admitted the lie and gave his reason for telling the lie. The jury did not have to be reminded that there may have been an innocent but unknown explanation for the lie, the explanation was proffered by the appellant. The available and to my mind inevitable conclusion was that if the jury did not accept the explanation for the lie the only other reason for the lie was to avoid an admission which would support his guilt. However, for the reasons I have indicated it is unnecessary to resolve that issue in this case. 

Ground 5 

65The appellant submitted that the effect of the prosecutor's submission was to reverse the onus of proof. It was submitted that when dealing with the issue the trial judge compounded the problem. In the course of her address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor said: 

""...if you are listening to somebody giving evidence or any person in your life one of the factors you may look at is that a person who appears to have an axe to grind, is that a person who seems to have some sort of nastiness in relation to the person. Well when you listen to Vince Ritorto's evidence he was very clear that the accused is a good person who had helped him in the past, a person who'd gotten a fridge for him and gotten a television for him He was a person that he'd told about his problems and about his background. A person that he had trusted to discuss his family with. He knew the accused's mother also suffered from a mental illness because the two of them had been in hospital together. And over the time period he had actually discussed his life and his back ground with the accused..[P 404.29] 

66In the summing up the trial judge dealt with this submission in the following terms: 

""The crown submitted to you, or asked the rhetorical question, ""Does the accused have an axe to grind?"" and submitted that the answer to that is ""No"" that he himself said that it was out of character for the accused , the accused was a good person, he said who had helped him in the past, and so on. So he does not have an axe to grind in seeking to make untrue allegations against accused."" 

67It is apparent that the reference to the accused in the second line should have read Vincenzo. 

68When dealing with the question of onus the trial judge referred to the fact that the Crown carried the onus and said: 

""Now the accused I have told you already but I remind you is not obliged, except in the limited case of count 6 in the area that I explained to you, to disprove anything or prove anything or to raise a reasonable doubt about anything. 

The accused's evidence when he chose to give evidence, he did not have to, becomes part of the whole body of evidence to be assessed by you in the same way as other witnesses. 

If you happen to disbelieve the accused on any important matter or in its entirety, I am not suggesting that you would, all of these things are a matter for you to decide, but consistently with the onus being on the Crown if you disbelieve the accused's evidence in important respects that does not automatically mean that you find the accused guilty. You would still need to examine Ritorto's evidence carefully and decide whether on his evidence you are satisfied to convict the accused beyond reasonable doubt. 

So it is not a case of which witness you prefer, whether you prefer Ritorto over the accused or the other way around for that matter, you need to examine each or all of the evidence in its context in the case that you need to analyse each witness."" 

69These directions were given shortly before his Honour referred to an ""axe to grind."" Although his Honour referred to the accused at the earlier point in his summing up I am satisfied that it would have been plain to the jury that his Honour was referring to the Vincenzo. The jury had been addressed in these terms by the prosecution and the remainder of his Honour's remarks confirm that the ""he"" that he was referring to in the last sentence was Vincenzo. 

70In these circumstances a direction that an accused bears no onus to prove a motive to lie was not required. It would have been plain to the jury that there was no onus on the accused to prove anything except to the limited extent required in relation to count 6. 

71I would refuse leave to argue ground 5. 

Ground 6 

72The final ground of appeal raises for consideration counts 3 and 4. 

73Count 3 reads as follows: ""that he on or about 11 September 2008 at (place) was armed with a knife with intent to commit an indictable offence namely intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical injury"". This was contrary to s 114(1). The elements of this offence are: 

(1) the accused was armed with a weapon or instrument; 
(2) the accused intended to commit an indictable offence. 

74Count 4 reads: ""that he on or about 11 September 2008 at (place) did break and enter a dwelling house (of the victim) knowing that there was a person in the said dwelling house and did commit a serious indictable offence therein namely reckless wounding in the circumstances of special aggravation namely that at the time of the break and enter did wound (the victim). This was contrary to s 112 (3). The elements of this offence are: 

(1) the accused broke and entered a dwelling house; and 
(2) committed a serious indictable offence. 
(3) in circumstances of special aggravation. 

75The appellant submitted that count 3 should have been stayed as it arises out of ""more than substantially the same conduct"" as that alleged in count 4. I do not accept the submission. 

76The elements of count 3 involve proof of possession of the knife with the intention of intimidating the victim, by causing him to fear physical injury. Although this occurred in the circumstances of the appellant entering the victim's home, such entry was not an element of the offence, as it was an element of the s 112(3) offence. The possession of the knife was an element of count 3, but it was just a circumstance of count 4. 

77The Crown's submissions contained a useful summary of the sequence of his Honour's directions in relation to these counts. The trial judge in summing up to the jury said in relation to count 3: 

""...you need to consider, first element is that he was armed...with a knife.. ..and when he was armed with a knife he had the intent; that is a mental intent...to commit an indictable offence namely intimidation with intent to cause physical violence."" 

78In relation to count 4 the trial judge said: 

""...Luke Firbank did break and enter a dwelling house. There are two elements there; did break-perhaps three- did break and enter a dwelling house (address). 

The next element is that he did that knowing that there was a person in the dwelling house. The next element of this is that he did commit a serious indictable offence therein, that is in the dwelling house, that is specified as reckless wounding....in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the break and enter he did wound Vincenzo Ritorto."" 

79The trial judge returned to count 3 saying: 

""...the crown case is that when the accused came in on the occasion referred to, he had a knife held in his hand, you have heard the description as to how that was, the accused [sic] gave evidence of the accused holding the knife by the handle and a torch in the other hand. Now if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the accused entered the house holding a knife in that fashion, in the context of what had gone before, and so on, and pushing the door open, et cetera, you might readily conclude, although it is a matter for you, that the accused was armed with a knife."" 

[sic] the transcript records the judge as saying ""the accused"" when clearly the reference was to the victim. 

80His Honour then gave directions on what ""can be described in law as being armed with something"" and said: 

""So you would need to look at that element,... whether you are satisfied that beyond reasonable doubt the accused was armed with the knife ...you would need to further go on to decide whether that was with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical violence."" 

81His Honour then gave directions on ""intent"" followed by directions on ""intimidation"" and said: 

""...the crown relies on Ritorto's evidence necessarily in relation to this as well, and if you were satisfied that he accurately described and correctly described this series of events, then it would be open to you to convict the accused of that count, provided that you were satisfied, looking at what the accused said and what he did, that he had that necessary intent to intimidate"". 

82His Honour then moved on to count 4 and gave directions of law in relation to ""break and enter"" and on ""dwelling house"" and then on the issue of whether the appellant knew the victim was in the dwelling. The trial judge then turned to the issue of the appellant having committed a serious indictable offence, namely reckless wounding and gave directions on recklessness, and then said: 

""... Ritorto described what he said had happened and in the course of this he gave evidence that the accused approached him holding the knife and Ritorto ran at the accused and a scuffle ensued in the course of which Ritorto was stabbed and wounded...So the act that the accused is alleged to have done in this context is that of holding the knife in the aggressive way that was described and continuing to hold it once Ritorto ran at him. 

...if you are satisfied of these things beyond reasonable doubt, those elements, you would need to go on to consider whether the reckless wounding was committed in circumstances of special aggravation, namely that at the time of break and enter did wound Vincenzo Ritorto...if you are satisfied that there was the reckless wounding then the finding of the special aggravation would seem to follow as a matter of commonsense...."" 

83There is no immutable bar to the Crown prosecuting an accused person for a number of offences that arise out of the same sequence of events. However, if this occurs and a conviction follows the sentencing judge must be careful to avoid punishing the accused person twice for the same offending behaviour. This will normally be reflected in the adjustments made for accumulation and concurrency in the respective sentences. As it happens in the present case the trial judge imposed a sentence of 3 months for count 3 to be served concurrently with the sentence for count 4. 

84In the circumstances I am not persuaded that there was an error because the trial judge did not stay count 3 or withdraw it from the jury. No request was made by defence counsel for the trial judge to take this course and I would refuse leave to argue this ground. 

The proviso 

85The respondent submitted that this appeal should be dismissed having regard to the proviso (s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act ). As I have explained the problems occasioned by the jury having an incorrect transcript were of considerable significance in the events which happened and in my opinion resulted in a trial which was unfair to the appellant. Irrespective of the strength of the Crown case I am satisfied that in all of the circumstances ground 2 of the appeal should be upheld the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered. 

86It would seem likely that the problem identified under ground 2 did not infect the jury's verdict in relation to counts 1 and 6 relating to the supply of cannabis leaf. However well founded that expectation may be the attitude which the jury took to the appellant and his credibility may have been adversely affected by consideration of the erroneous transcript. I would uphold the appeal in relation to each of the counts on the indictment. 

Orders 

1. Appeal upheld. 
2. The convictions of the appellant in the District Court are quashed. 
3. A new trial is ordered. 

87HIDDEN J: As to grounds 1 and 6, one might question whether counts 3, 4 and 5 were all necessary to reflect the criminality alleged. Nevertheless, I agree with McClellan CJ at CL that those two grounds are not made out. I agree with his Honour's determination of the other grounds and with the orders proposed. 

88JOHNSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and his Honour's reasons for those orders. 

89I wish to make a brief additional comment concerning Ground 1. McClellan CJ at CL refers to submissions made by the parties concerning the decisions of this Court in R v O'Donoghue [2005] NSWCCA 62; 151 A Crim R 597 and R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285. As a member of the Court in R v Price , I note that the earlier decision in R v O'Donoghue was not drawn to the Court's attention. I endorse expressly the conclusion reached at [53] by the Chief Judge at Common Law concerning the approach to these two decisions in the determination of this appeal.

		06 February 2013",2011-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757545,R v Vos [2011] NSWCCA 172,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The respondent, a police officer, was charged by indictment with eleven counts. The first three counts allege that he fabricated false evidence. These proceedings are not concerned with those counts.

2Counts 4 to 11 of the indictment allege a breach of s 107 of the Police Integrity Commission Act 1996 (""the Act""). Section 107 provides that a person who ""at a hearing before the Commission, gives evidence that is, to the knowledge of the person, false or misleading in a material particular is guilty of an indictable offence"" (s 107(1)).

3The respondent successfully moved in the District Court for a permanent stay with respect to counts 4 to 11. The primary judge held that because the person granted leave to appear at the relevant hearing was not a qualified legal practitioner the proceedings before the Police Integrity Commission where the respondent gave evidence were a nullity, with the consequence that the evidence given in those proceedings could not be the foundation for a charge of perjury. Her Honour described the problem as a fundamental flaw in the proceedings which was unable to be cured.

4The Director appeals from that decision to this Court pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The granting of a permanent stay constitutes an interlocutory judgment or order for the purpose of s 5F(2) (R v King (2003) 59 NSWLR 472 at [22]).

5The Act established the Police Integrity Commission as a body to ""detect, investigate and prevent police corruption and other serious police misconduct"" (s 3(a)). 

6The Commission is constituted by a Commissioner appointed pursuant to s 7 of the Act. Section 8 provides for the appointment of Assistant Commissioners. Section 10 provides for the staff of the Commission. Assistant Commissioners are included amongst the staff of the Commission (s 8).

7Section 12 of the Act provides for the appointment of counsel to assist the Commission. That section is in the following terms:

""The Commissioner may appoint an Australian legal practitioner to assist the Commission as counsel, either generally or in relation to a particular matter or matters.""

8Part 3 of the Act provides for the functions of the Commission. The principal functions are provided in s 13(1) which is in the following terms:

""13 Principal functions

(1) The principal functions of the Commission are as follows: 

(a) to prevent police misconduct,
(b) to detect or investigate, or manage or oversee other agencies in the detection or investigation of, police misconduct,
(c) (Repealed)
(d) to receive and assess all matters not completed by the Police Royal Commission, to treat any investigations or assessments of the Police Royal Commission as its own, to initiate or continue the investigation of any such matters where appropriate, and otherwise to deal with those matters under this Act, and to deal with records of the Police Royal Commission as provided by this Act.""

9Section 15 provides for the functions of the Commission in assembling evidence that may be admissible in the prosecution of a person for a criminal offence. When providing evidence which it has assembled to the relevant body the Commission may make observations and recommendations as to what action the Commission considers should be taken in relation to the evidence (s 15(2)). The Commission is also empowered to furnish information which it incidentally obtains to a relevant authority, or the Minister for the authority, with recommendations as to any action which the Authority should take (s 15(4)).

10Section 16 provides that the Commission may make assessments and form opinions on the basis of its investigations as to whether police misconduct or other misconduct or corrupt conduct of an administrative officer has or may have occurred (s 16(1)(a)). The Commission may make recommendations as to whether consideration should be given to the prosecution or the taking of disciplinary action against any person (s 16(1)(b)).

11Section 16(2) provides that the Commission may not make a finding or form an opinion that a person is guilty of a criminal or disciplinary offence or make a recommendation that a particular person should be prosecuted for a criminal or disciplinary offence.

12In the carrying out of its functions the Commission may establish task forces (s 17) and may cooperate with other agencies (s 18). The Commission is not bound by the rules or practice of evidence and can inform itself of any matter in such manner as it considers appropriate (s 20(1)). The Commission is also required to exercise its functions ""with as little formality and technicality as is possible"" and its hearings ""are to be conducted with as little emphasis on an adversarial approach as is possible"" (s 20(2)).

13Division 2 of Part 3 of the Act provides the Commission's powers in relation to investigations. Section 23 provides that the Commission may conduct an investigation and s 24 provides for a preliminary investigation. Various powers are provided for the Commission to obtain information and documents (Part 3 Div 3).

14Division 4 of Part 3 is concerned with hearings which may be conducted by the Commission. A hearing may be held for the purposes of an investigation (s 32(1)) and must be conducted by the Commissioner or by an Assistant Commissioner (s 32(2)). Section 33(1) provides that a hearing may be held in public or in private. Provision is made for the Commission to hear closing submissions in private although the hearing itself may be in public (s 33(2)). Section 33(2) contemplates that submissions may be made by a person appearing before the Commission, by an Australian legal practitioner representing such a person as well as by ""an Australian legal practitioner assisting the Commission as counsel.""

15A person interested in the subject matter of the hearing may appear (s 34) and may be represented by an Australian legal practitioner (s 35). 

16Section 37 provides for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Section 37(2) concerns the role of a legal practitioner appointed to assist the Commission. Section 37 is in the following terms:

""37 Examination and cross-examination of witnesses
(cf ICAC Act s 34)

(1) A person authorised or required to appear at a hearing, or a person's Australian legal practitioner authorised to appear at a hearing, may, with the leave of the Commission, examine or cross-examine any witness on any matter that the Commission considers relevant.

(2) An Australian legal practitioner appointed by the Commission to assist it may examine or cross-examine any witness on any matter that the Commission considers relevant.

(3) Any witness examined or cross-examined under this section has the same protection and is subject to the same liabilities as if examined by the Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner.""

17Section 38(1) provides power in the Commission to summon a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing. Section 38(3) provides:

""(3) The Commission may, at a hearing, take evidence on oath or affirmation and for that purpose: 

(a) the person presiding at the hearing may require a person appearing at the hearing to give evidence either to take an oath or make an affirmation in a form approved by the person presiding, and
(b) the person presiding, or a person authorised for the purpose by the person presiding, may administer an oath or affirmation to a person so appearing at the hearing.""

18Section 38(4) provides that a person who has been summonsed must attend until excused from further attendance.

19Section 39 provides powers in aid of the Commission's function in requiring witnesses to attend.

20Section 40 of the Act provides that a person who has been summonsed to attend at a hearing is not entitled to refuse to be sworn or to make an affirmation. Such a person is not entitled to refuse to answer any question put to them by the Commissioner or other person presiding at a hearing. Section 40 is in the following terms:

""40 Privilege as regards answers, documents etc

(cf ICAC Act s 37)

(1) A witness summoned to attend or appearing before the Commission at a hearing is not entitled to refuse: 
(a) to be sworn or to make an affirmation, or
(b) to answer any question relevant to an investigation put to the witness by the Commissioner or other person presiding at a hearing, or
(c) to produce any document or other thing in the witness's custody or control that the witness is required by the summons or by the person presiding to produce.

(2) A witness summoned to attend or appearing before the Commission at a hearing is not excused from answering any question or producing any document or other thing on the ground that the answer or production may incriminate or tend to incriminate the witness, or on any other ground of privilege, or on the ground of a duty of secrecy or other restriction on disclosure, or on any other ground.

(3) An answer made, or document or other thing produced, by a witness at a hearing before the Commission is not (except as otherwise provided in this section) admissible in evidence against the person in any civil or criminal proceedings, but may be used in deciding whether to make an order under section 173 or 181D of the Police Act 1990 and is admissible in any proceedings under Division 1A or 1C of Part 9 of that Act, an order under section 183A of that Act or any proceedings for the purposes of Division 2A of Part 9 of that Act with respect to an order under section 183A of that Act and in any disciplinary proceedings (including for the purposes of taking disciplinary action under Part 2.7 of the Public Sector Employment and Management Act 2002).

(4) Nothing in this section makes inadmissible: 
(a) any answer, document or other thing in proceedings for an offence against this Act or in proceedings for contempt under this Act, or
(b) any answer, document or other thing in any civil or criminal proceedings if the witness does not object to giving the answer or producing the document or other thing irrespective of the provisions of subsection (2), or
(c) any document in any civil proceedings for or in respect of any right or liability conferred or imposed by the document or other thing.

(5) Where: 
(a) an Australian legal practitioner or other person is required to answer a question or produce a document or other thing at a hearing before the Commission, and
(b) the answer to the question would disclose, or the document or other thing contains, a privileged communication passing between an Australian legal practitioner (in his or her capacity as an Australian legal practitioner) and a person for the purpose of providing or receiving legal professional services in relation to the appearance, or reasonably anticipated appearance, of a person at a hearing before the Commission,

the Australian legal practitioner or other person is entitled to refuse to comply with the requirement, unless the privilege is waived by a person having authority to do so.""

21Section 107 makes it an offence to give evidence before the Commission that is to the knowledge of the person false or misleading. 

22The respondent has been prosecuted for a breach of s 107 when giving evidence to a hearing conducted by Commissioner Pritchard. The factual circumstances from which the investigation before the Commission arose are not presently relevant. However, as a result of a complaint the Commission held a hearing. The respondent gave evidence under objection on 9 December 2008 and 17 December 2008. 

23On both of the days on which the respondent gave evidence a senior investigator with the Commission, Mr Errol Ryan was given leave by Commissioner Pritchard to appear and to examine the respondent. Mr Ryan was not an Australian legal practitioner and accordingly could not be appointed as counsel assisting pursuant to s 12 of the Act. Furthermore, he could not be authorised under s 37(2) to examine or cross-examine a witness.

24The respondent does not challenge the appointment of Commissioner Pritchard and accepts that, apart from the leave granted to Mr Ryan, the hearings were validly constituted. The respondent submitted below and repeated the submission in this Court that as a consequence of the fact that Mr Ryan was not authorised by the Act to ask questions at a hearing, any hearing in which he participated was a nullity. Accordingly so it was argued, any prosecution based upon evidence given by the respondent at a hearing in which Mr Ryan participated could not be tendered in evidence against him. 

25The respondent submitted that the mere granting of leave to Mr Ryan to appear had the effect of rendering the hearing a nullity even if Mr Ryan had not asked any questions. It was further submitted that because the hearing was a nullity any question asked by the Commissioner or counsel for the respondent and any response made by the respondent were not admissible in evidence against him.

26The trial judge was persuaded by the respondent's submission. The argument below was framed in terms of jurisdictional error. The trial judge accepted a submission that the statutory provisions concerning the appointment of counsel assisting were intended to ensure that persons would be examined or cross-examined only by persons with legal qualifications. The identified purpose was to ensure that ""counsel are accountable to the Commission and must abide by legal professional rules and obligations."" Reference was made to Craig v The State of South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 and R v Ashby (2010) VSC 14; 25 VR 107. Her Honour accepted that from those cases the following three matters of significance emerge in relation to the Commission:

1. First, the powers being exercised, that of questioning a person in relation to a Commission hearing, is a significant duty.

2. The requirement of having questions conducted by a properly qualified person with attendant duties and obligations is of high public importance.

3. In this case, even if witnesses object to answering questions they are compelled to do so by statute. This constitutes extensive powers.

27The trial judge provided the following analysis:

""In Cassel's case the issue was whether the District Court judge had erred in holding that the evidence was sufficient to prove that there had been a hearing validly conducted under the ICAC Act. The majority found that an administrative arrangement could, if necessary, be cured by the de facto officer rule. In this case the de facto officer rule does not apply. In light of the PIC Act's very clear and specific provisions the appointment of a person other than a legal practitioner to appear to assist PIC and to examine witnesses amounts to significantly more than an administrative arrangement. In considering whether the breach of a condition is to be considered a breach that nullifies the exercise of statutory power, this Court also has regard to the following issues: first where there can be a discerned legislative purpose. In this case the purpose of requiring an Australian legal practitioner must only be to require that counsel assisting be bound by the rules of conduct applicable to legal practitioners. If it were intended that Parliament intended that persons who were experienced in a particular prosecution or investigation (sic) they could have made that clear as they did in both the Local Courts Act and the Criminal Procedure Act. Secondly, the purpose of the PIC Act, the objects of the Act, to which I have already referred (s 3). Notwithstanding this investigative purpose s 107 is a provision that creates an offence. The sanction is of a serious kind.

Thirdly, the consequence for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition. In considering this provision it is of concern to this Court that an act done by the Commission apparently in the belief it was acting properly could result in a very serous alleged infraction by a police officer going unpunished. The irony of requiring strict compliance to the laws of statute in a case where a police officer is alleged to have flouted proper procedure is not lost on me. Nevertheless statutory provisions creating PIC must be strictly observed.

Finally the intention of Parliament. I have regard to the position of the Local Court, as referred to above. Parliament is obviously capable of discerning the difference between an Australian legal practitioner and other persons who may be granted leave. The fact that the wording of the PIC Act is so precise, militates against this requirement being anything other than a strict one. The provision by Parliament of ss 36 and 37 of the Criminal Procedure Act, ss 57 and 58 of the Local Court Act, show that Parliament is capable of considering such legal niceties as a difference between police and other prosecutors and the requirements or otherwise to have a person described and qualified as an Australian legal practitioner to question witnesses.

The Crown must prove that the proceedings before PIC were valid or not invalidated by the authorisation of Mr Ryan by Commissioner Pritchard purportedly pursuant to s 37 of the PIC Act. If the hearing was not valid then the hearing was a nullity and any evidence given is simply not evidence.""

28Apart from the decision in Project Blue Sky Inc & Ors v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 to which I shall return each of the decisions referred to by her Honour were concerned with an irregularity in the appointment of the person or body in whom a statutory power had been reposed or an irregularity in the decision making process of that body. None of the decisions are concerned with the process by which that body gathered information or ""evidence"" to support its ultimate decision.

29In Ashby an accused person was charged with 11 counts of perjury as a result of evidence given at hearing held under the Police Regulation Act 1958 (Vic). That hearing was conducted by a person who had not received the proper delegation from the Director to conduct a hearing. Osmond J held that the delegation was accordingly invalid and that the answers given on oath before the purported delegate were not answers given on oath before a competent tribunal and the evidence could not amount to perjury.

30In Attorney General of NSW v World Best Holdings Ltd (2005) 63 NSWLR 557 Spigelman CJ said that proceedings before the Administrative Decisions Tribunal miscarried because non judicial members had participated in the proceedings contrary to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997. His Honour held that, because a non judicial member could not participate in the adjudication, the purported act of the tribunal was invalid.

31Difficulties have arisen with the authority of a person prosecuting for an indictable offence. In R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 this Court held that an indictment signed by a person who was not authorised to sign it was invalid and the trial and convictions were accordingly a nullity. The error could not be cured and accordingly as it went to the root of the proceedings those proceedings failed.

32It is instructive for present purposes to be mindful of the remarks of the Chief Justice at [44] where his Honour said:

""Parliament always intends that its procedural stipulations will be complied with. That does not mean that it intends that every failure to comply with such a stipulation has the consequence that events subsequent to the failure are invalid.""

33Before the decision in Project Blue Sky the issue for consideration in this case would have required consideration of whether s 37(2) was mandatory or directory and whether, if mandatory, a failure to comply would have rendered the hearing of the Commission a nullity.

34The contemporary approach to the difficulties occasioned by a failure to comply with a procedural requirement in legislation is found in Project Blue Sky where in their joint judgment McHugh, Gummow, Kirby JJ said at [91]-[93]:

""An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition. Unfortunately, a finding of purpose or no purpose in this context often reflects a contestable judgment. The cases show various factors that have proved decisive in various contexts, but they do no more than provide guidance in analogous circumstances. There is no decisive rule that can be applied; there is not even a ranking of relevant factors or categories to give guidance on the issue. 

Traditionally, the courts have distinguished between acts done in breach of an essential preliminary to the exercise of a statutory power or authority and acts done in breach of a procedural condition for the exercise of a statutory power or authority. Cases falling within the first category are regarded as going to the jurisdiction of the person or body exercising the power or authority. Compliance with the condition is regarded as mandatory, and failure to comply with the condition will result in the invalidity of an act done in breach of the condition. Cases falling within the second category are traditionally classified as directory rather than mandatory. In Pearse v Morrice, Taunton J said ""a clause is directory where the provisions contain mere matter of direction and nothing more"". In R v Loxdale, Lord Mansfield CJ said ""[t]here is a known distinction between circumstances which are of the essence of a thing required to be done by an Act of Parliament, and clauses merely directory"". As a result, if the statutory condition is regarded as directory, an act done in breach of it does not result in invalidity. However, statements can be found in the cases to support the proposition that, even if the condition is classified as directory, invalidity will result from non-compliance unless there has been ""substantial compliance"" with the provisions governing the exercise of the power. But it is impossible to reconcile these statements with the many cases which have held an act valid where there has been no substantial compliance with the provision authorising the act in question. Indeed in many of these cases, substantial compliance was not an issue simply because, as Dawson J pointed out in Hunter Resources Ltd v Melville when discussing the statutory provision in that case: 

""substantial compliance with the relevant statutory requirement was not possible. Either there was compliance or there was not."" 

In our opinion, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales was correct in Tasker v Fullwood in criticising the continued use of the ""elusive distinction between directory and mandatory requirements"" and the division of directory acts into those which have substantially complied with a statutory command and those which have not. They are classifications that have outlived their usefulness because they deflect attention from the real issue which is whether an act done in breach of the legislative provision is invalid. The classification of a statutory provision as mandatory or directory records a result which has been reached on other grounds. The classification is the end of the inquiry, not the beginning. That being so, a court, determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory provision, may easily focus on the wrong factors if it asks itself whether compliance with the provision is mandatory or directory and, if directory, whether there has been substantial compliance with the provision. A better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid. This has been the preferred approach of courts in this country in recent years, particularly in New South Wales. In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to ""the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute"". 

35To my mind it is significant that a hearing under the Act may be conducted by a Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner without the assistance of a legal practitioner appointed by the Commission to assist the Commission as counsel. In that event the Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner could ask questions as may be necessary and can require answers of any witness. The question in the present case is, when questions are asked and answered by a person who could not be authorised to appear at the hearing, whether that hearing is a nullity, with the consequence that although being sworn or having taken an affirmation to tell the truth a person who gives false evidence cannot be prosecuted for a breach of s 107.

36The objects of the Act are concerned with the detection, investigation and prevention of police corruption. To that end the Commission has been constituted and provided with coercive powers which may be exercised in pursuit of an investigation of suspected police corruption and serious police misconduct. The Commission may conduct hearings. At those hearings the Commissioner who is presiding is empowered to require a person to answer questions. Although the questions may be asked by another, the Act contemplates counsel assisting, nevertheless each question is asked with the authority of the Commissioner. The Commissioner is charged with the function of ensuring that the questions are fair to the witness and that procedural fairness is afforded to that person. Although in the present case questions were asked by Mr Ryan, who could not have been authorised to ask them, they were nevertheless questions sanctioned by the Commissioner, who it may be presumed allowed them to be asked and required them to be answered in furtherance of the investigation.

37This analysis is apparent from the terms of the Act. Although s 37(2) provides for the Commission to be assisted by a legal practitioner who may examine or cross examine a witness and s 37(3) provides protection to a witness who is examined or cross examined by that practitioner, s 40 makes plain that any question asked is asked with the authority of the Commissioner or other person presiding at a hearing (s 40(1)(b)). The Act does not otherwise provide for an obligation on a witness to answer questions of counsel assisting or any other person. Accordingly, it may be inferred that even when counsel assisting has been appointed whether a question is actually asked by that person or by the Commissioner the question will be deemed to be a question put to the witness by the Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner.

38Sections 12 and 37(2) provide powers which are given to the Commission to assist it in the furtherance of its investigative function when conducting a hearing. Although the sections regulate the exercise of the function they are not concerned with the constitution of the investigation and are not concerned with the validity of any hearing conducted to assist that investigation.

39The purpose of s 37 is to allow the Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner conducting a hearing to have available the expertise of a legal practitioner to assist in examining a witness. No doubt the legislature was concerned to ensure that a person fulfilling this role was aware of appropriate crucial obligations. However, the legislature would also have been concerned to ensure that any person authorised to assist the Commission had the requisite skills and experience necessary to assist the Commission to efficiently and effectively perform its task. For that reason a legal practitioner trained in asking questions relevant to conduct which was likely to be criminal in nature was seen by the Parliament as necessary. However, this does not have the consequence that when the person given leave to appear at a hearing is not a legal practitioner the hearing itself is a nullity. Although leave could not be granted to Mr Ryan pursuant to s 37 this did not have the consequence that the respondent's answers during the hearing were not evidence capable of amounting to false evidence for the purpose of s 107.

40I would allow the appeal and quash the orders made in the court below.

41HIDDEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

42JOHNSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

		19 April 2013",2011-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757547,R v Paul JAMES [2011] NSWDC 243,"JUDGMENT


1Paul James was prosecuted for a series of child pornography offences. The offences included transmitting child pornography material using a carriage service in an offensive way and possessing child pornography material. There were 17 charges on the indictment. Fifteen of those related to transmitting child pornography material, 1 was using a carriage service in an offensive way and 1 was possessing child pornography material.

2The 15 charges of transmitting child pornography material each specified a date upon which that event occurred. The transmissions were all said by the prosecution to be by email. The use of the carriage service in an offensive way was by way of the use of Facebook. The possession of child pornography material was said to be contained on 2 computers owned by Mr James.

3Mr B Neild of counsel who appeared for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions tendered a series of documents which I marked VDA, VDB and VDC on the voir dire. Mr T Phelan of counsel who appeared for Mr James objected to the tender of that material. These are my reasons for the decision I made last week to admit the material. 

4The main exhibit is VDC which contains a list of emails sent or received by Mr James from three email accounts which he admitted were in his name and which he used. Each of the transmissions or received emails, or almost all of them, related to child pornography material or photographs of Mr James himself in what has been described as various states of undress. 

5Exhibit C comprises a large number of emails, some only of which resulted in charges which appear on the indictment. Others represent transmissions which were not the subject of any charges but which, it seems, could be regarded as criminal activity of a similar kind or of the same kind as that which was charged. 

6Mr Phelan made clear in his opening statement to the jury and throughout the trial that there was no dispute on his client's behalf that the material said to be child pornography material was child pornography material and was offensive. There was no challenge about the transmissions or the presence of such material on his client's computer. 

7What was always in issue in the trial was whether or not it was Mr James who was responsible for the transmission or possession of that material. Mr James' case was that he knew nothing about that material, and somebody else must have been responsible by using his computer. 

8The 15 offences which appeared on the indictment - so far as the emails were concerned - ranged in date from 13 April 2010 to 2 June 2010. The transmissions fell outside and in between those dates. Mr Neild argued that the transmissions other than those on the indictment were relevant and admissible in order to meet a potential defence that someone was operating Mr James' computer over a confined period of time. 

9Exhibit VDC shows material which was sent, being photographs of Mr James himself, from as early as 13 October 2009. The point made by Mr Neild was that it was unlikely that someone else would in some way be using Mr James' computer over such an extended period of time to send material which was linked to child pornography in the sense that the images of himself were sent at the same time as some of the child pornography images which were charged. The level of material which was received by Mr James' email accounts rebutted, so far as Mr Neild argued, a defence that Mr James had no idea that these emails were coming and going through his account. The traffic outside those items charged tends to prove that the person responsible was the account holder, namely, Mr James. 

10Mr Phelan acknowledged the arguable relevance of the material, but asked me to exclude the material under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. He argued that I must refuse to admit it because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to his client. He argued that the additional material does not add a lot to the prosecution case, so that its probative value is slight given the wealth of material which the prosecution already relies upon. Many of the uncharged transmissions were the same as those charged. The material, the subject matter, would be repulsive to almost all members of the community and there would be prejudice flowing to his client. 

11I was of the view that the probative value was more than slight in a case such as this where the accused denies knowledge of the offensive material being transmitted via his computer and suggests that it was somebody else. The longer the period over which the transmissions occurred and the greater the frequency at which they occurred make it in my opinion, as Mr Neild argued, less likely that somebody other than the account owner was responsible. And of course the material will be prejudicial because it demonstrates child pornography being transmitted over a longer period than that charged, but such prejudice is not unfair prejudice in my opinion because it is the same kind of material as that which Mr James has been charged with. The prosecution's argument specifically disavowed any reliance upon tendency. The jury clearly understood that position which is demonstrated by one of the questions which they asked. I do not regard the amount of material as overwhelming. 

12Mr Phelan argued that the additional material might prompt speculation as to why they were not the subject of charges. But such speculation may have assisted his client, and in any event I think it unlikely that it would result in inappropriate speculation because the purposes of it being admitted were clearly argued by Mr Neild and were made the subject of directions by me. 

13They are the reasons that I decided that exhibit VDC on the voir dire should be admissible. 

14Another exhibit on the voir dire demonstrated that one of Mr James' computers was used to do Google searches which produced about nine searches which clearly related to child pornography material. 

15As it happened one of Mr James accounts was a Gmail account and it emerged that his Gmail account automatically keeps searches which are made by Google. Gmail is an email facility provided by Google. Hence the searches of this criminal material were kept - perhaps unwittingly - by Mr James. 

16As Mr Phelan pointed out, Gmail recorded every search whilst it remained open and never deleted any searches. The searches were outside the dates of the charges. The earliest was 30 May 2008. As Mr Phelan correctly pointed out, the specific details about the nine searches do not include any information about who was responsible for performing the searches. Anyone could have done the searches, unlike the emails which showed a sender or a receiver. So, as Mr Phelan pointed out, no one knows if someone else may have accessed the computer and undertaken the searches. The probative value was reduced and the unfair prejudice to his client increased. 

17In my opinion the probative value was significant because it demonstrated that someone using the computer owned by Mr James had an interest in searching for child pornography. The prosecution case was that that person was in fact Mr James. Of course the material is prejudicial in the sense that it tends to point to Mr James' guilt but it was not prejudicial in the sense of being unfairly prejudicial. All it did in my opinion was to reduce the impact of the defence mounted by Mr James that he had no knowledge of that material being on his computer. 

18I accept Mr Neild's argument that it demonstrated a far less likelihood that somebody else than Mr James might have been responsible for using the computer to access child pornography over such a long period of time. As he said, it is likely the person who has the account is the person who did the searches. He made it clear that it was not tendered as tendency evidence and I directed accordingly. 

19For those reasons I decided to admit the other exhibits on the voir dire which went to the searches undertaken on Mr James' computer.

		09 October 2012",2011-08-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757549,R v Mohamed Iqbal Aliwijaya [2011] NSWSC 924,"JUDGMENT - fitness to be tried 

1HIS HONOUR: The accused, Mohamed Ali Iqbal Aliwijaya, is charged with murder. An issue has arisen as to his fitness to stand trial and it is that issue which I must decide today. 

2The offence is said to have occurred whilst he was on remand awaiting trial in the District Court upon a charge of wounding with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. It is alleged that on 23 April 2010 he attacked a cellmate quite brutally, causing his death. 

3For the purpose of today's proceedings I have the benefit of reports of two respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Richard Furst, engaged by the accused's legal representatives, and Professor David Greenberg, engaged by the Crown. 

4To Dr Furst the accused gave an account of the killing which clearly raises a defence of mental illness. Both psychiatrists are of the view that that defence could be available if he were fit to proceed to trial. 

5It is not necessary to recite the evidence on the issue which I must decide in any detail. 

6Dr Furst saw the accused in custody in December last year and January of this year. He obtained a history from the accused, conducted a mental state examination and had regard to other information, including other medical material concerning his psychiatric history. It appears that he has a history of psychosis from at least 2008. He has undergone some treatment before he went into custody and since he has been in custody. 

7Both psychiatrists addressed the issue of fitness to stand trial. Both are experienced forensic psychiatrists well aware of the legal test, which I do not need to set out for present purposes. 

8Dr Furst diagnosed the accused as suffering from schizophrenia of a paranoid type which was treatment-resistant, together with substance abuse disorder. Professor Greenberg arrived at the same conclusion, and I will turn to his reports in just a moment. 

9Dealing first with Dr Furst. When he questioned the accused with a view to determining his fitness to stand trial, he found that the accused understood the charge against him and had some rudimentary, albeit confused, understanding of aspects of the trial process, including the defence of mental illness. 

10The doctor found his understanding of that defence, in particular, to be confused. The doctor spoke of the pleas of guilty, not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental illness and in that context reported that the accused's ""understanding of the three plea options was not particularly logical and did not seem to be linked to an appreciation of whether he would go to trial or not and/or implications for a possible sentence."" 

11A little later in his report the doctor recorded that the accused's ""understanding of the substantial effect of evidence was rudimentary."" The doctor continued: 

""Mr Aliwijaya still had evidence of psychotic symptoms in the form of delusions and hallucinations, which will probably have a bearing on his capacity to pay attention to what was being said and his endurance in the trial. 

He was able to attend to two interviews with myself and will probably be able to explain his version of events to his lawyer and the Court if so required."" 

12Nevertheless, having considered the legal tests, the doctor reported as follows: 

""I was of the opinion that Mr Aliwijaya did not understand the trial process or his plea options sufficiently well, would struggle to endure the trial and was still psychotic. I thought that he was not fit to plead and not fit to be tried."" 

These were Dr Furst's observations in a report of March of this year. 

13Professor Greenberg saw the accused in February of this year and again in June. Concerning the first consultation, the Professor concluded at that stage that the accused was probably suffering from a schizophrenic disorder associated with alcohol and poly-substance abuse. 

14In that report he addressed the issue of fitness to plead, saying that the accused understood the nature of the charge he was facing and in rudimentary terms the difference between a not guilty and a guilty plea. He observed, however, that he had ""some difficulty articulating a defence of mental illness."" 

15The Professor observed the same rudimentary, but somewhat confused, understanding of the trial process. Importantly, however, he expressed this conclusion: 

""At this time I think he would have some difficulty understanding the course of proceedings and the functions of the officers in Court. I am also concerned about his appreciation of the substantial effect of the evidence given in Court at this time. I do, however, feel he is able to decide on what defence he should make, but would have some difficulty in communicating his version of the facts or give evidence, if required to do so, at this time. 

I am of this view because of his current psychotic mental state. He has ongoing hallucinations and delusions of thought control which impact on his ability to integrate knowledge whilst attending Court and communicate his version of the facts."" 

16At the time he wrote the first report, however, Professor Greenberg thought that the accused's mental state might improve and that he may become fit to stand trial. However, he saw him again in June, as I have said, and provided a further report. At that point he agreed with Dr Furst's diagnosis of chronic schizophrenic disorder with treatment-resistant symptoms. He observed him to be still unwell. 

17On the question of fitness to stand trial, his observations of the accused's capacity to understand and participate in the proceedings were not materially different from those he had previously expressed. The doctor expressed the view that he did not understand the nature of the proceedings, and he had this to say: 

""I am of the opinion that based on his current symptomatology, which includes hallucinations and delusions, fairly limited attention span as well as cognitive impairment, he would have difficulty appreciating the substantial effect of evidence. I am of the opinion that he probably could decide on what defence he should make with counsel, and instruct his counsel. However, I am of the opinion that he would have difficulty communicating his evidence if required to do so. Mr Aliwijaya can give an account of himself during the time period surrounding the offences. 

On the balance of probabilities, I am of the opinion that Mr Aliwijaya is currently unfit to plead or stand trial at this time because of his acute psychotic symptoms and his impaired mental state due to his schizophrenic illness. I am of the opinion that he would have difficulty exercising his right to challenge the jurors, to understand the nature of the proceedings and generally understand the course of proceedings, including the functions of the officers and Court. I am also of the opinion that he would have difficulty in appreciating the substantial effect of evidence and also to give evidence if required to do so."" 

18Put shortly, then, the opinions of two respected forensic psychiatrists are the same. It is clear enough that, at least at this stage, this man is not fit to stand trial and I so find. 

19I should add that a fitness hearing was conducted in the District Court where he was to stand trial for the offence of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, and there also his Honour Judge Armitage found the accused to be unfit in a judgment of 28 July of this year. 

(Discussion with counsel.) 

20I find the accused unfit to be tried. Pursuant to s14 (a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 I refer him to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. He is to remain in custody in the meantime.

		19 August 2011",2011-08-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757563,Mark William WALBURN v Alexander Frederick WALBURN [2011] NSWDC 113,"Judgment 

1. The Walburns are a family of three. There is 75 year old Mrs Joan Walburn and she has two sons. Mark is now aged 50 and Alex is now aged 46. 

2. There has been good deal of recent tension between the brothers over their mother's care. The tension has extended to her assets and the ownership of the family home. 

3. There is evidence that Mrs Walburn suffers from a form of dementia which is being treated. She also has other health problems. 

4. Mrs Walburn lived in the family home in Rozelle for many years. There was some discussion in the last few years about selling the house and moving in with her son Alex and his family who live on the south coast. It is apparent that Mark Walburn was not happy with that discussion or that prospect. 

5. Things came to a head on Sunday 21 February 2010. The issue was a very ordinary and innocent one and concerned whether or not Mr Alex Walburn would take Mrs Joan Walburn to the beach. 

6. As it happened there was some discussion around the same time about whether or not Mrs Walburn would sell her house. It appears to be common ground - the evidence is and I accept - that Mrs Walburn made some remark about not intending to sell the house. Mark Walburn latched onto that remark and asked his mother to put it in writing. Alex Walburn's main concern was to get his mother to the beach and he was not concerned about her acknowledging in writing any stated intention about not selling the house. 

7. The situation then deteriorated. The issue caused an eruption of the tension between the brothers. Mrs Walburn was in a bedroom. Mr Mark Walburn stood in the door. He acted in a way that prevented Mr Alex Walburn from going in. Mrs Walburn became upset and distressed. 

8. At one stage the three of them went out towards the car. It was Mr Alex Walburn's intention to go the beach with his mother. Mark Walburn came out. The three of them then went back inside. There was a good deal of loud discussion and conversation. Mr Alex Walburn was so concerned that he called the police. 

9. The police attended the scene. The police officer on the spot was an Officer BurfittWilliams. Officer Burfitt-Williams gave evidence to the following effect, in response to a question from Mr Mark Walburn, who was unrepresented - 
""I do recall telling you, you were acting like children and that it was ridiculous that - at the time I believe I was 25 - that a 25 year old had to tell you guys to grow up."" 


10. As it happened, Mr Mark Walburn's daughter, Amy, was present at the time. When asked whether her grandmother appeared stressed, she acknowledged that she did and appeared to be "" a bit shocked ."" She qualified that answer to say - 
"" Not shocked, just - well, she was kind of used to it because you two would fight quite often, so she just sat there, kind of like, a bit upset really, probably."" 


11. The observations of these two witnesses - who were not the main persons involved - bears out my impression that what had happened on that morning was an eruption of the tension which had been present between the brothers for some time. I do now know how long but it was in existence before that day. 

12. They had been sharing the care of their mother in the sense that she would either stay with Alex on the South Coast or with Mark, usually in her place in Rozelle. 

13. Nevertheless, as a result of that, the evidence is clear that Joan Walburn and Alex Walburn were fearful and upset at Mr Mark Walburn's behaviour, despite Mr Alex Walburn's contribution in the sense, not of being blameworthy, but of engaging in argumentative conduct with his brother. 

14. Just over a week after that incident, something else occurred. There was a visit to the doctor. Mrs Walburn had to go to RPA. Alex Walburn took her. Mark Walburn phoned and had a long conversation with the doctor and then turned up. 

15. Once again, there was an issue which caused tension between them. There was an argument. It concerned the care of their mother. Mr Mark Walburn was obviously getting heated and Mr Alex Walburn was also getting upset at his brother's behaviour. The argument continued out to the car park where Alex Walburn had his car. He was going to take his mother home. Mark Walburn opened the door of the car and continued to talk to his mother. Whether he was shouting at her or talking to her, I am not sure, but Mr Alex Walburn became so frustrated that he drove the car away with the door still open and Mr Mark Walburn trying to talk to his mother. 

16. Mr Mark Walburn was so upset by this that he went to the police. 

17. Once again I am not suggesting that Mr Alex Walburn's behaviour is blameworthy. It was the product, I expect, of a good deal of frustration which existed between the brothers over the issue of their mother and perhaps their mother's estate. 

18. Based upon these two incidents - the first on 21 February 2010 and the second on 1 March 2010 - Mr Alex Walburn and his mother secured from Local Court Magistrate Gilmore, after a hearing of some days, an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order or it may have been an Apprehended Personal Violence Order, which kind does not really matter. It was granted against Mr Mark Walburn. 

19. Mr Mark Walburn has exercised his right to appeal to the District Court against that order and his case came on before me. 

20. When a person appeals to the District Court from an order of this sort, the District Court judge hears the case afresh and makes the kind of order which the District Court judge thinks is the right order. The District Court judge may hear fresh evidence, and in this case fresh evidence was called both before me and before two other judges who were previously involved but disqualified themselves. The judge then makes up his or her own mind about what the appropriate order should be. The judge does not look at the magistrate's judgment in order to see whether it contains any error. The Court of Appeal has said the use of the magistrate's judgment is fairly limited - it may involve matters which the magistrate would have the benefit of observing in court which the judge does not have. 

21. So in this case the question for me is whether I too would grant a Apprehended Personal Violence Order or Apprehended Domestic Violence Order in favour of Mr Alex Walburn and his mother against Mr Mark Walburn. 

22. The test for both orders is essentially the same. I have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Alex Walburn and Mrs Joan Walburn have "" reasonable grounds to fear "", and in fact fear, the commission by Mark Walburn of a personal violence offence against them or the engagement by Mr Mark Walburn in conduct in which he intimidates them or stalks them "" being conduct that, in the opinion of the court, is sufficient to warrant the making of the order."" 

23. I have quoted from the provisions of s16 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 which are in the same terms as s19. The former deals with Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders and the latter with Apprehended Personal Violence Orders. 

24. As a result of the two incidents, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that both Mr Alex Walburn and his mother had reasonable grounds to fear, and in fact feared, the engagement by Mr Mark Walburn in conduct in which they would have been intimidated or felt stalked. The evidence satisfies me that both of them were exhausted by the behaviour of Mr Mark Walburn. 

25. However, I have to be additionally satisfied that it is conduct that, in my opinion, is sufficient to warrant the making of the order. It is that issue which I invited Mr M Finlay, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, to specifically address. 

26. He took me to the evidence in a detailed and helpful way and submitted that it is clear that Mrs Joan Walburn wanted the orders to continue and that she regarded them as being in her interests. He submitted that Mr Alex Walburn is of the same view. Mr Finlay acknowledged the stress between the brothers and argued that Mr Mark Walburn has a fixation on an issue about whether their mother was unduly influenced by his brother Alex. 

27. I make it clear that I make no such finding of undue influence. I do not regard it as particularly relevant to make such a finding nor do I need to determine that issue at all. 

28. Mr Finlay reminded me of the evidence of Alex Walburn that what has occurred since these incidents is that Mrs Joan Walburn has in fact proceeded to sell the house in Rozelle. She has bought property on the South Coast with Alex Walburn and his partner and is living very happily down on the South Coast and becoming engaged with the family and the community and is much more settled. 

29. That is an example of the kind of evidence which can be before a judge on appeal which is different to the evidence before the magistrate because time has moved on and events have occurred which mean that the circumstances have changed. 

30. I am not of the opinion that the conduct which was engaged in by Mark Walburn, on the two occasions relied upon, is such that it is sufficient to warrant the making of an order, either a Apprehended Personal Violence or Apprehended Domestic Violence order. (Mr Finlay argues, and I accept, that both provisions probably apply.) 

31. There is a good deal of evidence from Mr Alex Walburn about his brother's general behaviour being frustrating and annoying and irritating and bullying and intimidating but the evidence is not specific which would enable me to make a finding to the effect that it warranted a continuation of the order. The evidence is directed mostly to events last year. 

32. It is very important in cases such as this, that before a judge makes a significant order restricting the liberty of a person to engage with other members of the community, that the judge is satisfied, on the evidence, that the order is warranted. 

33. In my opinion this matter has been a blow-up of an ongoing issue within the family. It has blown up on a couple of specific occasions that I have heard a good deal of evidence about. Those blow-ups may have warranted the order at the time but in the events that have occurred since then, particularly given Mrs Walburn's move well away from Sydney where Mr Mark Walburn lives to somewhere near Ulladulla, the conduct is no longer sufficient to warrant the making of the order. 

34. Accordingly, I propose to allow Mr Mark Walburn's appeal. The formal orders which I make are made under s20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 in accordance with s84 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal) Violence Act 2007. The orders are that I determine this appeal by Mr Mark Walburn against the making of the Apprehended Violence Order by setting aside the order. 

HIS HONOUR: That is it Mr Mark Walburn you have won your case. The Apprehended Domestic Violence or Apprehended Personal Violence Order is set aside. The exhibits are returned to my associate. I am told that it might take some while - and my associate has this experience from working in the Magistrate's Court - for the appeal to be processed, so give it a few hours or a day or so before you attempt to contact your mother or do anything which might otherwise be regarded as a breach of the order. You do not want to find that the police are not aware of the order which I have just made. I do not think that you could get a cost order because you are self represented but you are not applying for costs, are you? 
APPELLANT: No, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: I think you wanted one of the voir dire exhibits back. 
APPELLANT: Yes. 
HIS HONOUR: I am not sure, my associate will give them to the court officer and you may have a look at them. Ms O'Meagher, anything to add? 
O'MEAGHER: No, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Thank you Ms O'Meagher. Thank you Mr Walburn. You are both excused.

		29 August 2011",2011-08-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757570,Police v Shiu SINGH [2011] NSWLC 23,"JUDGMENT 

Reasons for Decision 

The charge 

1The remaining charge for consideration (another charge was withdrawn on 16 June 2011) is commonly known as ""Public Mischief"" and the Court Attendance Notice pleads that: 

(The accused) on 8 June 2010 at Albury in the State of New South Wales did by means of false statement and conversation knowingly make to a member of the Police Force, a false representation that an event has occurred, that is to say, that the accused, Shiu Singh allege(d) he had been a victim of a robbery between 9.30am and 10.00am on Tuesday 8 June 2010 in Dean Street Albury, which said event as was so represented in such conversation and statement called for an investigation by a member of the Police Force"" contrary to section 547B(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900. 

The allegation 

2Briefly, the allegation before the Court is that the accused reported that he had been robbed in the vicinity of the ANZ Bank in Dean Street, Albury. The prosecution maintain that there was no robbery, and that the report of the robbery was a false report thus leading to the charge before the Court. I will deal with a number of legal directions before going to the facts of the case. 

Legal directions 

3The first and most important direction is the direction on the onus and burden of proof. The charge before the Court is a criminal charge and accordingly before I can find the offence proven I would need to be satisfied of the guilt of the accused and satisfied of that guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The words beyond reasonable doubt are ordinary English words and are to be given their ordinary English meaning. No further elaboration is necessary or desirable. The onus is on the prosecution from beginning to end to prove its case and to prove it beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus whatsoever on the accused. If I refer to the prosecution having to prove something, I am very much aware the standard is the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. 

4As part of the directions on the onus and burden of proof I also direct myself that suspicion, not even the gravest of suspicion can be a substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. 

5As I have already directed myself, there is no onus on the accused. The accused in this matter did not give evidence. Therefore there are a number of essential directions I must give myself, and bear firmly in mind as I embark upon my task in assessing the evidence and determine whether the prosecution has proved its case. 

6The accused is certainly not obliged to give evidence. As the tribunal of fact I cannot and must not draw any inference adverse to the accused by reason of the fact he did not give evidence. The onus is on the prosecution from beginning to end to prove its case and to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. There might be many good reasons why an accused might not give evidence and I must not speculate as to what those reasons might be. The fact that the accused did not give evidence cannot be used by the prosecution, or indeed myself as the tribunal of fact, to plug or fill any gaps or holes in the prosecution case. For more abundant caution I remind and direct myself that no adverse inference can be drawn against the accused because he did not give evidence and that the onus is on the prosecution from beginning to end to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 

7Exhibit 15 in the matter before me is a Record of Interview conducted by police with the accused. That interview made on 8 June 2010 relates to the initial complaint of the robbery. The accused was not a suspect when he was interviewed at that stage. He was arrested on 2 December 2010 and as was his right declined to answer any questions. I direct myself that I must draw no adverse inference against the accused because he exercised his right to silence. Indeed, the right to silence would be utterly meaningless if the situation were otherwise. 

8It is not every syllable that is uttered in the course of evidence or every word that is written in tendered documents that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt. What the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt are the essential elements or essential ingredients of the charge. It appears that the essential ingredients of the charge under consideration are: 

(1)The accused; 
(2)Made a Representation to a member of the police force; 
(3)That such representation was false; 
(4)That such representation required investigation by a member of the police force; and 
(5)At the time the representation was made the accused knew that such representation was false. 

9Section 547B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 relevantly provides: 

(2)For the purposes of subsection (1), a person shall be deemed to make a representation to a police officer if the person makes the representation to any other person and the nature of the representation reasonably requires that other person to communicate it to a police officer and that person does so communicate it. 

10The prosecution at least to some extent it would seem from the prosecutor's submissions, rely on subsection (2) of section 547B, as it was Ms Maree Salter an employee of the ANZ BANK who initially contacted police and made a report of the alleged robbery. The accused however in an interview (Exhibit 15) does give a full account of the alleged robbery. 

11This case is one where the prosecution are relying on inferences. It is appropriate I direct myself in terms that a trial judge would direct a jury on the drawing of inferences. Inferences are conclusions of fact rationally drawn from a combination of proved facts. Inferences may be valid or invalid, justified or unjustified, correct or incorrect. As the matters that I am considering are criminal charges where the prosecution has the onus and burden of proving its case in each matter beyond reasonable doubt, as the tribunal of fact I should be extremely careful about drawing any inference. I should examine any possible inference to ensure that it is a justifiable inference. As these are criminal charges that I am considering, as the tribunal of fact I should not draw any inference from the direct evidence unless it is the only rational inference in the circumstances. 

12The case that the prosecution brings against the accused is essentially circumstantial. In the circumstances of the case, noting that there are competing inferences as it has been presented to me the accused is entitled to a circumstantial evidence direction. The nature of the circumstantial case in the matters presently under consideration is very much in the nature of ""strands of a cable"" rather than ""links in a chain"". A case based on circumstantial evidence may be just as convincing and reliable as a case based on direct evidence, depending on the nature of the circumstances relied upon when considered as a whole (not individually or in isolation) and the degree of clarity and certainty to which that evidence may lead inevitably to the conclusion that the prosecution has established its case. As the tribunal of fact I must not engage in conjecture or speculation. If I draw an inference adverse to the accused and in favour of the Crown, it must be the only inference, which, in my view, can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt. This being a circumstantial case I am unable to return a verdict of guilty on the charge before the court unless I am of the opinion the guilt of the accused on the circumstantial evidence is not only an available conclusion but also the only rational and reasonable conclusion on the evidence. 

13In the matter presently under consideration the practical reality is that the prosecution have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was no robbery. 

The evidence 

14The photographs annexed to the statement of Const. Knobel (Exhibit 7) clearly show the area of Dean Street around the ANZ Bank. 

15The matter proceeded before me with the tender of a significant number of statements. There was brief cross-examination of only one of the witnesses, namely Ms Maree Salter who was at the relevant time the acting Branch Manager of the ANZ Bank in Dean Street, Albury. Both advocates have provided extensive written submissions, to which I will later refer. 

16Ms Sue Miller on 8 June 2010 was working as a Business Banking Teller at the ANZ Bank at 579 Dean Street, Albury. Not long after the bank opened for business at 9.30am she saw an Indian man (it is uncontroversial that the man was the accused) sitting in a chair in the customer service area. When approached the accused indicated that he wished to see the Manager. Ms Miller at about 10.15am approached Ms Maree Salter who as at 8 June 2010 was employed as a Senior Personal Banker at the ANZ Bank. She was also acting as relieving Branch Manager. Ms Salter then went to where the accused was seated and introduced herself to him. She recognised him as a customer of the bank, and she invited him into her office, which invitation Mr Singh accepted. 

17Ms Salter noticed that Mr Singh appeared to be holding his head with one of his hands. The following is then recorded in paragraph 9 of Ms Salter's police statement (Exhibit 32): 

""I asked Mr. Singh is everything okay and he said words similar to the effect of, 'I've just been robbed'. I recall that he also said he had been attacked. Mr. Singh kept telling me that they had hurt his finger by bending it backwards. He kept repeated the same words, ""'my finger is sore and my head hurts'"". 

18It was Ms Salter who initially contacted the Albury Police Station and reported the alleged robbery. 

19Before contacting the police Ms Salter inquired as to whether Mr Singh had a deposit book. Mr Singh produced a deposit book, which is Exhibit 35 in the proceedings. The deposit book relates to account [xxxx xxxxx] at the ANZ Bank at 177 Merrylands Road, Merrylands. The first entry in that book relates to a deposit made on 3 May 2010. There is a deposit slip and the stub thereof completed for 8 June 2010 for a sum of $4600. This is the amount of money that the accused maintains was taken from him by the assailant. The previous amounts deposited were $63.60, $257.05, $171.80, $350.00, $15.55, $350.00, $73.40, and $608.00. 

20Ms Salter noticed that while speaking to the accused he did not have any ""urgency"" when he was talking to her. He was ""agitated by did not have a sense of urgency considering the sum of money that was stolen"". Mr Singh told bank staff a number of times that his head hurt and ""they bent his finger back"". He also told bank staff that he was carrying the money in a plastic coin bag. 

21Ms Salter then recounts (paragraph 12 of her statement, Exhibit 32) that the accused told her that he parked his car across the road from the bank and then he walked across the road in front of the Albion Hotel, he got to the front somebody hit him from behind. She believes that the accused told her that his car was red. 

22Further, Ms Salter recounts that she asked the accused if he wanted the police contacted. According to Ms Salter (paragraph 13, Exhibit 32) the accused said words to the effect that he felt uncomfortable speaking to the police and that he would walk around to the police station. She persuaded him that the police should be contacted. 

23The accused told Ms Salter (see paragraph 16, Exhibit 32) that he was outside the Albion Hotel when he got hit on the head; the person that robbed him was wearing a black hooded jumper and jeans and was approximately 20 years old. He also said that after he was robbed the saw the person run towards the Botanical Gardens. 

24Ms Salter in her statement made about 8 months after the events maintains that she thought the amount of money stated on the deposit slip was about $6,000 but conceded under cross examination that the deposit slip that she saw could well have been the one for $4,600 dated 8 June 2010 to which I have previously referred. She was not able to say for certain that Exhibit 35 was in fact the deposit book that she saw on the morning of 8 June 2010. 

25Police and Ambulance Officers arrived at the scene. I will return later in these reasons to the observations of the emergency services personnel who attended the bank on the morning of 8June 2010. 

26Senior Constables Krooglik and McCaig were the first police officers to speak to the accused - see Exhibits 5 and 6. The accused told those officers that he had a sore head at the back and that his hand was a bit sore. Constable Krooglik arranged for the attendance of the ambulance. When asked what happed, the accused told Constable Krooglik: 

""I was walking from my car to do some banking here and suddenly felt a big bump to the back of my head. It stunned me a bit and I saw a person on my left hand side. He was grabbing at my left hand where I had the banking money in a plastic coin bag and pulled it out of my hand and then ran away"". 

27When asked to describe his assailant, the accused told Constable Krooglik: 

""I'm not sure, he had dark clothing, a dark top with a hood, medium build, dark trousers and you could see the top of his underpants as he ran away"". 

28The accused told police that the money was from superannuation funds in Fiji. 

29Detective Kelly extensively interviewed the accused about the allegation. The transcript of the interview is Exhibit 15. It is important to remember that this interview was made at a time when police believed the accused to be a victim of a robbery. Part of the answer to question 4 in the interview is: 

""Well, this morning when I was going to ANZ Bank to deposit case, $4,600, I parked my vehicle almost I think it was just before 10 o'clock near Albion Hotel and then when I got out, as soon as I started walking about a couple of metres from the car, somebody hit me from behind my head, I almost got unconscious. I had that cash in plastic bag in my left hand and the person who hit me forced to take that money out. Unfortunately I tried to pull back but he forced and during that I got my finger a little bit injured and because of the impact on my head I could see the stars and I couldn't do much, I just had to release the hand and the guy ran away with the money..."" 

30The accused repeated the description that he had earlier given to Constable Krooglik. He went on to tell police (q 29) that he had $45,000 in a term deposit, and that he had recently withdrawn $5,000. The account was opened in the Merrylands Branch of the ANZ initially with $72,000, which is what he had in Australian dollars after the conversion - see generally answers to questions 40 and following. He said he left home about 9.35am (q 58). In answer to question 83 he repeated what he had earlier said about being attacked within a couple of metres of his car. He did not see anyone in front of him (q 83). The accused said that he only ever saw his assailant from the back (q 162). 

31In answer to question 94 the accused said: 

""And then I went to the bank, I was very painful but I told the bank then from the bank I did not want to report to the police but I thought it's not necessary to report because one time I pull over the car as I told you before, then I was told that it's not a police case, it's a big country and this kind of thing you need to take care of yourself"". 

32In the same vein, he said in answer to question 195: 

""It's my personal money. It's not a problem actually. I didn't want to give any problem to the police and no use reporting because its not even insured, I can't get anything, but because..."" 

33In answer to question 123 he said: 

""And it was very painful honestly speaking. And ah, I got almost unconscious but I just try to, you know, hold it on my right hand and I think because of that I got all this pain, pain again."" 

34Then at question 128: 

""No, because he was trying to take the, grab the bag but I hold it so hard, I could feel it because when I was hit I knew exactly that something is going to happen with me, the...I tried to hold...person really forced to take the money out."" 

35On a number of occasions the accused described a struggle with his assailant grabbing for the money and him resisting which was the means by which his fingers were injured. 

36Further, on the issue of the actual assault on him the accused said in answer to question 245: 

""Because, because if the fist, I can fell that, I mean, fist that somebody hit there, bit it was just like some broke off piece of wood or something kind of thing, see, 'cause it was flat, hit like that there. Unless he got a very hard, you know, thump...I don't know"" 

37The answer to question 245 is quite unclear. The accused places a qualification on the issue of the use of a weapon by his assailant. I could not conclude that the accused was positively asserting that his assailant used a weapon of some description. 

38In answer to question 213 and continuing the accused explained that the money he had was from withdrawals previously made, one in $1,500 and the other in $3,500. Exhibit 21 is a collection of bank statements in fact showing that the accused withdrew $1,500 on 3 May 2010 and $3,500 on 13 May 2010. This supports the version of the accused as to how he came by the money said to have been taken from him on the morning of 8 June 2010. 

39One of the many curious aspects of this case is that the accused seemed reluctant to have the police involved. The clear import of the contents of paragraphs 13 and 14 of Ms Salter's statement (Exhibit 32) is that the accused was reluctant to have the police involved. When Detectives Martin and Kelly went to speak to the accused on 10 June 2010 he was clearly reluctant to talk to them. On 9 June 2010 the accused hand-wrote a letter addressed to Detective Kelly, which the detective obtained from the ANZ Bank. That letter is Exhibit 18. In the letter the accused requests that the police cease any investigation into the matter, that there were false reports on the local electronic media, that he is afraid that he will be recognised as there are very few Fijian Indians in East Albury. Further, there appears in the letter: 

""Anyway it was not me who rang the police, it was the courtesy of the ANZ Staff as I knew that it may cause unnecessary havoc"". 

40I now return to the evidence of Ms Maree Salter, the relieving Branch Manager at the ANZ Bank. The accused handed the letter a copy of which is Exhibit 18 to Ms Salter. The accused went on to say to Ms Salter that on the night of 8 June somebody went to his house and threatened him with the words, ""drop the charges or else"". It was put to Ms Salter in cross-examination that those words were not said, but she was not shaken on that aspect of her evidence. It was also put to her that the accused said that someone rang his house and said words to the effect of if you report this to the police your house will be burnt down. Ms Salter gave evidence to the effect that she did not remember the accused saying that. 

41Dr Julian Dart examined the accused at the Emergency Department of the Albury Base Hospital at 11.13am on 8 June 2010 - see Exhibit 16. The accused was alert and oriented to time and place, there was no bruising or laceration to the scalp and the left fourth index finder was slightly tender. Photographs were taken of the accused (Exhibit 23) but those photographs are so unclear they do not assist in any way in determining an issue. 

42On the issue of medical treatment, Mr Wayne Robinson, an ambulance officer treated the accused at the ANZ Bank on the morning of 8 June 2010. From the annexure to Mr Robinson's statement it appears that the call for assistance was received at 10.25am and the ambulance arrived at the scene at 10.44am. Mr Robinson examined the accused and found that he was alert, talking, orientated to time and place and was well perfused (had good colour). He examined the accused's head by running his fingers through his hair and over his head and could not feel any bumps. He could not see any bleeding or bruising to his head and face. It was recorded on the patient health care record, ""nil haematoma or bleeding detected on head"". 

43Neither Dr Dart nor Mr Robinson were called to give oral evidence, and accordingly, the full extent of their evidence upon which I must make a determination is contained within their statements and the documents annexed thereto. For example there is no expert evidence as to the extent of force required to produce any observable injuries or bruising. The medical evidence it seems to me was potentially very important in this matter. This is one aspect of the case where I would have been very much assisted by oral evidence from either or both the treating doctor and ambulance officer. This is not a matter about which I can take judicial notice. Nor can I rely on my own knowledge obtained from my experience in other cases - see the decision of the High Court of Australia in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21. It seems to me that this is precisely what the prosecutor is suggesting that I do. In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar, French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ said at [47]: 

Whatever may be the position with respect to other tribunals, the statutory requirement that, subject to certain limited exceptions, none of which was engaged here, the Dust Diseases Tribunal apply the rules of evidence compels the conclusion that the primary judge erred when he said that he was permitted to take his experience into account in determining what caused Mr Hawchar's silicosis. To the extent to which earlier decisions of the Court of Appeal concerning the Dust Diseases Tribunal hold to the contrary, they should be overruled. Under the rules of evidence the primary judge was permitted to take account of matters not proved in evidence in this case only if they were matters of which judicial notice could be taken. It was not suggested that the causes of silicosis were matters for judicial notice. 

The degree of force to produce any particular injury is likewise a matter about which I am unable to take judicial notice. If the prosecution were relying on this issue then either oral should have been called to expand upon the written statements and certificates, or additional and more comprehensive written statements should have been obtained. 

44Exhibits 24, 25 and 26 are downloads of CCTV footage taken from the ANZ Bank, the Commercial Club and the Albion Hotel. The Commercial Club is on the opposite side of Dean Street to the ANZ Bank, and is further to the west. The Albion Hotel is on the same side of Dean Street, but a few doors to the west. The footage is neutral, and does not assist one way or the other. 

45On 8 June 2010 police conducted a thorough canvass of personnel working in businesses in the near vicinity of the ANZ Bank. Nothing more could have been done in this regard by the police. The evidence of these people, namely Weronika Raczkowska, Kristine Reif, and Annette Wood do not assist one way or the other. Likewise, Mr Cunningham, a taxi driver who was in his vehicle at a rank opposite the ANZ Bank, did not see anything. The fact that those people observed nothing on 8 June 2010 does not prove that the robbery did not occur, nor does it allow such an inference to be made. 

Submissions of the parties 

46Both the prosecutor and counsel for the accused have provided extensive written submissions. Initially, the prosecutor points to a number of inconsistencies in the various accounts given by the accused. The accused is a Fijian Indian, and he told police in the electronic interview taken on 8 June 2010 that he had been the Circulation Manager for a newspaper in Fiji. It is tolerably plain from reading the interview that the accused, while obviously very fluent in English, does not speak perfect English. The inconsistencies are in my view minor. 

47The prosecutor submits that it is significant that Ms Howard, an employee at Howard's Storage World, one of the nearby businesses says, ""The man stepped on to the footpath and was walking in the direction of the ANZ Bank. The next time I saw this man was when he was receiving attention from Police and Ambulance officers."" With respect, this does not in my opinion assist the prosecution case. The accused was in the bank complaining of the robbery at or about 10am. The ambulance was there at 10.44am. The situation with Ms Howard's evidence is the same as those of the persons who worked in other nearby businesses. The observations of those various persons are not such that a robbery as alleged could not have taken place. Again, the fact that they did not see something occur to Mr Singh cannot lead to an inference that nothing in fact occurred. 

48Ms Salter observes that the accused did not appear to have any urgency. The accused was always reluctant to have the matter reported. 

49The prosecutor then submits that Det. Kelly makes observations that Mr Singh does not have any obvious injuries. I merely repeat what I have earlier said in these remarks on the issue of medical evidence. The same observations apply to the submissions on the medical evidence and that of the ambulance officer. I also note that Dr Taylor was the author of the medical report, but it was another doctor who actually examined the accused. 

50The prosecutor submits that ""the court would have to question why Mr Singh did not add the $200 in his wallet to the amount of $4,600 making it closer to the full amount he wished to put back"". It is further submitted that there are several issues relating to the banking habits of Mr Singh. A thorough examination of the banking records does not reveal any particular habit or pattern. Certainly, I agree with the prosecutor that there are some aspects of the financial records and dealings at the Commercial Club that are ""strange"". However, I do not think this greatly assists the prosecution. There many explanations as to why people do what they do with money. In dealing with this submission it is important to remind myself on the direction given earlier in these reasons on drawing of inferences, and further, that I cannot engage in speculation. 

51I must however congratulate the prosecutor on very thorough, thoughtful and helpful submissions. Rarely does the court receive such assistance in matters before the Local Court. 

52Mr Blackman's submissions are also very thorough and helpful. Perhaps one of the most important points made by Mr Blackman is that none of the CCTV footage that makes up Exhibits 24, 25, and 26 actually covers the area where the robbery is said to have taken place. This blunts the prosecutor's submissions about the likelihood of something of relevance being captured. 

53It is submitted on behalf of the accused that the prosecution have not proved any motive. The prosecution do not have to prove any motive. In the recent decision of Chand v R [2011] NSWCCA 53, Hoeben J (McClellan CJ at CL, Blanch J agreeing) said [96]-[97]: 

In relation to whether a direction was required from his Honour as to motive, Coumbe v The Queen (1990) 101 FLR 466 is not authority that a motive direction needs to be given in every case that motive evidence is led. De Gruchy v The Queen (2002) 211 CLR 85 is to similar effect. What those cases make clear is that the question of whether a direction as to motive should be given depends upon the particular facts of the case. 

97 In De Gruchy Kirby J said: 

""52 Judicial instructions on motive: It follows from the foregoing that a number of general propositions can be accepted to guide judges in the consideration of whether they should give instructions to a jury concerning motive, where that issue has arisen as a live one in the course of the trial, and if so in what terms: 

(1) No general direction can be formulated to accommodate all the different circumstances that can arise. If any directions are given on the subject of motive, they should be brief because the consideration of the relevance of motive (or lack of it) is quintessential^ a task for the jury, viewing questions about motive in the context of the evidence as a whole. 

(2) Where the prosecution has not sought, or has failed, to prove a motive on the part of the accused for the crime, the judge may consider whether it is appropriate to make it clear to the jury that the prosecution has no obligation to show a possible motive and that the absence of a proved motive cannot as a matter of law be fatal to its case. Sometimes the precise motives of individuals (if any) will never be known to anyone other than themselves. In such circumstances, it would be completely unreasonable to require the prosecution to prove a motive and the law does not impose that obligation. 

(3) Where a motive of some kind is proved by the evidence, but it appears a trivial one, disproportionate to the crime alleged, it may be proper for the judge to draw such disproportion to the notice of the jury, in fairness to the accused, given that ""[t]he stronger the motive the more influence it is likely to have [on the jury]"". On the other hand, the judge may also point out that proportion in such matters will sometimes be absent. To reasonable and law abiding citizens many serious crimes appear to have been committed upon trivial motives, wholly disproportionate to the gravity of the wrong. 

(4) Where the prosecution has established strong evidence of a motive, it will often be necessary to warn the jury that they must look at all the circumstances of the case and not be unduly affected by the evidence that the accused had a motive to commit the crime. This is because of the fact that many who have powerful motives to offend never do so. Motivation is simply one item of the evidence in the case that may tend to show that a particular person committed an alleged act. The jury may therefore need to be reminded that allowance should be made for the fact that having a motive, and even expressing it, does not, as such, constitute proof of involvement in a crime. 

(5) Where there is no evidence that the accused had a motive to commit the crime alleged, that is ""always a fact in favour of the accused"". There is some authority to suggest that a trial judge need not draw that fact to the notice of the jury. However, especially in circumstances of a heinous crime, if a judge gives any direction about motive, it would generally be fair and prudent to draw to the jury's notice the absence of proved motive as a consideration favouring the accused. As Griffith CJ observed: ""the more heinous the act... the more important becomes the question of motive."" If none is proved, that is a consideration that the jury will need to weigh in judging whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused to the criminal standard. 

(6) Nonetheless, if any such comment is made, it should be balanced by drawing attention to the obvious fact that, in a particular case, ""there may be a motive, and perhaps a strong one, but no evidence of it available"". In Pointer v United States, the Supreme Court of the United States put it this way: ""The absence of evidence suggesting a motive for the commission of the crime charged is a circumstance in favour of the accused, to be given such weight as the jury deems proper; but proof of motive is never indispensable to conviction."""" 

54Both parties submit that the reluctance of the accused to have the police involved assists their case. Constable McCaig noticed that the accused was upset, was crying and said, ""this only happens in my country"". The reluctance of the accused to have the police involved in the matter is one of the many strange and unusual aspects of this case. In the absence of any motive such as an insurance claim, the issue of the reluctance of the accused to have the police involved is of greater assistance to the accused. 

55As Mr Blackman correctly submits, it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the robbery did not occur, not for the accused to prove on balance that it did. I merely observe that proving beyond reasonable doubt that something did not happen is a particularly difficult task to achieve. 

56There are many strange and unusual aspects to this case, some in fact bordering on the bizarre. I must admit to a degree of prevarication and wavering in deciding this case. That in itself leads to a conclusion that I should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. The matters urged by the prosecution, as set out in summary form at the conclusion of the prosecutor's submission are matters of significance, and give the court considerable cause to consider. There are three aspects in particular, however, that cause me have a doubt. One is the lack of medical evidence, secondly there is (in the context of this case) a lack of any motive to make a false complaint, and the other is the banking records indicating substantial withdrawals close in time to 8 June 2010, indicating a possible source of the funds the accused maintained he had with him on that morning. 

Conclusion and formal orders 

57There is most certainly a prima facie case, and I do not understand Mr Blackman to submit otherwise. However, after consideration of all of the evidence, the very thorough and helpful submissions from both advocates, and the various warnings that I gave myself at the beginning of these reasons, while I entertain considerable suspicion, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. Accordingly, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. 

58My formal orders are that I enter a verdict and judgment of acquittal and the accused is discharged in respect of the matter before the court.

		16 August 2011",2011-08-11 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2757582,Regina v Shawn Darrell Richard [2011] NSWSC 866,"Judgment 

1For nearly four years between November 2005 and September 2009, whilst a director of Astarra Asset Management Pty Limited, and other companies in the Trio Capital Group, and whilst engaged in the financial services industry, Mr Richard dishonestly operated the business in a way which was designed to, and had the effect of, diverting the staggering large sum of $26.6m which was invested in superannuation funds in Australia, into overseas funds which were located in tax havens in the Caribbean. These overseas funds were of questionable value and were wholly inappropriate superannuation investments. 

2Mr Richard obtained a significant financial benefit for himself for his participation in this dishonest business. He was paid a net annual salary of over $110,000 and he received over $1.3m in extra payments to him personally from his conduct of the business. Astarra Asset Management, a company of which he was a director, received $5.3m. Mr Richard's conduct was manifestly dishonest, continued over a significant period and only came to light when the Trio Capital Group failed. At all times, Mr Richard knew that he was acting dishonestly. None of the $26.6m has been recovered. It has all been lost. 

3On 3 December 2010, Mr Richard signed a statement to which was attached a 32 page Statement of Facts and related documents, the truth of which Mr Richard admitted. He was issued with two Court Attendance Notices in respect of three offences 

4On that day, he also entered into an Enforceable Undertaking with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Ex C) in which he undertook, in accordance with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, not to provide financial services in Australia permanently. 

5On 7 December 2010, when he appeared before the Local Court of New South Wales, Mr Richard entered a plea of guilty in respect of the two charges contained in the Court Attendance Notice and admitted a third charge in the second Court Attendance Notice. He was committed for sentence in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. 

6On 4 March 2011, an indictment was presented in the Supreme Court and Mr Richard pleaded guilty to the offences in the indictment. On Friday 22 July 2011, submissions were made on behalf of the Crown and Mr Richard with respect to the appropriate sentence to be imposed. 

7It is now time for Mr Richard to be sentenced for his crimes. 

Judicial Task on Sentencing 
8In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing. 

9In the system of criminal justice which operates throughout Australia, as the sentencing judge, I am obliged to exercise a wide discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Richard by applying well identified principles of law to the facts which are agreed, and which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at [1]-[2]; House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. 

10Because the offences to which Mr Richard has pleaded guilty involve contraventions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and are thereby offences against a federal statute, the sentence to be imposed upon Mr Richard must be determined, in the exercise of federal jurisdiction by this Court, in accordance with Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

11However, it needs to be kept in mind that Part 1B is not 

""...an exhaustive statement of the will of the Parliament with respect to sentencing for federal offences"": 

Putland v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 174 at [53] per Gummow and Heydon JJ (Callinan J agreeing). 

12Common law principles of sentencing apply to the sentencing of federal offenders: Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at [15]. 

13This is because of the words used in section 16A(1) of the Crimes Act , namely: 

""In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence."" 

14In DPP (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Kirby P, Campbell and Newman JJ) said at [378C]: 

""[Section] 16A(1) imposes on the Court the duty, which is its primary obligation, to ensure that the sentence or order 'is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence'. It is by this duty that the general principles of sentencing law are imported into the function of a court imposing a sentence on a Federal offender convicted of the offence. What will be 'appropriate' will depend, in part, upon a consideration of fundamental notions, such as that of general deterrence."" 

15The Court is obliged to take into account the matters specified in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act that are relevant to the particular sentencing exercise being undertaken. The Court is entitled to take into account other matters which accord with developed legal principles. 

16Of s 16A(2), the Court of Criminal Appeal said in El Karhani at [378E]: 

""The list of particular considerations in s 16A(2) must be read as subject to the primary obligation of the court stated in s 16A(1). All that s 16A(2) requires is that the court should 'take into account' the listed matters. They provide a catalogue of matters to be considered in determining the 'severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence'. However, the opening words of s 16A(2) must be noted. They state that the matters there listed are to be taken into account 'in addition to any other matters'. These words make it plain beyond argument that the legislature was not seeking, by the list, to exclude other relevant matters. One other such relevant matter is clearly the general deterrent effect of the sentence."" 

General Deterrence 
17The principle of general deterrence is of particular importance in relation to offences such as those to which Mr Richard has pleaded guilty and which are commonly referred to by the rubric "" white collar offences "": R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330. 

18What the principle of general deterrence involves, and why it is an important and relevant matter for a sentencing court to take into account, is well explained in R v Radich [1954] NZLR 86 at 87 by the Court of Appeal in New Zealand when it said this: 

""...one of the main purposes of punishment...is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender and to other persons with similar impulses that, if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment. In all civilized countries, in all ages, that has been the main purpose of punishment, and it still continues so. The fact that punishment does not entirely prevent all similar crimes should not obscure the cogent fact that fear of severe punishment does, and will, prevent the commission of many that would have been committed if it was thought that the offender could escape without punishment, or with only a light punishment. If a Court is weakly merciful, and does not impose a sentence commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, it fails in its duty to see that the sentences are such as to operate as a powerful factor to prevent the commission of such offences. On the other hand, justice and humanity both require that the previous character and conduct, and probable future life and conduct of the individual offender, and the effect of the sentence on these, should also be given the most careful consideration, although this factor is necessarily subsidiary to the main considerations that determine the appropriate amount of punishment."" 

19This passage has been cited with approval by Courts in Australia: R v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594 at [598C]; R v Kane [1974] VR 759 at 764765. 

Other relevant specific matters 
20Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 914 obliges the court to take account of a number of particular matters if relevant. It will be convenient to summarise them in this way: 

(d)Matters relating to the objective features of the offence, such as the nature and circumstances of the offence (s 16A(2)(a)), whether the offence is part of a course of conduct (s 16A(2)(c)) and the extent of loss or damage caused by the conduct (s 16A(2)(e)); 

(e)Matters relating to the subjective features of the offender, such as the character, age and state of health of the offender (s 16A(2)(m)), the post offence conduct of the offender including showing contrition, pleading guilty and providing assistance to authorities (ss 16A(2)(f)-(h)), specific deterrence (s 16A(2)(j)) and prospects of rehabilitation (s 16A(2)(n)); 

(f)Matters relating to adverse effects upon others of the conduct or the consequences of it, such as the personal circumstances of the victims of an offence (s 16A(2)(d)) and the effect on an offender's family or dependents of any sentence imposed (s 16A(2)(p)). 

Offences 
21Mr Richard has pleaded guilty to two offences contrary to section 1041G(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that: 

Charge 1: 

Between about 15 November 2005 and about 30 June 2009 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales in the course of carrying on a financial services business did engage in dishonest conduct in relation to financial services knowing that conduct to be dishonest. 

Charge 2: 

Between about 8 October 2007 and about 30 September 2009 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales in the course of carrying on a financial services business did engage in dishonest conduct in relation to financial services knowing that conduct to be dishonest. 

22It is to be observed that, with the exception of the date, the charges are in identical terms. The facts and circumstances, to which I will come, are quite different. 

23Mr Richard has also admitted his guilt in respect of a further offence contrary to section 1041E(1) of the Corporations Act that: 

Between about 15 February 2006 and 30 September 2009 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales did make statements which were materially misleading, and known by him to be materially misleading, that were likely to induce persons in Australia to acquire financial products. 

He asks that this offence be taken into account pursuant to section 16BA of the Crimes Act in passing sentence on him for the first offence to which he has pleaded guilty. 

24At the time that these offences were committed, each of them carried a penalty of a maximum term of imprisonment of five years and as well the possibility of a fine of up to $220,000. That is the maximum penalty which it is appropriate for me to consider. However, I note that since the time when these offences were committed, these penalties have been doubled by the Parliament, so that the maximum penalty for each offence is now 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $495,000: s 1311 Corporations Act and Schedule 3 of the Act. 

25However, a sentence of imprisonment is not to be imposed unless I am satisfied ""... that no other sentence is appropriate in the circumstances"" : s 17A(1) of the Crimes Act . 

The Facts 
26The evidence included a lengthy 32 page Statement of Facts. The findings which follow are a summary of those complex facts. Although I have provided only a summary of the facts in this judgment, I have had careful regard to the whole of the Statement of Facts, which I find are the facts which form the basis of the sentences to be imposed. 

27Mr Richard is a Canadian national, resident in Australia. At all relevant times, he was carrying on financial services business in this jurisdiction within the terms of s 1041G for the Corporations Act . 

28To understand the offences committed by Mr Richard, it is necessary to outline the framework of corporate and managed funds entities within which these offences occurred. This framework consisted of numerous holding and subsidiary companies, often changing names, traversing international jurisdictions beyond Australia, including the United States of America and those within Asia, the Caribbean and Pacific Islands. It is convenient to refer to the entire group as the Trio Capital Group. 

29Only the key entities through which Mr Richard operated to commit the offences need to be described. A convenient starting point is the Astarra Strategic Fund (""ASF""), as the dishonest conduct of Mr Richard relates to transactions that all have their genesis in ASF. 

30ASF was a managed investment fund, registered with ASIC, which was wound up by the Court on 19 March 2010. 

31The responsible entity for ASF was Trio Capital Ltd (""Trio""). Trio was also the responsible entity for other managed investment schemes and, as well, the trustee for five superannuation entities (collectively the ""Trio Managed Funds""). Mr Richard was, at various times, a director and the responsible officer and agent of Trio. Mr Richard was a director of Trio's immediate holding company, Astarra Funds Management Pty Ltd (""AFM""). At all relevant times, Mr Richard falsely represented that he was a director and owner of Trio's ultimate holding company. Trio was put into liquidation on 22 June 2010. 

32The investment manager of ASF, via agreements with Trio, was Astarra Asset Management Pty Ltd (""AAM""). Mr Richard was a director of AAM. In addition, AAM was an authorised representative of Trio and Wright Global Investments Pty Ltd (""WGI""). I have already described Mr Richard's relationship with Trio. With respect to WGI, he was a director and the responsible officer. Mr Richard also falsely represented that he was a director and owner of AAM and WGI's ultimate holding companies. AAM was wound up on 22 December 2009. 

33EMA International Ltd (""EMA"") was a special purpose vehicle established to facilitate investments by ASF in funds offshore. Mr Richard was in control of EMA. 

34It is admitted by Mr Richard that he represented himself to investors as being the controller of Trio, WGI and AAM, in circumstances where Mr Richard was aware that these representations were false. The representation was false because at all times after July 2004, Mr Richard knew that Mr Jack Flader, a US citizen based in Hong Kong, was the ultimate controller of these entities and the business of the Trio Capital Group. 

35Mr Richard used his positions with respect to AAM, Trio, WGI and AFM to arrange the transfer of Australian investors' monies from Trio Managed Funds in Australia, to overseas funds controlled by Flader (""Flader Controlled Funds""). The money was subsequently used to purchase shares in US companies at inflated prices, from foreign companies controlled by Flader (""Flader Vendor Companies""). The inflated share prices realised significant profits for the Flader Vendor Companies. 

36The shares which were purchased were themselves only quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board as unregulated US equity securities. This meant that they were vulnerable to share price manipulation, and often, there was only restricted stock available for trading. 

37From November 2006, when the directors of Trio became concerned and decided to cease its exposure to a particular Flader Controlled Fund (the Exploration Fund), Mr Richard participated in the creation of new offshore funds for Trio to invest in, all of which were controlled by Flader. He falsely represented to Trio and ASF investors that he was diversifying the portfolio to different investment managers from the original Flader Controlled Funds. 

38The GSCL Group, of which Mr Flader was the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, was the custodian of the assets of the Flader Controlled Funds at all material times. In addition, the GCSL Group, provided administration services to EMA. 

39The only monies invested into the Flader Controlled Funds were those from the Trio Managed Funds, with two exceptions. The Australasian Conference Association Superannuation Trust and the Australian Baseball Federation Inc. directly invested in one of the Flader Controlled Funds. 

40A large proportion of profits received by the Flader Vendor Companies, from the sale of shares purchased from Australian investors' monies deposited into the Flader Controlled Funds, were subsequently used to provide funds to Trio, WGI, AFM and AAM, by way of loans from other companies controlled by Flader (""Flader Funding Companies""). Mr Richard falsely represented to auditors of Trio, WGI, AFM and AAM that he controlled these funding companies. 

41Mr Richard did not disclose to, and took steps to actively conceal from, Trio or investors in Trio Managed Funds, his relationship with Mr Flader, the existence of the interrelated network of companies and investment funds and his personal financial advantage from the activities of the Trio Capital Group. 

42Furthermore, the non-equity investments that contributed a substantial portion of the value of the Flader Controlled Funds were also problematic. Between at least April 2007 to 5 October 2009, Mr Richard was aware that the financial instruments setting up the derivatives, foreign exchange agreements and fixed interest investments had not been verified regarding their execution, ability of counterparties to honour the obligations nor their independent value. This was largely due to the fact that they were also obtained from Flader companies. 

43Against this general description of the companies in the Trio Capital Group and the nature of the transactions, it is appropriate to now examine the particular facts which relate to the charges. The facts forming the basis of the specific charges are as follows. 

Charge One 
44Charge One refers to dishonest conduct by Mr Richard whereby on two separate occasions he arranged for over $16.2m of ASF and superannuation monies to be paid into Flader Controlled Funds, in circumstances where AAM received payments of over $5.3m to further the scheme, and Mr Richard personally received payments of over $1.3m. 

45The liquidators of ASF have not been unable to recover any of the monies from Trio Managed Funds that were invested in the Flader Controlled Funds. 

46There are two discrete sets of facts and circumstances relied upon by the Crown, to prove this charge. They are both admitted by Mr Richard. 

Circumstance A (15 November 2005 - 14 December 2005) : 
47Mr Richard, as agent for Trio and director of AAM and WGI, arranged for ASF and Astarra Superannuation Plan to invest $3m and $3.559m respectively, in shares in a Flader Controlled Fund namely, the Exploration Fund. Trio was trustee of the Astarra Superannuation Plan, and had appointed WGI as its investment manager. The Exploration Fund purchased shares in Yarraman Winery Inc from Flader Vendor Companies. From the $6.559m of funds, $817,580 was transferred to a bank account located in Curacao, in the Netherlands Antilles, from which Mr Richard benefited personally. 

Circumstance B (1 July 2008 - 30 June 2009) : 
48Mr Richard, by using his positions at Trio and AAM, arranged for ASF to transfer $9.65m to purchase shares in new Flader Controlled Funds. He used EMA as the vehicle to effect this transfer. From this money, AAM received $5,356,541 and transferred to Mr Richard $252,794 for his own personal benefit. These monies were paid into a bank account in Liechtenstein maintained by Mr Richard. 

Charge Two 
49Charge Two refers to dishonest conduct of Mr Richards which relates to $10.4m of ASF funds invested into Flader Controlled Funds, in circumstances where Mr Richard knew that over $9.7m of those monies was to be used to purchase the assets of, or shares in, the Exploration Fund that were not otherwise convertible to cash. 

50It is not said that Mr Richard received any direct financial benefit from these transactions. 

51There are five separate sets of facts and circumstances relied upon by the Crown. 

Circumstances A and C (8 October- 19 December 2007, 22 May - 18 June 2008) : 
52Mr Richard, using his positions at Trio and AAM, arranged for ASF to enter five agreements investing a total of $6 million in new Flader Controlled Funds, via EMA. The money received was used by these funds to purchase shares from the Exploration Fund thereby providing liquidity to the Exploration Fund which used the money to fulfil the requested redemptions of the direct deposit made by the Australasian Conference Association Superannuation Trust and also by the ARP Growth Fund. 

Circumstance B (30 November - 14 December 2007) : 
53Mr Richard's dishonest conduct involved a false representation to the trustee of the Australasian Conference Association Superannuation Trust that the redemption value of its investment, as at 30 November 2007, was $982,899 less than the value of the investment as reflected in the internal records of the Exploration Fund. In other words, he lied to the Trustee so that the full amount of the investment was not returned to it, and almost $1m, to which it was not entitled, was kept by the Exploration Fund. 

Circumstance D (28 August 2008 - 31 March 2009) : 
54Similar to circumstances A and C, Mr Richard arranged for ASF to purchase shares in the Exploration Fund, on 10 occasions, to the value of $4.43m. The transactions facilitated ARP Growth's Fund requested redemptions, which were not otherwise possible due to the Exploration Fund's significantly overpriced shares that were not convertible to cash if not purchased by ASF. 

Circumstance E (1 November 2006 - 30 September 2009) : 
55Mr Richard arranged for ASF to enter 36 agreements via EMA, to the value of $34.9m, with the reference assets being shares in new Flader Controlled Funds. As previously described, these new funds were created by Mr Richard's dishonest conduct, after Trio's investment committee had placed a ban on further investment in the Exploration Fund and were falsely represented to be a diversification within ASF's investments. 

Charge to be taken into account - False Statements in contravention of s 1041E of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 

Circumstance A (10 April 2007 - 30 September 2009) : 
56Mr Richard made misleading statements by over-inflating the value of ASF's agreements with EMA, that were included in valuation statements to Trio, with the added likely effect of inducing Trio to enter more such agreements. 

Circumstance B (15 February 2006 - 31 August 2009) : 
57Mr Richard made materially misleading statements in a Product Disclosure Statement for ASF and in questionnaire responses relating to ASF, aware that these statements were like to induce Australians to apply for financial products, namely units in ASF. The statements related to the investment selection process, due diligence and monitoring. 

Seriousness of the Offences 
58The Crown submitted that this was a case which indicated ""...a very high degree of criminality not previously encountered by Australian Courts ."" 
It also submitted that the criminality demonstrated that the case "" ...approaches the very worst category of offences of their nature ."" 

59Mr Richard submitted that because it was an agreed fact that at all material times he had acted under the ultimate control and instruction of Mr Jack Flader, this was, whilst an example of serious criminality, not of the kind which the Crown submitted. 

60Mr Richard submitted that the correct way to view the seriousness of the offence, and the true nature of his criminal conduct was to regard it as the same criminality throughout the period of almost four years, namely that Mr Richards dishonestly operated a single scheme which included a number of transactions. Senior Counsel who appeared for Mr Richard accepted that an adequate description of that scheme was that it was a scheme designed to divert Australian investors' money from superannuation and managed investment funds into overseas hedge funds contrary to the interest of the investors in return for significant undisclosed payments. 

61It was argued that the seven separate episodes of criminal conduct referred to in the Statement of Facts were examples of this overall criminality. This it was said was the same criminality, and hence warranted the view that any sentence imposed for both offences warranted a substantial degree of concurrence. 

62Both the Crown and Mr Richard's submissions accept that Mr Richard was involved in a single scheme over the almost four years of his work with the Trio Capital Group. Both seem to accept that the seven episodes relied upon are individual instances over the entire period of Mr Richard's involvement with Trio Capital. The charges are not said to be representative ones. 

63It was put on behalf of Mr Richard that he was a nave and gullible personality who was "" ripe for the picking "". I accept, as does the Statement of Facts, that Mr Flader was the architect and ultimate controller of the scheme. I would be prepared to accept that at the commencement of his employment with the Trio Capital Group, Mr Richard was somewhat nave and gullible. He seemed to have been gratified by the attention which he was being given and, also, by his rapid promotion within the Trio Capital Group to a position of power and importance. 

64I am not satisfied however this remained the motivation throughout his time with the Trio Capital Group. The deceptions in which he engaged, knowing of the dishonesty of his conduct, seem to me to quickly tell against a nave, gullible man caught up, against his better judgment, in a dishonest scheme. His conduct bespeaks intentional and knowing participation in criminality over a long period for substantial personal gain. I am satisfied that this conduct was for nearly all of the four year period motivated simply by greed. 

65It is appropriate to note some features which assist in the assessment of the nature and circumstances of the offences and the seriousness of the criminality involved. They include: 

(a)the period of time over which the criminality occurred was from November 2005 to September 2009, namely, three years and ten months. This is a lengthy period; 

(b)the sum of monies involved in the criminal offences, and which was ultimately lost to Australian investors was $26.6m made up of $16.2m reflected in Charge 1 and $10.4m reflected in Charge 2. This is a very, very substantial sum; 

(c)he knew, or else must have known, that his conduct would cause a loss to the Australian investors; 

(d)Mr Richard personally received, in addition to his net annual salary of $113,426, over $1.3m in payments. Astarra Asset Management, a company of which he was a director, received $5.3m. These payments provided significant personal benefits for Mr Richard. He concealed the $1.3m in overseas bank accounts; 

(e)it is an element of both of the offences to which Mr Richard has pleaded guilty, that he knew at the time that his conduct was dishonest. As well with respect to the further offence to be taken into account, he admits that he knew that the statements he was making were materially misleading at the time he made them; 

(f)because the two principal offences are rolled up charges, they each include more than one episode of criminal conduct. Necessarily, the criminality involved is greater than with a charge in which only one episode of criminal conduct is relied upon; 

(g)the role Mr Richard played in the offences was a pivotal one. Whilst he may not have been the ultimate controller, a role attributed to Mr Flader, he was the central figure in Australia, without whose participation these offences could not have occurred. He knew what was happening across all of the corporate entities involved; 

(h)the offences involved active concealment and misleading conduct on Mr Richard's part in order to disguise the true nature of the transaction, and the actual conduct which was occurring; 

(i)Mr Richard engaged in conduct amounting to systematic deception in order to conceal the receipt of funds by him, including using private email accounts and overseas bank accounts to facilitate the concealment of the receipt of his personal benefit; 

(j)Mr Richard's conduct involved a gross breach of trust in knowingly acting contrary to the interests of corporations of which he was a director and officer which were entitled to have his complete attention; 

(k)he was motivated by greed, and could, had he so chosen, have withdrawn from his participation in the scheme at any time, or else reported it to the authorities, but he elected to continue with his dishonest conduct. 

66I regard the criminality as very serious indeed. Whilst I am not prepared to say it is an example of the most serious criminal conduct which offences of this kind encompass, it is nevertheless very serious. I would place it as nearing that upper range of criminality for both of the offences. 

67In forming this opinion, I have also had regard to the conduct underlying the offence against s 1041E (1) which I am asked to take into account when considering the first charge. 

The victims of the offences: s 16A(2)(d) Crimes Act 1914 
68The material tendered by the Crown did not establish the identity of any of the victims of the offences of Mr Richard. Obviously, it can be said that those who invested in one or other of the superannuation funds of the Trio Capital Group who were promoted and run by Mr Richard were victims. However, no individual detail of the personal circumstances of those investors is provided. 

69Exhibit D, a media release dated 13 April 2011 from the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, the Honourable Bill Shorten MP, provides some indication of the number of victims when it says this: 

""Over 5,000 victims of fraud from the collapse of Trio Capital Limited (Trio) will be compensated for their loss, following a Government decision announced today. 

...Bill Shorten today announced his decision to provide a grant of approximately $55 million in financial assistance to benefit the members of four superannuation funds that were formerly under the trusteeship of Trio. 

'Investors in APRA [Australian Prudential Regulation Authority] regulated funds deserve to be compensated by the Government when they lose their investments through fraud or other malfeasance by super fund trustees. I'm very pleased to be able to offer Trio investors this compensation' Mr Shorten said. 

...The grant of financial assistance will be recovered by way of a levy on regulated superannuation funds under the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993."" 

70It is immediately obvious by reference to the $55m figure stated, that the Media Release extends to cover losses greater than those involved in the offences to which Mr Richard has pleaded guilty. I note, for more abundant caution, that this sentence does not relate to the larger sum of money referred to by Mr Shorten, but rather the sum of $26.6m set out in the Statement of Facts. 

71It is also appropriate to note that funds lost as a consequence of Mr Richard's conduct included those invested by members in superannuation funds. Superannuation monies represent an important and significant element in the financial system in Australia and in ensuring its economic and financial stability. Superannuation monies represent the savings of individual members of the community which are intended to provide a secure retirement fund. The need for honesty is dealing with superannuation funds is self-evident. 

72The Crown in its submissions noted that other investors, including investors and self-managed superannuation funds would not be eligible to participate in the compensation package offered. It submitted that this result was dictated by the terms of the legislation. 

73It is notorious that most self-managed superannuation funds are small and less able to absorb investment losses, when compared with large funds of the kind regulated by APRA, which are more likely to have access to high quality advice, to have a portfolio of diversified investments and to have sophisticated oversight from APRA. Hence, large regulated funds are more likely to be able to more readily resist and to recover from lost investments. 

74The terms of the financial assistance grant announced by the Commonwealth Government means that, if there are individual investors or else self-managed superannuation funds who are victims of Mr Richard's conduct, they will be required to bear the losses themselves. 

75However, I am quite uncertain as to the detail of any of these victims who are not to be compensated by the Commonwealth Government and find myself unable on the present state of the evidence to make any specific finding about the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence. 

76The material tendered by Mr Richard indicates that there are 123 investors in the ASF, for whom a firm of solicitors act, who are contemplating bringing legal proceedings to recover their losses. Again, the identity of the individual investors is not made clear. This material provides a part of the picture, but it is an inadequate basis without more, upon which to base any findings. 

Any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence: s 16A(2)(e) Crimes Act 1914 
77As I have indicated earlier, I am satisfied that the losses involved in the offences amounted to $26.2m. This is a very large sum of money. 

78The liquidator of the various companies and funds within the Trio Capital Group have not been able to recover any of the funds which were dealt with by the conduct which is the subject of the charges. 

Contrition: s 16A(2)(f) Crimes Act 1914 
79I am obliged to have regard to, and take into account, the degree to which Mr Richard has shown contrition for the offence, including whether he has taken action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence. 

80I am satisfied that Mr Richard has shown significant contrition for the offence. 

81I have come to this conclusion based upon the following facts and matters: 

(a)his plea of guilty to the offences which was entered at the first available opportunity, and the fact that he made admissions to ASIC before he was charged; 

(b)the fact that he has given assistance to ASIC with respect to the affairs of the Trio Capital Group. The details of his assistance can be found in Exhibit B (a confidential exhibit); 

(c)his conduct in assisting Mr Roderick Mackay Sutherland, a trustee of his bankrupt estate, in particular by providing access to Liechtenstein banking documents and details of a loan to his parents, part of which was recovered satisfactorily by the liquidator; 

(d)he has provided assistance to other investors and bodies who have claims against Trio Capital. The details of this are to be found in Exhibit 1 and need not be recounted in full; 

(e)he has expressed his considerable regret and remorse for his offending behaviour to a number of people, including W John Taylor, a forensic psychologist, Mr Stephen Kleboe, the Probation and Parole officer who prepared a pre-sentence report, Mr Nicholas Polin, a barrister who had developed a social friendship with Mr Richard, and a number of other friends and acquaintances who have provided references. 

82Whilst he has not taken any specific action to make reparation for the particular loss resulting from the offence, he has helped in other ways with the broader affairs of Trio Capital, which I am satisfied demonstrates his contrition. 

Pleas of guilty: s 16A(2)(g) Crimes Act 1914 
83It is clear that the pleas of guilty to the offences that Mr Richard has entered have a real utilitarian value. 

84A plea of guilty is relevant for a court to consider in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed because such a plea saves the community a considerable amount of time and money, which contested committal hearings and trials would have involved. It is a substantial facilitation of the course of justice. Particularly when a plea is entered at the earliest opportunity, as it was here, the saving to the state and the facilitation of the course of justice is well recognised. 

85Whilst ASIC had conducted resource intensive enquiries in the months leading up to the offer of assistance by Mr Richard which ultimately resulted in the provision of the Statement of Facts (Exhibit A), the Crown concedes that ASIC would have had to expend further significant time and resources seeking to gather independent admissible evidence, including evidence from uncooperative witnesses from numerous overseas jurisdictions. The Crown accepts that the cooperation provided by Mr Richard was valuable to ASIC in bringing this matter to an early resolution, thus freeing up ASIC resources to be utilised for other investigations. 

86I propose to allow a discount of 25% with respect to any sentence which would otherwise be imposed to reflect Mr Richard's pleas of guilty, and the substantial facilitation of the course of justice, reflected by his conduct. 

Cooperation with law enforcement agencies: s 16A(2)(h) Crimes Act 1914 
87The details of cooperation by Mr Richard with ASIC are contained in Exhibit B. They are confidential and do not need to be discussed in this judgment. I assess them as significant and of value. I will allow an additional discount of 12.5% to reflect that assistance and the consequences that flow from it. That allowance is an additional one half of the discount allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 

88No application was made for a determination of the kind set out in s 21E(1) of the Crimes Act with respect to future assistance. No part of the discount, which I have just described, relates to future assistance. 

Deterrence 
89I earlier remarked upon the purpose of general deterrence and the fact that it is a relevant consideration. 

90In crimes of this kind, white collar crimes, the element of general deterrence is especially important because 

""...of the need to mark out plainly to others who might be minded to breach their professional or related obligations that such conduct will generally merit, in appropriate cases, condign punishment."" 

R v Rivkin (2003) 198 ALR 400 at [44] per Whealy J. 

91In R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330, Wood J (Carruthers J agreeing) said: 

""...those involved in serious white collar crime must expect condign sentences. The commercial world expects executives and employees in positions of trust, no matter how young they may be, to conform to exacting standard of honesty. It is impossible to be unmindful of the difficulty of detecting sophisticated crime of the kind here involved, or of the possibility for substantial financial loss by the public. Executives and trusted employees who give way to temptation cannot pass the blame to lax security on the part of management. The element of general deterrence is an important element of sentencing for such offences: Glenister [1980] 2 NSWLR 597."" 

92Remarks to similar effect can be found in other cases including R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119 per Wood CJ at CL, Adams and Bell JJ at [56]; Higgins v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 38 at [13] per Spigelman CJ (Barr and Howie JJ agreeing); R v Howard [2003] NSWSC 1248 at [47] per Kirby J; R v Corner (NSWCCA, 19 December 1997, unreported) per Powell, Beazley JJA and Sperling J; R v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315 per Wood CJ at CL at [44]-[48] and Director of Public Prosecutions v Bulfin [1998] 4 VR 114 at 131-132. 

93General deterrence must loom large in any sentence which is imposed in this matter. 

94Specific deterrence is something to which attention must also be paid: s 16A(2)(j) of the Crimes Act . The evidence satisfies me, as is often the case in white-collar crimes, that Mr Richard is unlikely to offend again. That is for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, the enforceable undertaking which he has entered into with ASIC (Ex C), the fact that he was of prior good character and has expressed contrition and remorse for the offences and the fact that such reputation as he had in the commercial community has been destroyed. 

95This conclusion is confirmed by the expert reports of Mr W John Taylor, a forensic psychologist who formed the view that Mr Richard had a low risk of re-offending and had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

96Specific deterrence does not loom large and requires little, if any, weight in the sentencing process in this case. 

The need to ensure that punishment is adequate for the offence: s 16A(2)(k) Crimes Act 1914 
97The Court is required to ensure that the punishment is adequate for the offence. 

98This is a brief legislative reference to one of the key principles of sentencing, namely the totality principle. 

99The practical expression of the totality principle which has been cited with approval is that of Lord Widgery CJ in Regina v Faulkner (1972) 56 Cr.App.R. 594 at 596 where his Lordship used this language: 

""[A]t the end of the day, as one always must, one looks at the totality and asks whether it was too much."" 

100The obligation on the Court to consider the principle of totality as part of approaching the sentencing of a federal offender is clear: see Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at 622 [15] per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [25] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. 

101The practical application of the principle in cases involving more than one charge and sentence, such as this one, is demonstrated by what the High Court of Australia said in Mill v the Queen [1998] 166 CLR 59 at 63: 

""Where the principle falls to be applied in relation to sentences of imprisonment imposed by a single sentencing court, an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred."" 

102In considering this issue, it is also necessary to say something about the use, in this case, of what are called "" rolled up charges "". 

103As I have earlier explained in these remarks, underlying each of the charges are a number of different episodes of conduct, each of which is in breach of the legislation. 

104Rolled up charges can be brought by the Crown only where there is agreement with the offender and when there is a plea of guilty. If either (or both) of these elements were missing, the charges presently before the Court would be bad for duplicity and would be liable to be struck down. 

105The use of rolled up charges by the Crown is a matter of considerable advantage to an offender: R v Jones [2004] VSCA 68 at [13] per Charles JA (Phillips JA and Bongiorno AJA agreeing). The advantage to the offender is that the use of a rolled up charge restricts the maximum available sentence to that prescribed by the legislation for the single offence, rather than the total theoretically available maximum sentence from multiple charges. 

106In this case, the Crown submitted that there was a public interest in presenting rolled up charges. It said that rolled up charges encouraged pleas of guilty and made more efficient the discharge of the Court's workload. It also submitted that presenting the indictment with two rolled charges provided an appropriate available maximum sentence which sufficiently reflected the underlying criminality of Mr Richard's criminal conduct. 

107I acknowledge, as did Charles JA in Jones that a rolled up count can ease the task of a sentencing judge. It does so by limiting the number of separate charges upon which a sentence is necessary and, as a result, limits the range of sentences available. 

108The other reason that there is a benefit to an offender who pleads guilty to a rolled up charge is that, as only one sentence is imposed for all of the episodes of criminality, the sentence in effect represents a complete concurrence of separate sentences which might otherwise have been imposed for those separate episodes of criminality. 

109The fact that here the charges are rolled up charges is a relevant matter to which regard must be had in considering the principle of totality and, in particular, questions of concurrence and accumulation of the sentences to be imposed on the individual charges. 

Subjective features of Mr Richard: s 16A(2)(m) and s 16A(2)(n) Crimes Act 1914 
110I need to have regard to the character, antecedents, age, physical and mental condition of Mr Richard and the prospect of his rehabilitation. Mr Richard gave no evidence on his plea about these matters or at all. However, a considerable amount of material was tendered including expert reports and letters of reference. I have had regard to, and been informed by, that material in expressing the conclusions which follow. 

111Mr Richard at the time of sentencing is 36 years of age. He is single. He is a native of Canada where his parents and sister reside. He has no family in Australia. 

112He was raised in a stable family and was close to both his parents. He left school at the age of 18 years having completed 12 years of education. He attended university and studied for two years towards a Bachelor of Administration. He did not complete that course. 

113He has a satisfactory history of past employment. He left home at the age of 22 when he came to Australia on a holiday in 1997. In February 1998 he went to Taiwan where he stayed for a couple of years and then ultimately returned to Australia. 

114He came to Australia in 2002 for the purpose of working in the Trio Capital Group. He is a permanent resident of Australia. He has made friends with people in Australia but is not in any permanent relationship. He will have some, but not much, support whilst in custody. 

115In January 2011, Mr Richard was made a bankrupt. 

116He has not committed any previous criminal offences. The Crown accepts, as do I, that prior to his involvement with the Trio Capital Group, he was a man of good character. 

117The expert evidence of Mr W John Taylor, which I accept, is that he has a low potential for re-offending and has good prospects for rehabilitation. 

118However, in the area of white collar crimes many offenders are in a like position, namely that the crime is their first offence, they are otherwise of good character and are unlikely to re-offend and have good prospects of rehabilitation in the present circumstances. Whilst each of these considerations, which are particular to Mr Richard, is entitled to some weight, they do not deserve much weight. 

Section 17A Crimes Act 1914 
119If a sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed, then I need to be satisfied that such a sentence is the only appropriate sentence. 

120There are four matters which I consider require a conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence: 

(a)The circumstances of the offence and the seriousness of the criminality involved - as I have explained in [ REF _Ref300838417 \r \h It is appropriate to note some features which assist in the assessment of the nature and circumstances of the offences and the seriousness of the criminality involved. They include: ] above, each of the elements there described demonstrate a high degree of criminality; 

(b)The number of offences and their nature - although there are only two offences against s 1041G of the Corporations Act , these are rolled up offences and seven episodes of criminality are involved. The additional charge needs also to be included in this assessment. As well, the law regards an offence against s 1041G as a serious one; 

(c)Importance of general deterrence for white collar crimes - as the authorities demonstrate, general deterrence is an important factor. The ""real bite"" of general deterrence only takes hold when a custodial sentence is imposed; R v Boulden [2006] NSWSC 1274 per Whealy J at [51]; Braun v R [2008] NSWCCA 269 at [85] per Hall J (McClellan CJ at CL, Harrison J agreeing); 

(d)Personal circumstances - there is nothing about Mr Richard's personal circumstances which are fully described in [ REF _Ref300838479 \r \h I need to have regard to the character, antecedents, age, physical and mental condition of Mr Richard and the prospect of his rehabilitation. Mr Richard gave no evidence on his plea about these matters or at all. ]-[ REF _Ref300838486 \r \h However, in the area of white collar crimes many offenders are in a like position, namely that the crime is their first offence, they are otherwise of good character and are unlikely to re-offend and have good prospects of rehabilitation in the present circumstances. Whilst each of these considerations, which are particular to Mr Richard, is entitled to some weight, they do not deserve much weight. ] above which would make a sentence of imprisonment inappropriate. 

For these reasons I am satisfied that nothing less than a sentence of imprisonment would be sufficient in this case. 

121Counsel for Mr Richard did not make a submission to the contrary of this. 

Sentence 
122Mr Richard is guilty of serious crimes of a high order. They were carefully considered and planned, they were concealed, they continued over a period of nearly four years and they led to significant financial losses in excess of $26m. Mr Richard knew that what he was doing was dishonest, that he was providing misleading information to those entitled to accurate information and that in respect of the criminality encompassed by Charge One, he received over $1m personally, which was a very significant personal benefit. 

123The maximum sentence provided by the legislation in respect of each count is five years. 

124On Charge One, a sentence of four years imprisonment would reflect the serious criminality of the offence and the subjective circumstances of Mr Richard. This is a sentence which equates to 80% of the maximum available. 

125But Mr Richard is entitled to a discount because of the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty and because of the assistance that he has provided to authorities. Applying the discount of 37.5%, the result is a reduction of 18 months so that the appropriate sentence is one of two and a half years imprisonment. 

126On Charge Two, I assess the seriousness of the criminality involved and the subjective circumstances of Mr Richard as being of the same extent as in Charge One. The same sentence is warranted. 

127The appropriate sentence on Charge Two would also be four years. Again, applying the discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty and because of the assistance that he has provided to authorities, the resulting appropriate sentence is two and a half years. 

128I turn next to considering the principle of totality. The two offences have significant common elements. The corporate structure, context and environment were the same. The method of carrying out the offence involved similar features. However, the matters are not identical. Some measure of accumulation is appropriate, but I do not agree that the sentences ought to be completely or very largely concurrent. This would not adequately reflect the totality of the criminality involved. It would also not reflect the fact that the rolled up charges include a significant measure of concurrency. 

129I will allow one half of the first sentence as the appropriate extent of accumulation. Accordingly, the sentence for the second offence will commence 15 months after the start of the first sentence. 

130This means that the overall period of the two sentences will be a total of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment. 

131I am required to determine how much of this sentence Mr Richard will spend in custody and how much, if any, will be subject to a non-parole order or a recognizance release order (s 19AB Crimes Act ). 

132In considering whether to fix, and if so what, period is to be served in custody before either a parole period is able to begin, or else when a recognizance release order should be made to operate from, there is no fixed rule or formula: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45. 

133What is necessary is to have regard to Part 1B of the Crimes Act , and to fix a sentence which is of appropriate severity to reflect the crime involved. The sentences which are imposed must have a deterrent and a punitive effect: Hili at [63]; R v Ruha [2010] QCA 10 at [45]. 

134At the request of the Crown and Mr Richard, in light of the evidence in the confidential exhibits, I will recommend to the Corrective Service authorities that the custodial part of the sentence which I impose be served by Mr Richard in protection in the special management area. In fixing the period Mr Richard will spend in custody, I will take into account the fact that his term of imprisonment will be more restricted and more difficult than if he were not so confined. 

135Looking at the overall degree of criminality and having regard to all other relevant matters, I am satisfied that an appropriate period for Mr Richard to spend in custody before being released pursuant to a recognizance release order is two years and six months. 

Orders 
136Mr Richard: 

(a)On Charge One: I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for two years and six months commencing on 22 July 2011 and concluding on 21 January 2014. 

(b)On Charge Two: I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of two years and six months commencing on 22 October 2012 and concluding on 21 April 2015. 

(c)I recommend to the prison authorities that you be placed in protection in the special management area within the prison system. 

(d)I order that you be released upon entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour after you have served two years and six months, namely on 21 January 2014. 


Explanation 
137Section 16F(2) of the Crimes Act requires me to give an explanation of the purpose and consequence of making the recognizance release order. Here is that explanation: 

(a)The sentences which I have imposed require that you serve a period in custody of two and a half years and then a further period of one year and three months in the community which is the balance of the whole of the sentences; 

(b)The order is subject to the condition that you be of good behaviour during this period of fifteen months whilst your liberty is subject to the order; 

(c)If you are not, without reasonable excuse, of good behaviour, you will be in breach of the order and you will likely be returned to custody for the remainder of your sentence; 

(d)The recognizance may be discharged or varied under s 20AA of the Crimes Act .
